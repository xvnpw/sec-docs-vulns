- Vulnerability Name: Cgroup Path Traversal due to Insufficient Input Validation

- Description:
  - The `cgpath` parameter, which specifies the cgroup path to be monitored and managed by Senpai, is taken directly from user input without sufficient validation.
  - An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted `cgpath` containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to escape the intended cgroup directory.
  - When Senpai uses this manipulated `cgpath` to construct file paths for cgroup operations (reading pressure, writing memory limits), it can access and modify files in unintended cgroup directories.
  - By targeting a different cgroup path, an attacker can cause Senpai to apply memory pressure and adjust memory limits on containers or cgroups that were not intended to be managed.
  - This can lead to resource starvation or instability in those unintended targets.

- Impact:
  - Resource starvation and performance degradation for unintended containers or cgroups.
  - Potential instability of the host system if critical system cgroups are targeted (depending on system configuration and permissions).
  - Unauthorized modification of memory limits for arbitrary cgroups on the system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The application directly uses the user-provided `cgpath` without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization for the `cgpath` parameter.
  - Implement checks to ensure that the provided `cgpath` is a valid cgroup path and potentially restrict it to be within an expected base directory.
  - Consider using a safer method to handle cgroup paths, potentially using a library that provides secure path manipulation or cgroup management.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to execute the `senpai.py` script and control the command-line arguments, specifically the `cgpath` parameter.
  - The attacker needs to have sufficient permissions to run Senpai and for Senpai to interact with cgroup files.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - In `senpai.py`, the `argparse` module is used to parse command-line arguments.
  - The `cgpath` argument is defined as: `parser.add_argument('cgpath', type=str)`.
  - The value provided for `cgpath` is directly assigned to `conf.cgpath` without any validation.
  - In the `Senpai` class constructor, `self.conf.cgpath` is passed to the `Cgroup` class constructor: `self.cgroup = Cgroup(self.conf.cgpath, ...)`.
  - In the `Cgroup` class constructor, the `path` attribute is initialized directly from the provided `cgpath`: `self.path = path`.
  - The `self.path` attribute is used in the `read` and `write` methods of the `Cgroup` class with `os.path.join`:
    ```python
    def read(self, filename):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename)) as f:
            return f.read()

    def write(self, filename, string):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename), 'w') as f:
            f.write(string)
    ```
  - **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (cgpath) --> argparse --> conf.cgpath --> Senpai.__init__ --> Cgroup.__init__ --> Cgroup.path
    Cgroup.path ----------> os.path.join(Cgroup.path, filename) --> File operations (read/write)
    ```
  - As shown in the code flow, the user-controlled `cgpath` is directly incorporated into file paths without any sanitization. This allows path traversal if the user provides a `cgpath` like `/../../unintended_cgroup`. For example, if the intended `cgpath` is `/sys/fs/cgroup/mycontainer` and the attacker provides `/sys/fs/cgroup/../../othercontainer`, the `os.path.join` will resolve to `/sys/fs/cgroup/othercontainer/<filename>`, allowing access to `othercontainer` cgroup files.

- Security Test Case:
  - Precondition: Assume Senpai is running on a system with cgroups v2 mounted at `/sys/fs/cgroup`. Assume there are at least two cgroups: `test_cgroup_intended` and `test_cgroup_unintended` under `/sys/fs/cgroup/`.
  - Step 1: Create two cgroups for testing:
    ```bash
    mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended
    mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_unintended
    ```
  - Step 2: Run Senpai, targeting `test_cgroup_intended` initially and observe its behavior:
    ```bash
    sudo python3 senpai.py /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended
    ```
    - Observe in the logs that Senpai is interacting with files within `/sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended`.
  - Step 3: In a separate terminal, monitor the `memory.high` file for both cgroups:
    ```bash
    watch "cat /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended/memory.high ; cat /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_unintended/memory.high"
    ```
  - Step 4: Stop the Senpai process from Step 2.
  - Step 5: Run Senpai again, but this time provide a malicious `cgpath` to target `test_cgroup_unintended` while pretending to target `test_cgroup_intended`:
    ```bash
    sudo python3 senpai.py /sys/fs/cgroup/../../test_cgroup_unintended
    ```
  - Step 6: Observe the output of the `watch` command from Step 3.
  - Expected Result:
    - In Step 2, you should see the `memory.high` value of `test_cgroup_intended` being modified by Senpai. The `memory.high` value of `test_cgroup_unintended` should remain unchanged.
    - In Step 5 and 6, you should observe that despite providing `/sys/fs/cgroup/../../test_cgroup_unintended` as `cgpath`, Senpai is actually modifying the `memory.high` value of `/sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_unintended` instead of `/sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended`. This confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as Senpai is operating on the unintended cgroup due to the manipulated `cgpath`.
