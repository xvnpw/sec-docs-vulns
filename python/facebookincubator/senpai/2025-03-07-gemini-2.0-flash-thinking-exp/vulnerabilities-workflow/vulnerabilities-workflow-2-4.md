- Vulnerability Name: Cgroup Path Injection
- Description:
    An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted cgroup path as a command-line argument to Senpai. Senpai uses this path to interact with cgroup files to monitor and adjust memory limits. By providing a path with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) or an absolute path pointing to a different cgroup, an attacker can trick Senpai into managing the memory limits of unintended containers.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker gains access to execute the `senpai.py` script.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious cgroup path. This path can use relative path traversal (e.g., `/sys/fs/cgroup/../../unintended_cgroup`) or an absolute path to target a cgroup outside the intended scope.
    3. The attacker executes `senpai.py` providing the malicious cgroup path as a command-line argument: `./senpai.py /sys/fs/cgroup/../../unintended_cgroup`.
    4. Senpai, without proper validation, uses the attacker-supplied path to interact with cgroup files.
    5. Senpai starts monitoring and adjusting memory limits of the cgroup specified in the malicious path, which is not the intended target.
- Impact:
    An attacker can manipulate the memory limits of arbitrary cgroups on the system. This can lead to:
    - Resource misallocation for unintended containers: Senpai might aggressively reduce the memory limit of a critical container, causing performance degradation or instability.
    - Instability of unintended containers: Incorrect memory limit adjustments by Senpai can lead to thrashing or out-of-memory errors in unintended containers.
    - Potential denial of service for unintended containers: By setting extremely low memory limits, an attacker can effectively cause a denial of service for targeted containers.
    - In scenarios with misconfigured cgroup namespaces, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone towards container escape, although this is a more complex exploit scenario.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The provided code does not include any input validation or sanitization for the cgroup path. The `senpai.py` script directly accepts the provided path and uses it to interact with the cgroup filesystem.
- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation and sanitization for the `cgpath` argument are missing.
    - Path validation: Implement checks to ensure the provided cgroup path is valid and conforms to expected patterns. This could involve verifying that the path starts with `/sys/fs/cgroup/` and does not contain unexpected components.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize the input path to prevent path traversal sequences like `../`. Use secure path manipulation functions that resolve paths safely and prevent directory traversal. Consider canonicalizing the path and verifying it's still within the expected base directory.
    - Principle of least privilege: While not a direct mitigation for path injection, running Senpai with minimal privileges can reduce the potential impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `senpai.py` script. This could be through direct access to the system, or indirectly if the script is exposed through a web interface or other service.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the script, specifically the `cgpath` argument.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Argument Parsing: The `senpai.py` script uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments. The cgroup path is accepted as a positional argument:
    ```python
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(...)
    parser.add_argument('cgpath', type=str)
    conf = parser.parse_args()
    ```
    The `cgpath` argument is read as a string without any validation at this stage.

    2. Cgroup Class Initialization: The `cgpath` from the parsed arguments is passed directly to the `Cgroup` class constructor:
    ```python
    self.cgroup = Cgroup(self.conf.cgpath,
                         self.conf.min_size,
                         self.conf.max_size)
    ```
    Inside the `Cgroup` class `__init__` method, the provided `path` is directly assigned to `self.path`:
    ```python
    class Cgroup(object):
        def __init__(self, path, limit_min, limit_max):
            self.path = path
            # ...
    ```
    No validation or sanitization is performed on the `path` here either.

    3. File Path Construction:  Methods within the `Cgroup` class use `os.path.join(self.path, filename)` to construct the full paths to cgroup files:
    ```python
    def read(self, filename):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename)) as f:
            return f.read()

    def write(self, filename, string):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename), 'w') as f:
            f.write(string)
    ```
    `os.path.join` is designed to correctly join path components, but it does not prevent path traversal vulnerabilities if `self.path` itself contains malicious path components like `../`. For example, if `self.path` is `/sys/fs/cgroup/../../unintended_cgroup` and `filename` is `memory.high`, `os.path.join` will produce `/sys/fs/cgroup/../../unintended_cgroup/memory.high`, effectively targeting the unintended cgroup.

    Visualization:

    ```
    User Input (cgpath) --> argparse --> conf.cgpath --> Cgroup.__init__(path) --> Cgroup.self.path
                                                                    |
                                                                    |-----> os.path.join(Cgroup.self.path, filename) --> file operations
    ```
    The flow shows that the user-provided `cgpath` is directly used to construct file paths without any intermediate validation or sanitization, leading to the path injection vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prerequisites:
        - A Linux system with cgroup v2 enabled.
        - Python 3 installed.
        - The `senpai.py` script.
        - Create two test cgroups: `test_cgroup_intended` and `test_cgroup_unintended` within the cgroup filesystem. For example, using `sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended` and `sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_unintended`.
    2. Steps:
        - Open three terminal windows.
        - **Terminal 1 (Monitor Intended Cgroup):** Monitor the `memory.high` file of the intended cgroup:
          ```bash
          while true; do sudo cat /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended/memory.high; sleep 1; done
          ```
        - **Terminal 2 (Monitor Unintended Cgroup):** Monitor the `memory.high` file of the unintended cgroup:
          ```bash
          while true; do sudo cat /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_unintended/memory.high; sleep 1; done
          ```
        - **Terminal 3 (Run Senpai with Intended Path):** Run `senpai.py` with the intended cgroup path and note the memory adjustments in Terminal 1:
          ```bash
          sudo ./senpai.py /sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended
          ```
          Observe in Terminal 1 that the `memory.high` value is being modified by Senpai. Observe in Terminal 2 that `memory.high` value is not being modified.
        - Stop the Senpai process in Terminal 3 (e.g., Ctrl+C).
        - **Terminal 3 (Run Senpai with Malicious Path):** Run `senpai.py` with a malicious cgroup path targeting the unintended cgroup:
          ```bash
          sudo ./senpai.py /sys/fs/cgroup/../test_cgroup_unintended
          ```
          Observe in Terminal 2 that the `memory.high` value is now being modified by Senpai. Observe in Terminal 1 that `memory.high` value is no longer being modified.
    3. Expected Result:
        - When Senpai is run with the intended path `/sys/fs/cgroup/test_cgroup_intended`, only the `memory.high` file of `test_cgroup_intended` is modified.
        - When Senpai is run with the malicious path `/sys/fs/cgroup/../test_cgroup_unintended`, the `memory.high` file of `test_cgroup_unintended` is modified instead of the intended cgroup, demonstrating successful cgroup path injection.
