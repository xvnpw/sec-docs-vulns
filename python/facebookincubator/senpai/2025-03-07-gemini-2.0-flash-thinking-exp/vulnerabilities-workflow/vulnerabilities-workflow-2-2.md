### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal in Cgroup Path Argument

- Description:
  - The Senpai application takes the cgroup path as a command-line argument (`cgpath`).
  - This `cgpath` is used to construct file paths for accessing cgroup files (e.g., memory.pressure, memory.high) within the specified cgroup directory.
  - An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted `cgpath` containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to escape the intended cgroup directory.
  - By manipulating the `cgpath`, an attacker can potentially access and modify cgroup files of other containers or even the host system, depending on the cgroup filesystem configuration and permissions.
  - This allows for unauthorized modification of memory limits for unintended cgroups.

- Impact:
  - **Unauthorized Modification of Memory Limits:** An attacker can modify the memory limits of arbitrary cgroups on the system. This could lead to:
    - **Resource Starvation:** Reducing memory limits of other containers or system services, causing performance degradation or crashes.
    - **Privilege Escalation (in certain scenarios):** While not direct privilege escalation to root, manipulating cgroup limits can indirectly impact the resource allocation and behavior of other processes, potentially leading to unexpected or exploitable conditions.
    - **Container Escape (in extreme cases, less likely but theoretically possible depending on cgroupfs misconfiguration):** In highly misconfigured environments where cgroupfs is not properly isolated, it might be theoretically possible to influence host-level cgroups, although this is less common in standard container setups.
  - **Information Disclosure (limited):** While primarily a modification vulnerability, in some scenarios, reading other cgroup files might lead to limited information disclosure about resource usage of other containers.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The application directly uses the provided `cgpath` argument without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The application should validate the `cgpath` argument to ensure it is a valid cgroup path and does not contain path traversal sequences.
  - **Path Canonicalization:** Before using the `cgpath`, the application should canonicalize it to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path components (e.g., `.` and `..`). This can help prevent traversal attempts.
  - **Restrict Path Scope:** The application could be designed to only operate within a predefined base cgroup path and reject any `cgpath` that attempts to go outside of this base path.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to provide the `cgpath` argument to the Senpai application. This could be achieved if:
    - Senpai is exposed as a service and allows users to specify the cgroup path.
    - Senpai is used by another application that is vulnerable to argument injection and allows controlling the `cgpath` passed to Senpai.
    - The attacker has direct access to the Senpai execution environment and can modify the command-line arguments.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/senpai.py`**
  - **Class `Cgroup` `__init__` method:**
    ```python
    class Cgroup(object):
        def __init__(self, path, limit_min, limit_max):
            self.path = path
            # ... rest of the code
    ```
    - The `__init__` method of the `Cgroup` class takes the `path` argument directly from the `Senpai` class initialization, which in turn gets it from the command-line argument `cgpath` without any checks.
  - **`Cgroup` `read`, `readlines`, `write` methods:**
    ```python
    def read(self, filename):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename)) as f:
            return f.read()

    def readlines(self, filename):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename)) as f:
            return f.readlines()

    def write(self, filename, string):
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, filename), 'w') as f:
        f.write(string)
    ```
    - These methods use `os.path.join(self.path, filename)` to construct the full path to cgroup files.
    - Because `self.path` is directly derived from the user-provided `cgpath` argument, any path traversal sequences in `cgpath` will be preserved and used in `os.path.join`.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      User Input (cgpath) --> Senpai (cgpath argument) --> Cgroup.__init__(path) --> Cgroup.path
                                                                    |
                                                                    |-- os.path.join(Cgroup.path, filename) --> File Access
      ```
    - **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
      1. The user executes `senpai.py` and provides a malicious `cgpath` argument, for example: `../other_cgroup`.
      2. The `argparse` module parses the `cgpath` argument and passes it to the `Senpai` class constructor.
      3. The `Senpai` class constructor creates a `Cgroup` object, passing the malicious `cgpath` to the `Cgroup` constructor.
      4. The `Cgroup` constructor initializes `self.path` with the malicious path.
      5. When `Senpai` or `Cgroup` methods call `Cgroup.read`, `Cgroup.readlines`, or `Cgroup.write`, the `os.path.join` function constructs file paths using the malicious `self.path`.
      6. This allows accessing files relative to the attacker-controlled path, potentially outside the intended cgroup.

- Security Test Case:
  - **Pre-requisites:**
    - A Linux system with cgroup v2 mounted.
    - Python 3 installed.
    - The Senpai code (`senpai.py`) available.
    - Identify a target cgroup path to manipulate (e.g., `/sys/fs/cgroup/`). For testing purposes within a container, you might need to find a writable cgroup path outside the intended container cgroup, or simulate such an environment.  For demonstration, we will attempt to access the root cgroup.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `senpai.py`.
    2. Execute Senpai with a path traversal payload in the `cgpath` argument. For example, to target the root cgroup (assuming it exists and is accessible for demonstration):
       ```bash
       ./senpai.py '../'
       ```
       Or, to target a sibling cgroup directory, assuming there is a sibling directory named `sibling_cgroup` relative to the current cgroup:
       ```bash
       ./senpai.py '../sibling_cgroup'
       ```
       For a safer test within the current cgroup hierarchy, if you know the parent cgroup path, you can try to access a file in the parent:
       ```bash
       ./senpai.py '../'
       ```
       And then observe if Senpai attempts to read/write files in the parent directory. To make it explicit, you can try to access a known file in the parent directory, although Senpai itself doesn't directly read arbitrary files, it reads specific cgroup files.  A more direct test is to see if you can influence a different cgroup's memory limit.
    3. Observe the output of Senpai. If the path traversal is successful, Senpai might attempt to interact with cgroup files in the traversed directory (e.g., print logs related to the traversed path, or potentially modify memory limits if it has permissions).  **Note:** Directly observing the *modification* of another cgroup's limit might be complex in a typical container environment due to permissions and isolation.  A simpler test is to observe if Senpai *attempts* to access files in the traversed path, which indicates the vulnerability is present. Look for log messages that show Senpai trying to read or write to paths outside the intended cgroup, based on the malicious `cgpath`.
    4. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, Senpai will operate using the traversed path. You might see error messages if permissions are denied when trying to access files in the traversed path, but the attempt itself proves the path traversal vulnerability.  If successful in writing, you might observe changes in memory limits of unintended cgroups (this requires careful monitoring and might be harder to verify directly without specific setup and permissions).  For a simpler verification, check if Senpai starts logging paths that include the traversal sequence, indicating it's using the manipulated path.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially break out of the intended cgroup context and manipulate memory limits of other cgroups by supplying a malicious `cgpath`.
