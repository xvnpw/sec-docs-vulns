## Vulnerability Report

### Command Injection via `-t` option

* **Description:**
    1. The `fiosynth` application accepts user input through the `-t` option, intended to specify a "Health Monitoring Tool Syntax" for health monitoring.
    2. This user-provided input string is passed to the `health_tools.py` script and subsequently to the `HealthTools.logger` function.
    3. The `HealthTools.logger` function, located in `/code/fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py`, uses `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)` to execute the provided syntax string as a system command.
    4. The critical vulnerability lies in the use of `shell=True` within `subprocess.Popen`. This argument enables shell command interpretation, allowing for command injection.
    5. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious string and providing it as input to the `-t` option. When `fiosynth` executes, these injected commands will be executed by the system shell.
    6. For example, providing `-t "; touch /tmp/pwned"` would execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system.

* **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution on the system where `fiosynth` is running.
    - This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the affected system.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be stolen from the system.
        - **Data Manipulation/Destruction:** Critical system files or user data can be modified or deleted, leading to data integrity issues or system instability.
        - **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** If `fiosynth` is run with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`), the attacker can gain those elevated privileges, potentially achieving root access.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly executes the user-provided string from the `-t` option without any input sanitization, validation, or security measures.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `-t` option. This should include:
        - **Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters or command structures for the health monitoring syntax.
        - **Input Validation:** Validate the user-provided input against the expected syntax to ensure it conforms to a safe format and prevent injection of unexpected commands or characters.
        - **Escaping:** If dynamic command construction is necessary, use proper escaping mechanisms (e.g., `shlex.quote()` in Python) to prevent shell interpretation of special characters.
    - **Avoid `shell=True`:**  The most critical mitigation is to avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen`. Instead, execute commands as lists of arguments with `shell=False`. This prevents the shell from interpreting metacharacters and mitigates command injection risks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `fiosynth` with the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. This limits the potential impact of a successful command injection by restricting the attacker's access and actions within the system.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `fiosynth` script. This could be through direct access to the system or potentially via a web interface if `fiosynth` is integrated into a web application.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to `fiosynth`, specifically the `-t` option. No prior authentication or elevated privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability beyond the ability to run the script with arguments.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Argument Parsing (`fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py`):**
        - The `set_attributes()` function uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments and defines the `-t` option:
        ```python
        parser.add_argument(
            "-t",
            action="store",
            dest="health",
            type=str,
            help="(Optional) Enter Health Monitoring Tool Syntax (default = )",
            default="",
        )
        ```
        - The value provided to `-t` is stored in `args.health`.
    2. **Passing `-t` value to `runHealthMon` (`fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py`):**
        - The `runHealthMon` function is called within `runSuite` and receives `args.health` as the `health` argument:
        ```python
        def runHealthMon(fname, health="", flash=None):
            if health != "":
                runHealthTool = health_tools.HealthTools()
                runHealthTool.logger(health)
            # ...
        ```
    3. **Execution in `HealthTools.logger` (`fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py`):**
        - The `HealthTools.logger` function receives the `syntax` argument and executes it using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`:
        ```python
        class HealthTools:
            def logger(self, syntax):
                FILENAME = "health.log"
                file_ = open(FILENAME, "a")
                subprocess.Popen("date", stdout=file_)
                subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True) # Vulnerable line
                file_.close()
        ```
        - **Vulnerable Line:** `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)` is the source of the vulnerability. The `syntax` variable, directly derived from the user-controlled `-t` option, is executed as a shell command without sanitization due to `shell=True`.

        D --> E[fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py:HealthTools.logger]
        E --> F[subprocess.Popen(syntax, shell=True)]
        F -- User Input (-t option) --> E
    ```

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure `fiosynth` is installed or runnable from the project directory.
        - Verify that `fio` and `python3` are installed and accessible.
        - The test environment should be a Linux-based system as per the application's requirements.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Open a terminal and navigate to the `fiosynth` project directory.
        - Execute `fiosynth.py` with a command injection payload using the `-t` option. For example, to create a file named `pwned_file` in the `/tmp` directory, use the following command:
        ```bash
        python3 fiosynth.py -d /dev/null -w PeakWklds -f test_command_injection -t "touch /tmp/pwned_file"
        ```
        - Replace `/dev/null` with a valid device if required by your setup. `PeakWklds` and `test_command_injection` are placeholders for a workload suite and output filename respectively.
    3. **Verification:**
        - After the `fiosynth` command completes execution, check for the existence of the file `/tmp/pwned_file`.
        - Use the command `ls /tmp/pwned_file` to verify its creation.
        - If the file `pwned_file` exists in `/tmp`, it confirms that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned_file` was successfully executed, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability.
        - For further validation, examine the `health.log` file created by `fiosynth` to observe the execution logs and potentially the output of other injected commands.

This security test case clearly demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands through the `-t` option in `fiosynth`, confirming the critical command injection vulnerability.
