* Vulnerability 1: Command Injection in Health Monitoring Tool
  * Description:
    1. The `fiosynth` application accepts a `-t` argument, intended to specify the syntax for a health monitoring tool.
    2. This argument is passed to the `HealthTools.logger` function in `fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py`.
    3. Inside `HealthTools.logger`, the provided syntax is directly executed using `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)`.
    4. The use of `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen` allows for shell command injection.
    5. An attacker can craft a malicious command within the `-t` argument.
    6. When `fiosynth` is executed with this crafted `-t` argument, the malicious command will be executed by the system shell.
    7. For example, an attacker could use `-t "malicious_command; id"` to execute the `id` command along with other malicious commands.
  * Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running `fiosynth` with the privileges of the `fiosynth` process. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
  * Vulnerability rank: Critical
  * Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The code directly executes the user-provided string without any sanitization or validation.
  * Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Sanitize or validate the `-t` argument to ensure it only contains expected characters and commands. A whitelist approach for allowed commands or characters would be more secure than a blacklist.
    - Use `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False` and pass command arguments as a list. This avoids shell interpretation and command injection vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of least privilege: Run `fiosynth` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of command execution vulnerabilities.
  * Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious workload suite JSON file to a user.
    2. The user must execute `fiosynth` with the crafted workload suite and include the `-t` argument with a malicious command.
  * Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py`
    ```python
    import subprocess

    class HealthTools:
        def logger(self, syntax):
            FILENAME = "health.log"
            file_ = open(FILENAME, "a")
            subprocess.Popen("date", stdout=file_)
            subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True) # Vulnerable line
            file_.close()
    ```
    - The `HealthTools.logger` function takes `syntax` as input.
    - This `syntax` variable comes directly from the `-t` command-line argument of `fiosynth.py`.
    - `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)` executes the `syntax` string as a shell command.
    - `shell=True` enables shell expansion and interpretation, making the system vulnerable to command injection if `syntax` is not properly sanitized.
  * Security test case:
    1. Create a workload suite JSON file (e.g., `test_wkld.json`). The content of the workload suite is not relevant for this vulnerability, so a simple valid JSON will suffice.
    2. Execute `fiosynth` with the following command, replacing `/dev/sdc` with a valid device path on your system and `test_wkld.json` with the path to the created workload suite file, and `output_file` with desired output filename:
    ```bash
    fiosynth -d /dev/sdc -w test_wkld.json -f output_file -t "uname -a; id > /tmp/pwned"
    ```
    3. After the command executes, check the `/tmp/pwned` file.
    4. If the vulnerability is present, the `/tmp/pwned` file will contain the output of the `id` command, proving arbitrary command execution.
    5. Additionally, the output of `uname -a` and `date` will be present in the `health.log` file.
