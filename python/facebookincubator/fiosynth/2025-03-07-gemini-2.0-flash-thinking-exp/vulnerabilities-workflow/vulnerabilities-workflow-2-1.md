### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `-t` option

* Description:
    1. The `fiosynth` application accepts user input through the `-t` option, intended to specify a "Health Monitoring Tool Syntax".
    2. This input is passed to the `health_tools.py` script and executed by the `HealthTools.logger` function.
    3. The `HealthTools.logger` function in `fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py` uses `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)` to execute the provided syntax.
    4. The `shell=True` argument in `subprocess.Popen` allows for shell command injection.
    5. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by providing a malicious string to the `-t` option, which will be executed with the privileges of the `fiosynth` application.

* Impact:
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where `fiosynth` is running.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
    - If `fiosynth` is run with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`), the attacker can gain root access.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly executes the user-provided string without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The `-t` option input should be sanitized to remove or escape potentially malicious characters and commands.
    - Input validation: The input should be validated to ensure it conforms to the expected "Health Monitoring Tool Syntax" and prevent execution of arbitrary commands.
    - Avoid `shell=True`: The `subprocess.Popen` should be used with `shell=False` and the command and arguments should be passed as a list to prevent shell injection.
    - Principle of least privilege:  `fiosynth` should be run with the minimum privileges necessary to perform its function, reducing the impact if command injection is exploited.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `fiosynth` script.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to `fiosynth`, specifically the `-t` option.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Argument Parsing in `fiosynth.py`:**
       - The `set_attributes()` function in `/code/fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py` uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
       - It defines the `-t` option:
         ```python
         parser.add_argument(
             "-t",
             action="store",
             dest="health",
             type=str,
             help="(Optional) Enter Health Monitoring Tool Syntax (default = )",
             default="",
         )
         ```
       - The value provided to `-t` is stored in `args.health`.

    2. **Passing `-t` value to `health_tools.logger`:**
       - In the `runTest` function in `/code/fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py`, if `args.dryrun == "n"` and `dut_list[0].inLocalMode()` is true, the `runHealthMon` function is called:
         ```python
         if dut_list[0].inLocalMode():  # Health tools only works locally
             runHealthMon(dut_list[0].fname, args.health, args.getflash)
         ```
       - The `args.health` value (which is the `-t` option input) is passed as the `health` argument to `runHealthMon`.

    3. **`runHealthMon` function:**
       - The `runHealthMon` function is defined in `/code/fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py`:
         ```python
         def runHealthMon(fname, health="", flash=None):
             if health != "":
                 runHealthTool = health_tools.HealthTools()
                 runHealthTool.logger(health)
             if flash == "y":
                 filename = os.path.join(fname, "flashconfig.csv")
                 runGetFlashConfig = flash_config.GetFlashConfig()
                 config_as_json, tool = runGetFlashConfig.get_json()
                 runGetFlashConfig.json_to_csv(".", config_as_json, filename, tool)
         ```
       - It instantiates `health_tools.HealthTools` and calls `runHealthTool.logger(health)`. The `health` argument is directly passed to the `logger` function.

    4. **`HealthTools.logger` function in `health_tools.py`:**
       - The `logger` function in `/code/fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py` executes the provided `syntax` using `subprocess.Popen`:
         ```python
         class HealthTools:
             def logger(self, syntax):
                 FILENAME = "health.log"
                 file_ = open(FILENAME, "a")
                 subprocess.Popen("date", stdout=file_)
                 subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True) # Vulnerable line
                 file_.close()
         ```
       - `subprocess.Popen(syntax, stdout=file_, shell=True)`: This line is vulnerable to command injection because `shell=True` is used, and the `syntax` variable is directly derived from user input (`-t` option) without sanitization.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    fiosynth.py (main) --> fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py (runSuite) --> fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py (runCycles) --> fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py (runTest) --> fiosynth_lib/fiosynth.py (runHealthMon) --> fiosynth_lib/health_tools.py (HealthTools.logger) --> subprocess.Popen(syntax, shell=True)
                                                                                                                                     ^
                                                                                                                                     |
                                                                                                                                     -t option (user input)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Have `fiosynth` installed or be able to run `fiosynth.py` directly.
        - Have `fio` and `python3` installed.
        - Be in a Linux environment (as per `README.md` requirements).

    2. **Steps:**
        - Open a terminal.
        - Navigate to the `fiosynth` project directory.
        - Execute `fiosynth.py` with the `-t` option and a command injection payload. For example, to execute `whoami` command, use the following command:
          ```bash
          python3 fiosynth.py -d /dev/null -w PeakWklds -f test_command_injection -t "$(whoami > /tmp/fiosynth_whoami.txt)"
          ```
          Replace `/dev/null` with a valid device if required for the `-d` option, and `PeakWklds` with a valid workload suite for the `-w` option. `-f test_command_injection` sets the results filename. The `-t` option is set to `$(whoami > /tmp/fiosynth_whoami.txt)`, which will execute the `whoami` command and redirect the output to `/tmp/fiosynth_whoami.txt`.

    3. **Verification:**
        - After the `fiosynth` command completes, check if the file `/tmp/fiosynth_whoami.txt` exists.
        - If the file exists and contains the username of the user running `fiosynth`, then the command injection was successful.
        - You can check the content of the file using:
          ```bash
          cat /tmp/fiosynth_whoami.txt
          ```
        - For further testing, you can try more harmful commands, such as creating a reverse shell or deleting files (use with caution in a test environment). For example, to create a file named `INJECTED` in `/tmp`:
          ```bash
          python3 fiosynth.py -d /dev/null -w PeakWklds -f test_command_injection -t "touch /tmp/INJECTED"
          ```
          And verify file creation:
          ```bash
          ls /tmp/INJECTED
          ```

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can successfully inject and execute arbitrary commands through the `-t` option in `fiosynth`, confirming the command injection vulnerability.
