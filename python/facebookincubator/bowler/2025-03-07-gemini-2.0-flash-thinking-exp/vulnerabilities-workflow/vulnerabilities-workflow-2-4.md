All three vulnerabilities meet the inclusion criteria and do not fall under the exclusion criteria. Therefore, we will return the list as is in markdown format.

```markdown
- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via `bowler do` Command
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python code string.
    2. The attacker tricks a Bowler user into executing the `bowler do` command with the malicious code string as the query argument. For example, `bowler do "__import__('os').system('malicious command')"` or `bowler do "Query('.').modify('__import__(\\'os\\').system(\\'malicious command\\')').write()"`.
    3. The `bowler do` command in `bowler/main.py` uses `eval()` to execute the provided query string.
    4. The `eval()` function executes the malicious Python code string, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can gain full control over the user's system, steal sensitive information, modify files, or install malware.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code directly uses `eval()` on user-provided input without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    -  Avoid using `eval()` to execute user-provided code.
    -  If dynamic query execution is necessary, use a safer alternative like a restricted execution environment or a sandboxed interpreter, but for this case, simply removing `eval` is the best approach.
    -  Input validation and sanitization of the query string is insufficient and difficult to implement securely for `eval()`.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a Bowler user to execute the `bowler do` command with a malicious query string. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by distributing malicious refactoring rules that instruct the user to run a specific `bowler do` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/bowler/main.py`.
    2. Locate the `do` command function.
    3. Observe the line: `result = eval(code)  # noqa eval() - developer tool, hopefully they're not dumb`.
    4. The `eval(code)` function directly evaluates the `code` variable, which is derived from the user-provided `query` argument to the `bowler do` command.
    ```python
    @main.command()
    @click.option("-i", "--interactive", is_flag=True)
    @click.argument("query", required=False)
    @click.argument("paths", type=click.Path(exists=True), nargs=-1, required=False)
    def do(interactive: bool, query: str, paths: List[str]) -> None:
        """Execute a query or enter interactive mode."""
        # ...
        if not query or query == "-":
            # ... interactive mode ...
        else:
            code = compile(query, "<console>", "eval")
            result = eval(code)  # noqa eval() - developer tool, hopefully they're not dumb
            # ... process result ...
    ```
    5. This direct use of `eval()` allows execution of arbitrary Python code provided by the user through the `query` argument.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the Bowler project.
    2. Execute the following command: `bowler do "__import__('os').system('echo Vulnerability Found!')"`
    3. Observe that the command `echo Vulnerability Found!` is executed by the system. The output "Vulnerability Found!" will be printed in the terminal, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
    4. As a more impactful test, attempt to create a file: `bowler do "__import__('os').system('touch /tmp/bowler_vulnerability_test')"`
    5. Check if the file `/tmp/bowler_vulnerability_test` was created. If it exists, it confirms arbitrary command execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Code Execution via `bowler run` Command with Malicious Codemod
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python script (codemod) containing harmful code.
    2. The attacker tricks a Bowler user into executing the `bowler run` command with the path to the malicious script as the `codemod` argument. For example, `bowler run malicious_codemod.py`.
    3. The `bowler run` command in `bowler/main.py` imports and executes the provided script using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and `spec.loader.exec_module`.
    4. When the malicious script is executed, it performs actions defined by the attacker, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. Similar to the previous vulnerability, an attacker can gain full system control.
- Vulnerability Rank: High (While intended functionality to run scripts, the risk arises from running untrusted scripts, which is a common user mistake)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code imports and executes the script without any security checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    -  Clearly document the security risks of running untrusted codemod scripts.
    -  Implement warnings when `bowler run` is used, especially if the script is not from a trusted source.
    -  Consider adding options to run codemods in a more restricted environment, although this might be complex to implement effectively. Education and clear warnings are the most practical mitigations.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to distribute a malicious Python script and trick a Bowler user into downloading and executing it using `bowler run`. This can be achieved by hosting the script on a website, sending it via email, or including it in a seemingly benign package.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/bowler/main.py`.
    2. Locate the `run` command function.
    3. Observe the code block that imports and executes the codemod script:
    ```python
        path = Path(codemod)
        if path.exists():
            if path.is_dir():
                raise click.ClickException("running directories not supported")

            spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(  # type: ignore
                path.name, path
            )
            module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
            spec.loader.exec_module(module)  # type: ignore

        else:
            module = importlib.import_module(codemod)

        main = getattr(module, "main", None)
        if main is not None:
            main()
    ```
    4. This code directly executes the Python script specified by the `codemod` argument. There are no checks to validate the script's content or origin.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious Python script named `malicious_codemod.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    import os

    def main():
        os.system('echo Malicious Codemod Executed!')
        os.system('touch /tmp/malicious_bowler_codemod_test')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `malicious_codemod.py`.
    3. Execute the following command: `bowler run malicious_codemod.py`
    4. Observe that the command `echo Malicious Codemod Executed!` is printed in the terminal.
    5. Check if the file `/tmp/malicious_bowler_codemod_test` was created. If it exists, it confirms arbitrary command execution through a malicious codemod.

- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via String-based Filters and Modifiers
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious string containing Python code for a filter or modifier.
    2. The attacker tricks a Bowler user into using this malicious string in a `Query` definition, either directly in their code or by providing a configuration file or rule set that includes it. For example, using `.filter('__import__("os").system("malicious command") == 1')` or `.modify('__import__("os").system("malicious command")')`.
    3. When the Bowler query is executed, the `filter()` or `modify()` methods in `bowler/query.py` compile and `eval()` or `exec()` the provided string within the callback function.
    4. The `eval()` or `exec()` function executes the malicious Python code string during the refactoring process, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution, similar to the `bowler do` vulnerability.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The `filter()` and `modify()` methods directly use `eval()` and `exec()` without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    -  Completely remove the ability to use string-based filters and modifiers. Force users to provide Python functions instead.
    -  If string-based filters/modifiers are deemed absolutely necessary, explore safer alternatives to `eval()` and `exec()`, but these are generally not recommended for security-sensitive contexts. Input validation is again insufficient for `eval()` and `exec()`.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a Bowler user into using a malicious string in their Bowler query definition. This can be achieved by providing malicious code examples, distributing malicious refactoring rule sets, or compromising a user's development environment to inject malicious strings into their Bowler scripts.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/bowler/query.py`.
    2. Locate the `filter()` and `modify()` methods.
    3. Observe that if the `filter_callback` or `callback` argument is a string, it is compiled and `eval()` (for `filter`) or `exec()` (for `modify`).
    ```python
    def filter(self, filter_callback: Union[str, Filter]) -> "Query":
        if isinstance(filter_callback, str):
            code = compile(filter_callback, "<string>", "eval")

            def callback(node: Node, capture: Capture, filename: Filename) -> bool:
                return bool(eval(code))  # noqa: developer tool

        filter_callback = cast(Filter, filter_callback)
        self.current.filters.append(filter_callback)
        return self

    def modify(self, callback: Union[str, Callback]) -> "Query":
        if isinstance(callback, str):
            code = compile(callback, "<string>", "exec")

            def callback(node: Node, capture: Capture, filename: Filename) -> None:
                exec(code)

        callback = cast(Callback, callback)
        self.current.callbacks.append(callback)
        return self
    ```
    4. The `eval(code)` in `filter()` and `exec(code)` in `modify()` directly execute code derived from user-provided strings.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Python file, e.g., `test_vulnerability_filter_modifier.py`, with the following content:
    ```python
    from bowler import Query

    def main():
        query = (
            Query('.')
            .select_function('foo')
            .filter('__import__("os").system("echo Filter Vulnerability Found!") == 1')
            .modify('__import__("os").system("touch /tmp/bowler_filter_vulnerability_test")')
            .write()
        )
        query.execute()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    2. Open a terminal and execute the script: `python test_vulnerability_filter_modifier.py`
    3. Observe that "Filter Vulnerability Found!" is printed in the terminal.
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/bowler_filter_vulnerability_test` was created. If it exists, it confirms arbitrary command execution through a malicious string-based filter.
    5. Repeat the test by changing `.filter()` to `.modify()` and adjusting the string payload and output checks to verify the vulnerability in string-based modifiers as well. For example, change the script to use `.modify('__import__("os").system("echo Modifier Vulnerability Found!")')` and check for "Modifier Vulnerability Found!" in the output.
