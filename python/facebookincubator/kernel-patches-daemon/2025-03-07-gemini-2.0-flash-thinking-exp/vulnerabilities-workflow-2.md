### Combined Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Patch Application via `git am` leading to Remote Code Execution

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious patch series. This series could contain code designed to execute arbitrary commands on the system or introduce backdoors into the repository.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious patch series into the monitored mailing list, ensuring it is picked up by the Patchwork system.
    3. The Kernel Patches Daemon monitors the Patchwork system for new patch series.
    4. Upon detecting the malicious patch series, the daemon automatically fetches the patches from the Patchwork system.
    5. The daemon applies these patches to a local Git repository using `git am` or a similar patch application mechanism, without performing adequate validation or sanitization of the patch content.
    6. If the malicious patch is crafted to exploit a vulnerability during the patch application process or contains executable code, it will be executed with the privileges of the daemon user.
    7. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running the daemon or corruption of the Git repository managed by the daemon.
    Specifically, in `kernel_patches_daemon/branch_worker.py`, the `checkout_and_patch` function is called to apply the patch series. Inside `checkout_and_patch`, the `apply_push_comment` function is called. `apply_push_comment` calls `try_apply_mailbox_series`. `try_apply_mailbox_series` executes `git am --3way` command to apply the patch from the fetched mbox file. The `git am` command is known to be vulnerable to command injection through crafted patch files, specifically via filenames or patch content processed by the command. An attacker can craft a patch where filenames or content contain shell commands. When `git am` processes this patch, it can execute these embedded shell commands, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the machine running `kpd`.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Kernel Patches Daemon. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    - Repository Corruption: Malicious patches could introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code into the Git repository that the daemon manages. This could compromise the integrity and security of the kernel source code.
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server running the `kpd` daemon. This could lead to full control of the `kpd` server, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        - Steal sensitive information, such as GitHub tokens or repository credentials.
        - Modify the kernel Git repository, injecting backdoors or malicious code into the kernel source.
        - Disrupt the operation of the `kpd` service and potentially the CI pipeline.
        - Pivot to other systems accessible from the `kpd` server.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently implemented mitigations: None. The project description explicitly identifies this as a threat. There is no input validation or sanitization of patch content implemented in the provided code. There are no mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent command injection via `git am`. The code directly uses `git am --3way` to apply patches without any sanitization or security checks on the patch content or filenames.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Patch Content Validation: Implement robust validation of patch content before application. This could include:
        - Static analysis of patches to detect potentially malicious code patterns.
        - Checking for unexpected file modifications or additions outside of allowed directories.
        - Signature verification of patches if the Patchwork system supports it.
    - Sandboxed Patch Application: Apply patches in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain the impact of a successful exploit. Use containers or virtual machines to isolate the patch application process.
    - Manual Review Step: Introduce a manual review step before automatically applying patches. Require human approval for patch series from untrusted sources or those that trigger security concerns during automated validation.
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize patch files before applying them using `git am`. This could involve parsing the patch file to identify and remove or escape potentially malicious filenames or content. However, robust sanitization of patch files to prevent all injection attempts is complex and error-prone.
    - **Secure Patch Application Method:** Instead of relying on `git am`, consider using a safer method for applying patches programmatically, such as parsing the patch and applying changes directly through GitPython library APIs, avoiding shell command execution entirely.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the `kpd` daemon in a sandboxed environment or container with restricted privileges to limit the impact of a successful RCE. This could involve using Docker/containerization with security profiles, seccomp, or similar technologies.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
    - Principle of least privilege: Run the `kpd` process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection exploit.

* Preconditions:
    - The Kernel Patches Daemon is running and configured to monitor a Patchwork system that is accessible to attackers (e.g., connected to a public mailing list).
    - An attacker has the ability to inject content into the monitored mailing list that will be processed by the Patchwork system and subsequently by the Kernel Patches Daemon.
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit patches to the Patchwork system that `kpd` monitors. This is a likely precondition as Patchwork is designed for patch submission.
    - The `kpd` daemon must be configured to process patches from the Patchwork project to which the malicious patch is submitted.
    - The `kpd` daemon must execute the vulnerable code path, specifically calling `git am` to apply the malicious patch.

* Source code analysis:
    - The `kernel_patches_daemon/branch_worker.py` file contains the `try_apply_mailbox_series` function, which is responsible for applying patches.
    - ```python
      async def try_apply_mailbox_series(
          self, branch_name: str, series: Series
      ) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[Exception], Optional[Any]]:
          ...
          patch_content = await series.get_patch_binary_content()
          with temporary_patch_file(patch_content) as tmp_patch_file:
              try:
                  self.repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file)
              except git.exc.GitCommandError as e:
                  ...
      ```
    - This code snippet shows that the daemon fetches the raw patch content using `series.get_patch_binary_content()` from the Patchwork system and directly applies it using `self.repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file)`.
    - `git am` command is used to apply patches in mail format. This command, by design, will execute any commands embedded within the mail if the mail is crafted maliciously, especially within the commit message or patch content itself if it exploits `git am` vulnerabilities.
    - There is no code in `try_apply_mailbox_series` or related functions that validates or sanitizes the `patch_content` before applying it using `git am`. The patch is directly passed to the `git am` command without any checks.
    - The `patchwork.py` file is responsible for fetching patch content but does not perform any validation.
    - ```python
      class Series:
          ...
          async def get_patch_binary_content(self) -> bytes:
              content = await self.pw_client.get_blob(self.mbox)
              ...
              return content
      ```
    - The `Patchwork.get_blob` function simply fetches the content from the provided URL without any content inspection.
    - ```python
      class Patchwork:
          ...
          async def get_blob(self, url: AnyStr) -> bytes:
              resp = await self.__get(url, allow_redirects=True)
              return await resp.read()
      ```
    - The lack of validation in both `branch_worker.py` and `patchwork.py` confirms the "Unsafe Patch Application" vulnerability.
    - **File:** `/code/kernel_patches_daemon/branch_worker.py`
    - **Function:** `try_apply_mailbox_series(self, branch_name: str, series: Series)`
    - **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    async def try_apply_mailbox_series(
        self, branch_name: str, series: Series
    ) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[Exception], Optional[Any]]:
        ...
        patch_content = await series.get_patch_binary_content()
        with temporary_patch_file(patch_content) as tmp_patch_file:
            try:
                self.repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file) # Vulnerable line
            except git.exc.GitCommandError as e:
                ...
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file)` line directly executes the `git am` command, passing the patch content from `tmp_patch_file` as input. If the patch content is maliciously crafted to include shell commands within filenames, `git am` will interpret and execute these commands during patch application. The `--3way` option does not mitigate this command injection vulnerability; it only handles merge conflicts.

* Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Deploy a test instance of the Kernel Patches Daemon, configured to monitor a mock Patchwork system.
        - Create a mock Patchwork system that will serve malicious patches.
        - Set up a mock Git repository that the daemon will manage.
    2. Malicious Patch Creation:
        - Craft a malicious patch series in email format. The patch should include:
            - A benign code change (e.g., adding a comment to a file).
            - A malicious payload embedded in the commit message that will execute a command when `git am` is run. For example, the commit message could contain:
              ```
              From: Attacker <attacker@example.com>

    3. Patch Injection:
        - Configure the mock Patchwork system to serve the `malicious.patch` content when the daemon requests the patch series. This might involve creating a mock API endpoint that returns the content of `malicious.patch` in response to the daemon's request for the patch series Mbox URL.
    4. Daemon Processing:
        - Trigger the daemon to process new patch series (e.g., by adding the malicious series to the mock Patchwork system).
        - Monitor the daemon's logs to confirm it is processing the malicious series.
    5. Verification:
        - Check for the execution of the malicious payload. Verify if the file `/tmp/malicious_output` was created on the server running the daemon.
    6. Expected Result:
        - The file `/tmp/malicious_output` should be created, indicating successful arbitrary code execution due to the unsafe patch application vulnerability.
    Or alternatively using malicious filename:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a test Patchwork instance (or use a mock).
        - Configure a `kpd` instance to monitor this test Patchwork instance and a test Git repository.
        - Ensure the `kpd` instance is running and processing patches.
    2. **Craft Malicious Patch:**
        - Create a malicious patch file (`malicious.patch`) with a crafted filename to inject a command. For example, create a file named `"; touch /tmp/pwned #"` and add some content to it. The patch should look something like this:
        ```diff
        --- a/file1.txt
        +++ b/file1.txt

        - Convert this diff to mbox format, which is the input for `git am`. You can use tools like `git format-patch -o - --mbox --no-binary <commit>` to create mbox format patches from a git commit, and then manually edit the resulting patch file to include the malicious filename.
    3. **Submit Malicious Patch:**
        - Submit the `malicious.patch` (in mbox format) to the test Patchwork instance as a new patch series.
    4. **Trigger KPD Processing:**
        - Wait for the `kpd` daemon to fetch and process the new patch series from Patchwork. This usually happens automatically based on the `kpd`'s polling interval.
    5. **Verify RCE:**
        - Check if the command injected in the malicious patch was executed on the `kpd` server. In this test case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created on the `kpd` server.
    6. **Expected Result:**
        - If the vulnerability is present, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created on the `kpd` server, indicating successful Remote Code Execution. The `kpd` daemon will likely continue to operate, but the system is now compromised.

* Vulnerability Name: GitHub Workflow Command Injection

* Description:
  - An attacker crafts a malicious kernel patch. This patch contains specially crafted content designed to exploit command injection vulnerabilities in GitHub Workflows.
  - The attacker submits this malicious patch to the Patchwork system.
  - The Kernel Patches Daemon (`kpd`) detects the new patch series from Patchwork.
  - `kpd` applies the patches to a local Git repository.
  - `kpd` automatically creates a pull request to the target GitHub repository, incorporating the malicious patch.
  - The creation of this pull request triggers a GitHub Workflow in the target repository. This workflow's definition is sourced from the `ci_repo` as configured in `kpd.conf.template`.
  - A vulnerability exists within the GitHub Workflow definition (located in `.github/workflows` and copied from `ci_repo`). This vulnerability arises from insecurely processing patch content—such as the patch title, description, filenames, or diff content—within workflow commands, for example, in `run` steps.
  - When the workflow executes, the malicious patch content is processed by the vulnerable workflow command, leading to the execution of attacker-injected commands within the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
  - Consequently, the attacker achieves arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions CI environment.

* Impact:
  - Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions CI pipeline. This can lead to severe security breaches, including:
    - Stealing sensitive secrets and credentials stored within GitHub Actions environments.
    - Unauthorized modification of the source code repository.
    - Deployment of backdoored or malicious artifacts.
    - Tampering with software build, test, and release processes, compromising the integrity of the software supply chain.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The provided project files for `kpd` do not include mitigations for this vulnerability. The vulnerability is not within the `kpd` application itself, but rather in the potentially vulnerable GitHub Workflow definitions that are external to `kpd`'s codebase and are intended to be provided by the user via `ci_repo`. `kpd`'s role is to trigger these workflows, not to secure them.

* Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization within GitHub Workflow definitions: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all patch-derived content (title, description, filenames, diff) before using it in workflow commands, especially in `run` steps.
  - Secure GitHub Workflow coding practices: Adopt secure coding practices for workflow definitions to prevent command injection. This includes using parameterized commands, avoiding direct shell execution when possible, and employing linters and security scanners specifically designed for workflow definitions.
  - Review and hardening of CI Workflow definitions: Conduct a thorough security review and implement hardening measures for all GitHub Workflow definitions in the `ci_repo`. Focus on eliminating command injection vulnerabilities and ensuring secure handling of external inputs, particularly patch content.

* Preconditions:
  - A vulnerable GitHub Workflow definition must be present in the `ci_repo` and configured for use by `kpd`, ensuring it's copied to the target repository. This workflow must contain a command injection vulnerability related to processing patch content.
  - The attacker must have the ability to submit patches to the Patchwork system that is monitored by the `kpd` instance.

* Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided Python code for `kpd` does not exhibit vulnerabilities that directly lead to command injection within the `kpd` application itself. `kpd`'s code primarily focuses on:
    - Monitoring the Patchwork system for new patch series.
    - Applying patches to a local Git repository using `git am`.
    - Creating pull requests on GitHub using the PyGithub library.
    - Updating Patchwork status checks based on GitHub Workflow results.
  - The vulnerability is not in `kpd`'s code but in the *configuration* and *intended usage* of `kpd` to trigger potentially vulnerable GitHub Workflows. The risk arises from the assumption that the GitHub Workflow definitions, sourced from `ci_repo`, might contain command injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities would be triggered when `kpd`-created pull requests cause GitHub Actions to execute these workflows, and the workflows insecurely process patch data.

* Security Test Case:
  - Setup:
    - Ensure you can submit patches to the Patchwork instance monitored by `kpd`.
    - Configure `kpd` to use a `ci_repo` containing a deliberately vulnerable GitHub Workflow. This workflow should be designed to trigger on `pull_request` events and contain a command injection vulnerability. For example, the workflow could have a `run` step that echoes the pull request title directly into a shell command:
      ```yaml
      name: Vulnerable Workflow
      on:
        pull_request:
          types: [opened]
      jobs:
        command_injection:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Vulnerable Step
              run: echo "Pull Request Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" # INSECURE - vulnerable to command injection
      ```
  - Craft Malicious Patch:
    - Create a kernel patch with a title crafted to inject commands. For instance:
      ```
      From: Attacker <attacker@example.com>
      Date: Tue, 6 Jun 2024 10:00:00 +0000
      Subject: [Vulnerability] Malicious patch title; $(whoami > /tmp/kpd_pwned)

      This patch contains a malicious title to test for command injection.

      ```
  - Submit Patch:
    - Submit this crafted patch to the Patchwork system.
  - Trigger Workflow:
    - Allow `kpd` to process the patch. It will create a pull request on GitHub, which in turn will trigger the vulnerable GitHub Workflow.
  - Verify Exploit:
    - Examine the logs of the GitHub Workflow run triggered by your pull request. If the command injection is successful, you should observe the execution of the injected command. In this test case, check for the output of the `whoami` command within the workflow logs or, if possible, verify the creation of the `/tmp/kpd_pwned` file in the CI environment (depending on the workflow's permissions and logging capabilities). A simpler verification might be to just observe the output of the injected command being echoed if the vulnerable workflow uses a command like `echo`.
