- **Vulnerability name:** Unsafe Patch Application
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious patch series. This series could contain code designed to execute arbitrary commands on the system or introduce backdoors into the repository.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious patch series into the monitored mailing list, ensuring it is picked up by the Patchwork system.
    3. The Kernel Patches Daemon monitors the Patchwork system for new patch series.
    4. Upon detecting the malicious patch series, the daemon automatically fetches the patches from the Patchwork system.
    5. The daemon applies these patches to a local Git repository using `git am` or a similar patch application mechanism, without performing adequate validation or sanitization of the patch content.
    6. If the malicious patch is crafted to exploit a vulnerability during the patch application process or contains executable code, it will be executed with the privileges of the daemon user.
    7. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running the daemon or corruption of the Git repository managed by the daemon.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Kernel Patches Daemon. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    - Repository Corruption: Malicious patches could introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code into the Git repository that the daemon manages. This could compromise the integrity and security of the kernel source code.
- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The project description explicitly identifies this as a threat. There is no input validation or sanitization of patch content implemented in the provided code.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Patch Content Validation: Implement robust validation of patch content before application. This could include:
        - Static analysis of patches to detect potentially malicious code patterns.
        - Checking for unexpected file modifications or additions outside of allowed directories.
        - Signature verification of patches if the Patchwork system supports it.
    - Sandboxed Patch Application: Apply patches in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain the impact of a successful exploit. Use containers or virtual machines to isolate the patch application process.
    - Manual Review Step: Introduce a manual review step before automatically applying patches. Require human approval for patch series from untrusted sources or those that trigger security concerns during automated validation.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The Kernel Patches Daemon is running and configured to monitor a Patchwork system that is accessible to attackers (e.g., connected to a public mailing list).
    - An attacker has the ability to inject content into the monitored mailing list that will be processed by the Patchwork system and subsequently by the Kernel Patches Daemon.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - The `kernel_patches_daemon/branch_worker.py` file contains the `try_apply_mailbox_series` function, which is responsible for applying patches.
    - ```python
      async def try_apply_mailbox_series(
          self, branch_name: str, series: Series
      ) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[Exception], Optional[Any]]:
          ...
          patch_content = await series.get_patch_binary_content()
          with temporary_patch_file(patch_content) as tmp_patch_file:
              try:
                  self.repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file)
              except git.exc.GitCommandError as e:
                  ...
      ```
    - This code snippet shows that the daemon fetches the raw patch content using `series.get_patch_binary_content()` from the Patchwork system and directly applies it using `self.repo_local.git.am("--3way", istream=tmp_patch_file)`.
    - `git am` command is used to apply patches in mail format. This command, by design, will execute any commands embedded within the mail if the mail is crafted maliciously, especially within the commit message or patch content itself if it exploits `git am` vulnerabilities.
    - There is no code in `try_apply_mailbox_series` or related functions that validates or sanitizes the `patch_content` before applying it using `git am`. The patch is directly passed to the `git am` command without any checks.
    - The `patchwork.py` file is responsible for fetching patch content but does not perform any validation.
    - ```python
      class Series:
          ...
          async def get_patch_binary_content(self) -> bytes:
              content = await self.pw_client.get_blob(self.mbox)
              ...
              return content
      ```
    - The `Patchwork.get_blob` function simply fetches the content from the provided URL without any content inspection.
    - ```python
      class Patchwork:
          ...
          async def get_blob(self, url: AnyStr) -> bytes:
              resp = await self.__get(url, allow_redirects=True)
              return await resp.read()
      ```
    - The lack of validation in both `branch_worker.py` and `patchwork.py` confirms the "Unsafe Patch Application" vulnerability.
- **Security test case:**
    1. Setup:
        - Deploy a test instance of the Kernel Patches Daemon, configured to monitor a mock Patchwork system.
        - Create a mock Patchwork system that will serve malicious patches.
        - Set up a mock Git repository that the daemon will manage.
    2. Malicious Patch Creation:
        - Craft a malicious patch series in email format. The patch should include:
            - A benign code change (e.g., adding a comment to a file).
            - A malicious payload embedded in the commit message that will execute a command when `git am` is run. For example, the commit message could contain:
              ```

    3. Patch Injection:
        - Configure the mock Patchwork system to serve the `malicious.patch` content when the daemon requests the patch series. This might involve creating a mock API endpoint that returns the content of `malicious.patch` in response to the daemon's request for the patch series Mbox URL.
    4. Daemon Processing:
        - Trigger the daemon to process new patch series (e.g., by adding the malicious series to the mock Patchwork system).
        - Monitor the daemon's logs to confirm it is processing the malicious series.
    5. Verification:
        - Check for the execution of the malicious payload. Verify if the file `/tmp/malicious_output` was created on the server running the daemon.
    6. Expected Result:
        - The file `/tmp/malicious_output` should be created, indicating successful arbitrary code execution due to the unsafe patch application vulnerability.
