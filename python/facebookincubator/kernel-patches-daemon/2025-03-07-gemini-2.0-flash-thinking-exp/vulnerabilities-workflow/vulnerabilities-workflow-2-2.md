- Vulnerability Name: GitHub Workflow Command Injection
- Description:
  - An attacker crafts a malicious kernel patch. This patch contains specially crafted content designed to exploit command injection vulnerabilities in GitHub Workflows.
  - The attacker submits this malicious patch to the Patchwork system.
  - The Kernel Patches Daemon (`kpd`) detects the new patch series from Patchwork.
  - `kpd` applies the patches to a local Git repository.
  - `kpd` automatically creates a pull request to the target GitHub repository, incorporating the malicious patch.
  - The creation of this pull request triggers a GitHub Workflow in the target repository. This workflow's definition is sourced from the `ci_repo` as configured in `kpd.conf.template`.
  - A vulnerability exists within the GitHub Workflow definition (located in `.github/workflows` and copied from `ci_repo`). This vulnerability arises from insecurely processing patch content—such as the patch title, description, filenames, or diff content—within workflow commands, for example, in `run` steps.
  - When the workflow executes, the malicious patch content is processed by the vulnerable workflow command, leading to the execution of attacker-injected commands within the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
  - Consequently, the attacker achieves arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions CI environment.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions CI pipeline. This can lead to severe security breaches, including:
    - Stealing sensitive secrets and credentials stored within GitHub Actions environments.
    - Unauthorized modification of the source code repository.
    - Deployment of backdoored or malicious artifacts.
    - Tampering with software build, test, and release processes, compromising the integrity of the software supply chain.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The provided project files for `kpd` do not include mitigations for this vulnerability. The vulnerability is not within the `kpd` application itself, but rather in the potentially vulnerable GitHub Workflow definitions that are external to `kpd`'s codebase and are intended to be provided by the user via `ci_repo`. `kpd`'s role is to trigger these workflows, not to secure them.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization within GitHub Workflow definitions: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all patch-derived content (title, description, filenames, diff) before using it in workflow commands, especially in `run` steps.
  - Secure GitHub Workflow coding practices: Adopt secure coding practices for workflow definitions to prevent command injection. This includes using parameterized commands, avoiding direct shell execution when possible, and employing linters and security scanners specifically designed for workflow definitions.
  - Review and hardening of CI Workflow definitions: Conduct a thorough security review and implement hardening measures for all GitHub Workflow definitions in the `ci_repo`. Focus on eliminating command injection vulnerabilities and ensuring secure handling of external inputs, particularly patch content.
- Preconditions:
  - A vulnerable GitHub Workflow definition must be present in the `ci_repo` and configured for use by `kpd`, ensuring it's copied to the target repository. This workflow must contain a command injection vulnerability related to processing patch content.
  - The attacker must have the ability to submit patches to the Patchwork system that is monitored by the `kpd` instance.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided Python code for `kpd` does not exhibit vulnerabilities that directly lead to command injection within the `kpd` application itself. `kpd`'s code primarily focuses on:
    - Monitoring the Patchwork system for new patch series.
    - Applying patches to a local Git repository using `git am`.
    - Creating pull requests on GitHub using the PyGithub library.
    - Updating Patchwork status checks based on GitHub Workflow results.
  - The vulnerability is not in `kpd`'s code but in the *configuration* and *intended usage* of `kpd` to trigger potentially vulnerable GitHub Workflows. The risk arises from the assumption that the GitHub Workflow definitions, sourced from `ci_repo`, might contain command injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities would be triggered when `kpd`-created pull requests cause GitHub Actions to execute these workflows, and the workflows insecurely process patch data.
- Security Test Case:
  - Setup:
    - Ensure you can submit patches to the Patchwork instance monitored by `kpd`.
    - Configure `kpd` to use a `ci_repo` containing a deliberately vulnerable GitHub Workflow. This workflow should be designed to trigger on `pull_request` events and contain a command injection vulnerability. For example, the workflow could have a `run` step that echoes the pull request title directly into a shell command:
      ```yaml
      name: Vulnerable Workflow
      on:
        pull_request:
          types: [opened]
      jobs:
        command_injection:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Vulnerable Step
              run: echo "Pull Request Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" # INSECURE - vulnerable to command injection
      ```
  - Craft Malicious Patch:
    - Create a kernel patch with a title crafted to inject commands. For instance:
      ```
      From: Attacker <attacker@example.com>
      Date: Tue, 6 Jun 2024 10:00:00 +0000
      Subject: [Vulnerability] Malicious patch title; $(whoami > /tmp/kpd_pwned)

      This patch contains a malicious title to test for command injection.

      ---
      diff --git a/dummy b/dummy
      new file mode 100644
      index 0000000..e69de29
      ```
  - Submit Patch:
    - Submit this crafted patch to the Patchwork system.
  - Trigger Workflow:
    - Allow `kpd` to process the patch. It will create a pull request on GitHub, which in turn will trigger the vulnerable GitHub Workflow.
  - Verify Exploit:
    - Examine the logs of the GitHub Workflow run triggered by your pull request. If the command injection is successful, you should observe the execution of the injected command. In this test case, check for the output of the `whoami` command within the workflow logs or, if possible, verify the creation of the `/tmp/kpd_pwned` file in the CI environment (depending on the workflow's permissions and logging capabilities). A simpler verification might be to just observe the output of the injected command being echoed if the vulnerable workflow uses a command like `echo`.
