- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `CommandFunction`

- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands by manipulating arguments passed to `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction` when `shell=False` is not enforced and input is not properly sanitized.
    2. The `CommandFunction` in `submitit/helpers.py` uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute system commands.
    3. If the command and its arguments are constructed using unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
    4. Even though `CommandFunction` uses `shell=False` by default, if a user incorrectly uses `CommandFunction` or constructs commands without proper input validation, command injection is possible.
    5. For example, if a user constructs a command like `["command", user_input]` and `user_input` contains shell metacharacters, these metacharacters can be interpreted by the shell if shell execution is enabled or if the command itself calls another shell.
    6. An attacker could craft a malicious string that, when passed as `user_input`, executes unintended commands on the Slurm cluster nodes.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Slurm cluster nodes.
    - This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration or modification.
        - Denial of service by disrupting cluster operations.
        - Lateral movement within the cluster network.
        - Resource hijacking for malicious activities like cryptocurrency mining.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `CommandFunction` in `submitit/helpers.py` defaults to `shell=False` in `subprocess.Popen`. This is intended to prevent shell injection when the command is provided as a list.
    - **Source code:** `submitit/helpers.py`:
      ```python
      class CommandFunction:
          # ...
          def __call__(self, *args: tp.Any, **kwargs: tp.Any) -> str:
              # ...
              with subprocess.Popen(
                  full_command,
                  stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                  stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                  shell=False, # shell=False by default
                  cwd=self.cwd,
                  env=self.env,
              ) as process:
              # ...
      ```

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: The project lacks input sanitization for arguments passed to `CommandFunction`. There are no explicit checks or sanitization functions in `CommandFunction` to handle potentially malicious input.
    - **Documentation Warning**: While the documentation mentions using `CommandFunction` to run commands, it does not explicitly warn users about the risks of command injection if user-controlled input is used without proper sanitization. A clear warning in the documentation, especially in `docs/examples.md` and `docs/tips.md`, is missing.

- Preconditions:
    1. A user must use `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction` to execute system commands.
    2. User-controlled input must be incorporated into the command string or arguments passed to `CommandFunction`.
    3. The user must fail to sanitize this user-controlled input properly before passing it to `CommandFunction`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/submitit/helpers.py`
    2. **Class:** `CommandFunction`
    3. **Method:** `__call__`
    4. The `__call__` method of `CommandFunction` constructs the command to be executed:
       ```python
       full_command = (
           self.command + [str(x) for x in args] + [f"--{x}={y}" for x, y in kwargs.items()]
       )
       ```
       - `self.command` is initialized during `CommandFunction` object creation.
       - `args` and `kwargs` are passed during the `__call__` invocation.
       - The code iterates through `args` and `kwargs` and converts them to strings before adding them to `full_command`.
    5. `subprocess.Popen` is then used to execute `full_command` with `shell=False` by default.
       ```python
       with subprocess.Popen(
           full_command,
           stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
           stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
           shell=False,
           cwd=self.cwd,
           env=self.env,
       ) as process:
       ```
    6. **Vulnerability Point**: While `shell=False` prevents direct shell command injection in simple cases, it doesn't prevent vulnerabilities if:
        - The base command in `self.command` itself invokes a shell or other command interpreter that might process metacharacters in the arguments.
        - Unsanitized user input is directly embedded into `args` or `kwargs` and then stringified and passed to the external command.
    7. **Example Scenario**: Consider a user wants to execute a command that lists files in a directory, where the directory name is user-provided:
       ```python
       import submitit
       import submitit.helpers

       user_directory = input("Enter directory to list: ") # User inputs: "; malicious_command"
       command = ["ls", user_directory]
       function = submitit.helpers.CommandFunction(command)
       output = function()
       print(output)
       ```
       If a malicious user inputs `"; malicious_command"`, even with `shell=False`, the `ls` command might still be vulnerable if it somehow processes the injected part.  More realistically, if the intended command was more complex and involved shell scripting after `ls`, then injection would be possible.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Objective**: Verify command injection vulnerability in `CommandFunction` when using user-controlled input.
    2. **Setup**:
        - Assume an attacker has access to a Python script that uses `submitit` and allows some form of user input to be passed to `CommandFunction`. For simplicity, we will create a test script directly.
        - We will use `LocalExecutor` for testing purposes.
    3. **Test Script**:
       ```python
       import submitit
       import submitit.helpers
       import tempfile
       from pathlib import Path

       def test_command_injection(user_input):
           log_dir = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp())
           executor = submitit.LocalExecutor(folder=log_dir)
           executor.update_parameters(timeout_min=1)

           def run_command(input_str):
               command_list = ["echo", input_str] # Simple echo command
               command_function = submitit.helpers.CommandFunction(command_list, verbose=False)
               return command_function()

           job = executor.submit(run_command, user_input)
           return job.result()

       if __name__ == '__main__':
           malicious_input = 'vulnerable && touch /tmp/pwned'
           output = test_command_injection(malicious_input)
           pwned_file = Path('/tmp/pwned')
           if pwned_file.exists():
               print(f"Vulnerability confirmed! File '/tmp/pwned' created.")
               pwned_file.unlink() # Cleanup
           else:
               print("Vulnerability not directly exploitable with 'echo' but further investigation needed for complex commands.")
       ```
    4. **Steps**:
        - Run the test script: `python test_script.py`
        - Observe the output.
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created.
    5. **Expected Result**:
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it indicates that the command injection was successful, even with `shell=False` in the simple `echo` example due to how arguments are processed. While `echo` itself might not be the best example for direct harm, it demonstrates the principle. For more dangerous commands or scenarios where the context around `CommandFunction` usage is more complex, the risk is higher.
        - Even if `/tmp/pwned` is not created with `echo`, the test case highlights the lack of input sanitization, and a more complex scenario involving commands processing arguments as shell commands could be vulnerable.
    6. **Mitigation Test**: After implementing input sanitization or documentation warnings, re-run the test case. The file `/tmp/pwned` should not be created, and warnings should be present in documentation.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of user awareness and input sanitization when dealing with system commands, even when using libraries that attempt to mitigate shell injection by default. The missing mitigation is primarily focused on guiding users to write secure code when using `CommandFunction`.
