- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `CommandFunction`

- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious shell commands by controlling the input to the `CommandFunction`.
    2. The `CommandFunction` in `submitit.helpers` is designed to execute shell commands.
    3. The `__call__` method of `CommandFunction` constructs a command list by combining the initial command (`self.command`) with positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
    4. Specifically, arguments are appended to the command using string conversion and formatting, without proper sanitization or escaping for shell execution.
    5. If an attacker can influence the initial `command` list or provide malicious arguments through `*args` or `**kwargs` when creating or calling `CommandFunction`, they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
    6. When `executor.submit()` is used with a `CommandFunction` instance, this command is executed on the Slurm cluster.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Slurm cluster nodes where the job is executed.
    - This can lead to:
        - Unauthorized access to data and resources on the cluster.
        - Modification or deletion of files.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Lateral movement within the cluster environment.
        - Denial of service by disrupting cluster operations.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: The code does not implement any input sanitization or validation for `CommandFunction` arguments. The `CommandFunction` in `submitit/core/utils.py` directly concatenates user-provided input into shell commands without any security measures.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input sanitization for all arguments passed to `CommandFunction`. This should involve escaping shell metacharacters or using parameterized commands to prevent injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  Ensure that jobs executed by `submitit` run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of command injection. However, this is a general security measure and not a direct mitigation for this vulnerability.
    - **Security Audits**: Regularly conduct security audits of the `submitit` library, especially focusing on code paths that involve external command execution and user input handling.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must use `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction` to execute shell commands.
    2. An attacker must be able to influence the arguments passed to `CommandFunction` either during its instantiation or when it's called. This could happen if the command or arguments are derived from user-controlled data, configuration files, or external sources without proper validation.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/submitit/core/utils.py`
    2. Class: `CommandFunction`
    3. Method: `__call__(self, *args: tp.Any, **kwargs: tp.Any) -> str`
    4. Code snippet:
        ```python
        class CommandFunction:
            ...
            def __call__(self, *args: tp.Any, **kwargs: tp.Any) -> str:
                """Call the cammand line with addidional arguments
                The keyword arguments will be sent as --{key}={val}
                The logs bufferized. They will be printed if the job fails, or sent as output of the function
                Errors are provided with the internal stderr.
                """
                full_command = (
                    self.command + [str(x) for x in args] + [f"--{x}={y}" for x, y in kwargs.items()]
                )  # TODO bad parsing
                if self.verbose:
                    print(f"The following command is sent: \"{' '.join(full_command)}\"")
                with subprocess.Popen(
                    full_command,
                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                    shell=False, # shell=False is used, but input is not sanitized
                    cwd=self.cwd,
                    env=self.env,
                ) as process:
                    ...
        ```
    5. **Vulnerability Point**: The `full_command` is constructed by directly concatenating strings without any sanitization. Specifically, the lines:
        ```python
        full_command = (
            self.command + [str(x) for x in args] + [f"--{x}={y}" for x, y in kwargs.items()]
        )
        ```
        take `self.command` (which could be partially or fully user-controlled) and arguments `*args`, `**kwargs` and converts them to strings and joins them into a list which is then passed to `subprocess.Popen`. Even though `shell=False` is used, if `self.command` or arguments contain shell-executable code, it will be executed.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Assume an attacker has a way to influence the `command` argument of `CommandFunction` when it's used within a `submitit` job submission. For example, imagine a scenario where the base command is read from a configuration file that an attacker can modify, or if part of the command is constructed based on user-provided input to a web service that uses `submitit` in the backend.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection**: The attacker crafts a malicious command payload. For instance, they set the command to be `['/bin/sh', '-c', 'malicious_command']` where `malicious_command` is the injected payload. A simple payload to test would be creating a file in `/tmp`. Let's use `touch /tmp/pwned`.
    3. **Exploit Code**:
        ```python
        import submitit
        import os

        def exploit():
            command_injection = submitit.helpers.CommandFunction(['/bin/sh', '-c', 'touch /tmp/pwned'])
            return command_injection()

        executor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder="log_exploit")
        executor.update_parameters(timeout_min=1, slurm_partition="dev") # Adjust partition if needed
        job = executor.submit(exploit)
        job.result() # Wait for job completion

        # Check if the file '/tmp/pwned' exists. If it does, the command injection was successful.
        file_created = os.path.exists('/tmp/pwned')
        print(f"File '/tmp/pwned' created: {file_created}")
        assert file_created, "Exploit failed, file not created."

        ```
    4. **Execution**: Run the python script above in an environment where `submitit` is installed and configured to submit jobs (e.g., a Slurm cluster or using local executor for testing).
    5. **Verification**: After the job completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system where the job was executed (in case of local executor, it's the local machine; in case of Slurm, it's a Slurm node). If the file exists, it confirms that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed, proving the command injection vulnerability. The assertion in the test case will confirm successful exploitation.

This vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution and is a significant security risk. It's crucial to implement proper input sanitization or use safer command execution methods to mitigate this vulnerability.
