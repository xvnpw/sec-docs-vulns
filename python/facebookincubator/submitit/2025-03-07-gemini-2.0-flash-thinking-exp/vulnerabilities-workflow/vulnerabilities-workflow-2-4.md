- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `CommandFunction`

- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the Slurm cluster by exploiting the `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction` class.
    2. This vulnerability occurs because the `CommandFunction` does not properly sanitize user-controlled input when constructing shell commands.
    3. An attacker can manipulate the arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) passed to `CommandFunction` if they are derived from user-controlled sources.
    4. When `CommandFunction` is called, it constructs a command list by combining the base command with the provided arguments.
    5. This command list is then executed using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False`. While `shell=False` prevents direct shell injection in the command string itself, it does not prevent command injection through arguments if those arguments contain malicious code.
    6. If an attacker can control the arguments, they can insert malicious shell commands within these arguments.
    7. When `subprocess.Popen` executes the command, these injected commands will be executed on the Slurm cluster.

- Impact:
    - Critical
    - Arbitrary command execution on the Slurm cluster.
    - Full control over the Slurm job execution environment.
    - Potential data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, or further exploitation of the cluster infrastructure.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not perform any sanitization or validation of the arguments passed to `CommandFunction`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement input sanitization for arguments passed to `CommandFunction`. This should include escaping or removing shell-sensitive characters to prevent command injection.
    - Principle of least privilege:  While not a direct code mitigation, encourage users to avoid using `CommandFunction` with user-controlled inputs whenever possible. If it must be used, advise extreme caution and thorough input validation on the user side.
    - Documentation: Add documentation explicitly warning users about the risks of using `CommandFunction` with user-provided input and recommend safer alternatives or sanitization methods.

- Preconditions:
    - The user of the `submitit` library must use `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction` to execute commands.
    - An attacker must be able to control or influence the arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) passed to the `CommandFunction` either directly or indirectly through a user-facing application that utilizes `submitit`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/submitit/core/utils.py`
    - Class: `CommandFunction`
    ```python
    class CommandFunction:
        # ...
        def __call__(self, *args: tp.Any, **kwargs: tp.Any) -> str:
            """Call the cammand line with addidional arguments
            # ...
            """
            full_command = (
                self.command + [str(x) for x in args] + [f"--{x}={y}" for x, y in kwargs.items()]
            )  # TODO bad parsing
            if self.verbose:
                print(f"The following command is sent: \"{' '.join(full_command)}\"")
            with subprocess.Popen(
                full_command,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                shell=False, # shell=False is used, but arguments are not sanitized
                cwd=self.cwd,
                env=self.env,
            ) as process:
                # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the line:
      ```python
      full_command = (
          self.command + [str(x) for x in args] + [f"--{x}={y}" for x, y in kwargs.items()]
      )  # TODO bad parsing
      ```
      - User-provided `args` and `kwargs` are directly converted to strings and appended to the base `self.command` without any sanitization.
      - Even with `shell=False`, if `args` or `kwargs` contain shell commands, `subprocess.Popen` may still execute them, especially if the commands are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the target commands being executed.
      - The `TODO bad parsing` comment in the code itself hints at potential issues with argument parsing, which could be related to or exacerbate command injection risks.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      User Input (Malicious Argument) --> CommandFunction.__call__(*args, **kwargs) --> full_command (Unsanitized) --> subprocess.Popen(full_command, shell=False, ...) --> Slurm Cluster (Command Injection)
      ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Assume you have a Python environment with `submitit` installed and access to a Slurm cluster (or a local environment where `LocalExecutor` can simulate Slurm behavior for testing purposes).
        - Create a Python script (e.g., `test_command_injection.py`).
    2. Script Content (`test_command_injection.py`):
        ```python
        import submitit
        import os

        def vulnerable_function(user_input):
            command_function = submitit.helpers.CommandFunction(["echo", "Hello"])
            # Pass user input directly as an argument to CommandFunction
            command_function(user_input)

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            executor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder="log_command_injection")
            executor.update_parameters(timeout_min=1, slurm_partition="dev") # or use local executor
            malicious_input = "; touch /tmp/pwned ; #" # Malicious input to inject command
            job = executor.submit(vulnerable_function, malicious_input)
            job.result() # Wait for job completion

            # Check if the malicious command was executed (file "/tmp/pwned" created)
            if os.path.exists("/tmp/pwned"):
                print("[VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED] Command injection successful! File '/tmp/pwned' created.")
            else:
                print("[TEST INCONCLUSIVE] Command injection may have failed or file creation failed.")
        ```
    3. Execution:
        - Run the script: `python test_command_injection.py`
    4. Verification:
        - After the script execution, check for the file `/tmp/pwned`.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present. The malicious input `; touch /tmp/pwned ; #` was successfully injected and executed, creating the file.
        - Examine the logs in the `log_command_injection` folder for further details and potential errors.
    5. Expected Result:
        - The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory, indicating successful command injection.
        - The script should print "[VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED] Command injection successful! File '/tmp/pwned' created." to the console.
