#### 1. Unverified Installation from Source
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker creates a modified version of `dcrpm` containing malicious code.
    2. The attacker hosts this malicious version in a separate repository or distributes it through other means.
    3. The attacker uses social engineering to trick a system administrator into downloading and installing this malicious version.
    4. The system administrator, believing they are installing the legitimate `dcrpm`, executes the installation command (e.g., `python setup.py install` or `pip install .`) from the attacker's source.
    5. The installation process proceeds without verifying the integrity or authenticity of the source code, installing the malicious version of `dcrpm` on the system.
- **Impact:**
    - If the malicious `dcrpm` is executed, especially with root privileges as intended, it can lead to full system compromise.
    - An attacker could gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, steal sensitive data, install persistent backdoors, or cause denial of service.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not implement any mechanism to verify the integrity or authenticity of the source code during installation from source using `setup.py` or `pip install .`.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Code Signing:** Implement code signing for releases. This would involve signing official releases of `dcrpm` with a cryptographic key, allowing users to verify the authenticity of the downloaded source code or packages before installation.
    - **Checksums/Hashes:** Provide checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of official releases on the project's website or release notes. Users could then manually verify the integrity of downloaded files before installation.
    - **Secure Installation Instructions and Warnings:**  Clearly document the official and secure methods of installing `dcrpm` (e.g., using distribution packages when available). Include prominent warnings against installing `dcrpm` from untrusted or unofficial sources and emphasize the risks of running `setup.py install` or `pip install .` from unknown repositories.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker has created a malicious version of the `dcrpm` source code.
    - An attacker successfully uses social engineering to convince a system administrator to install the malicious version.
    - The system administrator has the necessary privileges to install software on the target system (typically root or sudo privileges are needed for system-wide installation).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`setup.py` and `legacy_setup.py`:** These files are standard Python setup scripts. They use `setuptools` to manage the installation process.  The scripts install the `dcrpm` package and its dependencies (like `psutil`).  However, they lack any built-in functionality to cryptographically verify the integrity or authenticity of the `dcrpm` source code being installed. The installation process trusts the source directory from which `setup.py` is executed. If an attacker replaces files in this source directory with malicious ones, the installation will proceed without detection.
    - The scripts rely on the inherent trust in the source code location. There are no steps to validate the origin or modification status of the source files.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        a. Fork the official `dcrpm` repository or clone it locally.
        b. Introduce malicious code into `dcrpm/main.py`. For example, add code to create a backdoor that listens on a specific port or to exfiltrate system information to a remote server.
        c. Create a new Git repository containing this modified code or prepare a distribution package (tarball/zip).
        d. Host the malicious repository on a public platform (e.g., a fake GitHub repository) or make the malicious package available for download.
    2. **Social Engineering:**
        a. Craft a social engineering attack targeting system administrators. This could be an email, forum post, or message on a social media platform.
        b. The message should convincingly direct the system administrator to download and install the malicious version of `dcrpm`. For example, the message could claim to offer a critical security update or a new feature, and provide a link to the attacker's malicious repository or package.
        c. Example social engineering lure: "Critical Security Update for dcrpm! A vulnerability has been discovered in older versions of dcrpm. Please update immediately to version 0.6.4 from [attacker's malicious repository URL] to patch this issue. Installation instructions: `git clone [attacker's malicious repository URL] && cd dcrpm && python setup.py install`"
    3. **Victim Action:**
        a. The system administrator, believing the social engineering lure, follows the attacker's instructions.
        b. The system administrator clones the malicious repository or downloads the malicious package.
        c. The system administrator navigates to the downloaded `dcrpm` source directory in their terminal.
        d. The system administrator executes the installation command: `python setup.py install` (potentially with `sudo` if system-wide installation is intended).
    4. **Verification:**
        a. After successful installation (no errors during `setup.py install`), execute the installed `dcrpm` (e.g., `sudo dcrpm`).
        b. Verify if the malicious code is executed. For example, check if the backdoor is active by attempting to connect to it, or monitor network traffic for data exfiltration.
        c. Confirm that the installation process completed without any warnings or errors related to the integrity or authenticity of the installed software, demonstrating the lack of verification.
