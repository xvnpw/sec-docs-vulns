### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: HTTP Response Splitting via Logged URL Path
- Description:
    1. The `import_logs.py` script reads and parses web server access logs.
    2. It extracts the URL path from the log entries and sends this path to the Matomo tracking API as the `url` parameter.
    3. The Matomo tracking API, and consequently Matomo, might process and store this URL path in its database and potentially display it in reports.
    4. If a malicious actor crafts a log entry with a specially crafted URL path containing newline characters (`\n` or `%0A`) or carriage return characters (`\r` or `%0D`), these characters will be interpreted by systems that process the logs downstream from Matomo (e.g., web browsers, log analysis tools) as HTTP header separators.
    5. This can lead to HTTP Response Splitting in downstream systems if they process Matomo's logs that contain the malicious URL path. For example, if Matomo's logs are later served via a web interface without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers and potentially control parts of the HTTP response.
- Impact:
    - Medium
    - An attacker can potentially inject arbitrary HTTP headers into systems that process Matomo's logs, leading to various attacks such as:
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected headers can manipulate the response body or introduce `<script>` tags.
        - Page hijacking or defacement.
        - Cache poisoning.
        - Open redirection.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in `import_logs.py`. The script reads the URL path from the logs and directly passes it to the Matomo API.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization in `import_logs.py` to remove or encode newline and carriage return characters from the extracted URL path before sending it to Matomo.
    - Output sanitization in Matomo when displaying or processing the URL paths stored in its database to prevent HTTP Response Splitting in systems that consume Matomo's data. (Mitigation in Matomo itself is outside the scope of this project, but should be noted as best practice).
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary log lines into the web server access logs that are processed by `import_logs.py`.
    - Downstream systems that process Matomo's logs must be vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `import_logs.py`, the `Parser.parse()` method is responsible for reading log files and extracting data.
    2. Within `Parser.parse()`, the code extracts the path using `hit.path = hit.full_path` or via regex group `path` from matched format.
    3. The extracted `hit.path` is used to construct the `url` parameter in the `Recorder._get_hit_args()` method.
    4. The `url` parameter, which includes the potentially malicious `path`, is then sent to the Matomo tracking API.
    5. There is no sanitization of the `path` variable in `import_logs.py` before it's sent to Matomo.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious log file (e.g., `malicious.log`) with a crafted log entry containing newline characters in the URL path.
    2. Run `import_logs.py` to import the `malicious.log` file into a Matomo instance.
    3. Verify that the log entries are successfully imported into Matomo.
    4. Access Matomo's interface and examine the URL path.
    5. If Matomo's logs are processed by a downstream system, observe if HTTP Response Splitting occurs due to the injected characters.
