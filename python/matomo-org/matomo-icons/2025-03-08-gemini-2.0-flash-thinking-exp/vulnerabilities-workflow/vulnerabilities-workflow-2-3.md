### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG icon files

- Description:
    - An attacker could contribute a malicious SVG icon file to the `matomo-icons` repository.
    - This malicious SVG file could contain embedded JavaScript code within its XML structure, for example within `<script>` tags or event handlers like `onload`.
    - When the `convert.sh` script processes this malicious SVG file, it uses `inkscape` to convert and optimize the SVG. However, `inkscape` by default, and as used in the script, does not remove or sanitize embedded JavaScript within SVG files.
    - The script then saves the processed SVG, or converts it to PNG, in the `dist` directory.
    - If Matomo uses these generated icons from the `dist` directory and serves them directly to users' browsers without proper sanitization of the SVG content, the embedded JavaScript code within the malicious SVG could be executed in the user's browser.
    - This would lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Matomo application.

- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users accessing a Matomo instance that uses these icons.
    - This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        - Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
        - Defacing the Matomo interface presented to users.
        - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        - Injecting malware or further exploits into the user's browser.
        - Accessing sensitive information displayed within the Matomo application.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided scripts and files do not include any explicit sanitization or security measures to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in SVG files. The `convert.sh` script focuses on image conversion and optimization, not security.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **SVG Sanitization:** Implement a step in the `convert.sh` script or a separate sanitization process that removes any potentially malicious JavaScript code or event handlers from SVG files before they are included in the `dist` directory. This could be achieved using tools specifically designed for SVG sanitization, or by parsing and stripping potentially dangerous elements and attributes from the SVG XML.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While not directly in this project, Matomo itself should implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the execution of inline JavaScript and the loading of scripts from untrusted sources. This would act as a defense-in-depth measure to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if malicious SVG icons are served.
    - **Input Validation and Review:** Implement strict input validation and review processes for contributed icons, especially SVG files. Manually or automatically inspect SVG files for embedded JavaScript or suspicious code before accepting them into the repository.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to contribute or influence the SVG icon files that are processed by the `convert.sh` script and subsequently used by Matomo. This could be through:
        - Submitting a malicious SVG icon as a contribution via a pull request.
        - Compromising the repository or development environment to directly inject malicious SVG files.
    - Matomo must be configured to serve the generated icons from the `dist` directory to users' browsers.
    - Matomo must not have implemented sufficient SVG sanitization or CSP to prevent the execution of embedded JavaScript within SVG files.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`convert.sh` script:**
        - The `convert.sh` script is responsible for processing icon files, including SVGs, and converting them into optimized PNGs in the `dist` directory.
        - The function `resizeSvg` is specifically used to handle SVG files.
        - ```bash
          function resizeSvg () {
              inputfile=$1
              outputfile=$2
              if echo "$outputfile" | grep "flags"
              then
                  inkscape -h "$size" "$inputfile" -o "$outputfile"
              else
                  inkscape -h 1024 "$inputfile" -o "$outputfile"
                  mogrify \
                      -background none \
                      -bordercolor transparent -border 1x1 \
                      -trim \
                      -thumbnail "${size}"x"${size}"\> \
                      -unsharp 0x1 \
                      -gravity center \
                      -extent "${size}"x"${size}" \
                      "$outputfile"
              fi
              optimizeIcon "$outputfile"
          }
          ```
        - This function uses `inkscape` to resize the SVG.  `inkscape` itself, when used without specific sanitization flags, will preserve embedded JavaScript within SVG files. The command `-o "$outputfile"` in `inkscape` simply outputs the processed SVG to the specified output file, without any inherent sanitization.
        - Subsequently, `mogrify` is used for further processing (only for non-flag icons), but these operations are focused on image manipulation (trimming, resizing, sharpening) and do not include any SVG sanitization steps.
        - The `optimizeIcon` function uses `pngquant` which is only relevant if the SVG is converted to PNG later in the process (which is not explicitly shown in the `resizeSvg` function itself for all cases, but might happen in the broader context of the script). `pngquant` is for PNG optimization and does not affect the SVG content itself.
        - **No Sanitization:**  The `convert.sh` script completely lacks any step to sanitize SVG files and remove potentially malicious content. It blindly processes SVG files and prepares them for distribution. This means if a malicious SVG is placed in the `src` directory, the script will process it and create a potentially vulnerable icon in the `dist` directory.

    - **Overall Workflow:**
        1.  An attacker provides a malicious SVG file (e.g., via a pull request or by directly modifying files if they have access).
        2.  The `convert.sh` script is executed (likely as part of a build or update process).
        3.  The `resizeSvg` function processes the malicious SVG using `inkscape`, without sanitization.
        4.  The malicious SVG (or a PNG derived from it, still potentially vulnerable if the SVG is served) is placed in the `dist` directory.
        5.  Matomo uses icons from the `dist` directory and serves them to users.
        6.  If Matomo does not sanitize SVG content when serving it, the embedded JavaScript within the malicious SVG will execute in the user's browser, resulting in XSS.

- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Prepare a Malicious SVG File:** Create an SVG file (e.g., `malicious.svg`) containing malicious JavaScript code. For example:
        ```xml
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100">
          <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
          <rect width="100" height="100" fill="red"/>
        </svg>
        ```
    2.  **Place the Malicious SVG in the `src` directory:**  Assume you are a contributor and can create a new icon. Place `malicious.svg` in a relevant subdirectory within the `src` directory, for example `src/browsers/malicious.svg`.
    3.  **Run the `convert.sh` script:** Execute the `convert.sh` script to process the icons. This will generate the icons in the `dist` directory.
    4.  **Locate the Processed Icon:** Find the processed icon in the `dist` directory. In this example, it would be `dist/browsers/malicious.png` (or potentially `dist/browsers/malicious.svg` depending on how Matomo serves icons).
    5.  **Integrate the Icon into Matomo (Simulated):**  Assume you can somehow make Matomo serve this generated icon. For a real test, you would need to modify Matomo's code to use this icon in a visible part of the UI. For a simplified test, you could try to directly access the generated SVG file through a web browser if the web server serves the `dist` directory.
    6.  **Access Matomo in a Browser:** Open a web browser and access the Matomo instance where the malicious icon is now being served.
    7.  **Verify XSS Execution:** Check if the JavaScript code embedded in the `malicious.svg` file is executed. In this example, you should see an alert box with the text "XSS Vulnerability". If the alert box appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
