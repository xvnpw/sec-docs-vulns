## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in intent_exec.sh
- Description:
    1. An attacker can provide a malicious natural language sentence as input to the `intent_exec.sh` script.
    2. The script directly passes this user-provided sentence to the `python -m src.intent_exec.main --intent` command without proper sanitization.
    3. If the Python script `src/intent_exec/main.py` does not adequately sanitize this input before executing system commands or other sensitive operations, it could lead to command injection.
- Impact:
    - High: Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting AutoKube. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized modifications to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The script `intent_exec.sh` directly passes user input to the python script without any sanitization. The python script `src/intent_exec/main.py` was not provided, so it's impossible to determine if sanitization is implemented there, but based on typical LLM examples, input sanitization is often missed.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization in the `intent_exec.sh` script before passing the user input to the Python script. Sanitize special characters and command separators.
    - Input Validation: Validate the user input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and lengths, rejecting any input that appears suspicious.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that the script and the Python application run with the least privileges necessary to perform their intended functions, limiting the impact of a successful injection.
- Preconditions:
    - The `intent_exec.sh` script must be executable by the attacker. This assumes that the `AutoKube` command-line tool, which calls this script, is exposed to the attacker, or the attacker has gained access to the server.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ...
    # Prompt the user for a natural language sentence
    echo -e "${GREEN}Please enter a natural language sentence to determine its intent:${NC}"
    read -r USER_INPUT

    # Call the Python function with the intent as a parameter
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Determining intent and executing the function...${NC}"
    python -m src.intent_exec.main --intent "$USER_INPUT"
    ...
    ```
    - The `intent_exec.sh` script reads user input into the `USER_INPUT` variable using `read -r USER_INPUT`.
    - This `USER_INPUT` variable is then directly used as a parameter in the command `python -m src.intent_exec.main --intent "$USER_INPUT"`.
    - There is no input sanitization or validation performed on `USER_INPUT` before it is passed to the Python script.
    - If the `src.intent_exec.main` Python script processes this `--intent` parameter insecurely (e.g., by executing shell commands based on it without sanitization), a command injection vulnerability exists.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up AutoKube in a test environment.
    2. Access the server where AutoKube is deployed, either via a publicly exposed interface (if applicable) or through internal access.
    3. Execute the `AutoKube` command-line tool, which should present the operations menu.
    4. Select the option that executes `intent_exec.sh` (if directly accessible, run the script).
    5. When prompted to "Please enter a natural language sentence to determine its intent:", enter the following malicious input:
       ```
       ; touch /tmp/pwned; echo vulnerable
       ```
    6. Observe the output.
    7. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created on the server. If the file exists, it confirms command injection.
    8. Additionally, observe the standard output for the string "vulnerable" which would also indicate command execution.
