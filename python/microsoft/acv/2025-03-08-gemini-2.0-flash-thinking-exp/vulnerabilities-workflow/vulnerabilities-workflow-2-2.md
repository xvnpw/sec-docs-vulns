### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in `intent_exec.sh`

- **Description:**
    1. The `intent_exec.sh` script prompts the user to enter a natural language sentence.
    2. This user-provided sentence is captured in the `USER_INPUT` variable.
    3. The script then directly passes the `$USER_INPUT` variable as an argument to the Python script `src/intent_exec/main.py` using the `--intent` flag: `python -m src/intent_exec/main --intent "$USER_INPUT"`.
    4. If the `src/intent_exec/main.py` script does not properly sanitize or validate this input, an attacker could inject malicious commands that will be executed by the Python script.
    5. By crafting a malicious input sentence, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server running the `AutoKube` tool.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    - This could lead to unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster, data exfiltration, modification of configurations, or complete compromise of the AutoKube tool and potentially the managed Kubernetes environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The provided code does not include any input validation or sanitization in `intent_exec.sh` before passing the user input to the Python script.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement input sanitization in `intent_exec.sh` to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before passing the input to the Python script.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the user input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and reject any input that appears malicious or contains unexpected characters.
    - **Secure Coding Practices in `src/intent_exec/main.py`:** Ensure that the Python script `src/intent_exec/main.py` properly handles the `--intent` argument and does not execute shell commands based on unsanitized user input. Use parameterized queries or safe APIs if interacting with system commands.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to have access to execute the `intent_exec.sh` script. This script seems to be part of the "Ops" tooling, suggesting it's intended for operators. However, if an attacker can gain access to execute this script (e.g., through a web interface if exposed, or by compromising an operator's workstation), they can exploit this vulnerability.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ...
    # Prompt the user for a natural language sentence
    echo -e "${GREEN}Please enter a natural language sentence to determine its intent:${NC}"
    read -r USER_INPUT

    # Validate the input
    if [[ -z "$USER_INPUT" ]]; then
        echo -e "${RED}Error: No input provided. Please enter a valid sentence.${NC}"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Display the captured input
    echo -e "${BLUE}Captured sentence:${NC} $USER_INPUT"

    # Call the Python function with the intent as a parameter
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Determining intent and executing the function...${NC}"
    python -m src/intent_exec.main --intent "$USER_INPUT"
    ...
    ```
    - The script captures user input using `read -r USER_INPUT`.
    - It performs a basic check for empty input but lacks any sanitization or validation against malicious input.
    - The `$USER_INPUT` is directly passed to the Python script using command line arguments, which is a common pattern for command injection vulnerabilities if the receiving script does not handle it carefully.
    - The vulnerability lies in the direct and unsanitized use of `USER_INPUT` in the command execution.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `code/self_managing_systems/microservice/AutoKube/scripts/ops/` directory.
    2. Make the `intent_exec.sh` script executable: `chmod +x intent_exec.sh`.
    3. Run the script: `./intent_exec.sh`.
    4. When prompted "Please enter a natural language sentence to determine its intent:", enter the following malicious sentence: `Report pod status; touch /tmp/pwned`.
    5. Observe the output. If the vulnerability exists, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` will be executed on the system.
    6. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists: `ls -l /tmp/pwned`. If the file exists, the command injection was successful.
    7. Additionally, examine the logs of `src/intent_exec/main.py` (if logging is enabled) to confirm the injected command execution.
