### Vulnerability 1: Insecure X.509 Certificate Generation and Handling Practices in Educational Materials

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure X.509 Certificate Generation and Handling Practices
* Description:
    1. The `cert_gen.sh` script is provided as part of educational materials for setting up X.509 certificate-based authentication for IoT devices.
    2. This script generates a root CA certificate and a device certificate for demonstration purposes.
    3. The script does not include guidance or enforce secure practices for storing and managing the generated private keys (`rootCA.key`, `device1.key`).
    4. The `lab3_X509.py` script uses environment variables (`X509_CERT_FILE`, `X509_KEY_FILE`, `X509_PASS_PHRASE`) to load certificates and keys, implying that users might directly use these files in their applications without proper secure storage considerations.
    5. If users follow these examples without implementing proper security measures, they might store private keys insecurely (e.g., directly on the device file system, in easily accessible locations, or without proper access control).
    6. An attacker who gains access to these private keys can impersonate the IoT device.

* Impact:
    - Device impersonation: An attacker who obtains the device's private key (`device1.key`) can impersonate the device and send malicious data to the IoT Hub, potentially disrupting operations or injecting false data into the system.
    - Data manipulation: By impersonating a device, an attacker could potentially manipulate data reported by the legitimate device, leading to incorrect analysis and decision-making based on the IoT data.
    - Unauthorized access: If the root CA private key (`rootCA.key`) is compromised, an attacker could issue their own device certificates, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the IoT system at scale.

* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided scripts or documentation. The materials are purely educational and focus on demonstrating functionality, not secure implementation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Key Storage Guidance:** The tutorial should explicitly warn against insecure storage of private keys. It should recommend best practices for secure key storage, such as using hardware security modules (HSMs), secure enclaves, or encrypted file systems with strong access control.
    - **Key Rotation Guidance:** The tutorial should mention the importance of regular key rotation and certificate renewal to limit the impact of key compromise.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The tutorial should emphasize the principle of least privilege when handling private keys, ensuring that only necessary processes and users have access to them.
    - **Warning about Production Use:** The tutorial should clearly state that the provided scripts are for educational purposes only and should not be used directly in production environments without implementing proper security measures.

* Preconditions:
    - User follows the tutorial and uses the provided `cert_gen.sh` script to generate X.509 certificates and keys.
    - User deploys an IoT solution based on the tutorial examples and insecurely stores the generated private keys.
    - Attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where the private keys are stored (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`MQTT/cert_gen.sh`**:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        # ... (Color definitions) ...
        set -e
        echo "Started script at $(date)"
        mkdir certs;cd certs # Creates a 'certs' directory to store generated files
        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING ROOT CA KEY AND CERTIFICATE..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096 # Generates root CA private key, stored as 'rootCA.key' in 'certs' directory
        openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=MyAwesomeRootCA" # Generates root CA certificate, stored as 'rootCA.pem' in 'certs' directory, signed by rootCA.key
        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING DEVICE KEY AND A CSR..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl genrsa -out device1.key 2048 # Generates device private key, stored as 'device1.key' in 'certs' directory
        openssl req -new -sha256 -key device1.key -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=device1" -out device1.csr # Generates device CSR, stored as 'device1.csr' in 'certs' directory, using device1.key
        openssl req -in device1.csr -noout -text # Displays CSR information
        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING A DEVICE CERTIFICATE..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl x509 -req -in device1.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out device1.pem -days 500 -sha256 # Generates device certificate, stored as 'device1.pem' in 'certs' directory, signed by rootCA.pem and rootCA.key
        openssl x509 -in device1.pem -text -noout # Displays certificate information
        echo -e "${GREEN}" "SCRIPT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"
        echo -e "${NC}"
        ```
        - The script's output are private key files (`rootCA.key`, `device1.key`) stored in the `certs` directory. There's no guidance in the script itself or in the surrounding documentation (based on provided files) on how to securely store these keys.
    - **`MQTT/lab3_X509.py`**:
        ```python
        # ... (Imports) ...
        hostname = os.getenv("HOSTNAME")
        device_id = os.getenv("DEVICE_ID")
        x509 = X509(
            cert_file=os.getenv("X509_CERT_FILE"), # Loads device certificate file path from environment variable
            key_file=os.getenv("X509_KEY_FILE"),  # Loads device private key file path from environment variable
            pass_phrase=os.getenv("X509_PASS_PHRASE"), # Loads passphrase (if any) from environment variable
        )
        device_client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_x509_certificate(
            hostname=hostname, device_id=device_id, x509=x509
        )
        # ... (Rest of the script) ...
        ```
        - The Python script reads certificate and key file paths from environment variables. This approach, while common for configuration, can lead to insecure practices if users are not educated on secure environment variable management or if they directly use the files generated by `cert_gen.sh` without further protection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Follow the tutorial steps to set up an Azure IoT Hub and an IoT Edge device.
        - Run the `cert_gen.sh` script to generate certificates and keys.
        - Configure the `lab3_X509.py` script to use the generated `device1.pem` and `device1.key` files by setting environment variables `X509_CERT_FILE` and `X509_KEY_FILE` to the paths of these files respectively. Do not set `X509_PASS_PHRASE`.
        - Run `lab3_X509.py` to confirm the device connects to IoT Hub and sends messages successfully.
    2. **Simulate Key Compromise:**
        - As an attacker, assume you have gained access to the system where `device1.key` is stored (e.g., by compromising the VM or container where the IoT device application is running). Copy the `device1.key` file.
    3. **Device Impersonation:**
        - On a separate attacker machine, install the Azure IoT Device SDK.
        - Create a new Python script similar to `lab3_X509.py`.
        - Modify the script to use the stolen `device1.key` and the corresponding `device1.pem` (you would also need `device1.pem` in a real attack, but for simplicity, we can reuse it if needed for the test, as the key is the critical part for impersonation).  Ensure the `DEVICE_ID` and `HOSTNAME` environment variables are set to the same values as used by the legitimate device.
        - Run the attacker script.
        - Observe in Azure IoT Hub or Device Explorer that the attacker script successfully connects to IoT Hub as the legitimate device and can send messages.
    4. **Verification:**
        - The attacker's script successfully impersonating the device demonstrates that if the private key is compromised due to insecure storage practices (as implied by the tutorial's lack of guidance), device impersonation is possible.

This test case proves that the lack of guidance on secure key management in the educational materials can lead to a real vulnerability if users implement these examples in production without additional security measures.
