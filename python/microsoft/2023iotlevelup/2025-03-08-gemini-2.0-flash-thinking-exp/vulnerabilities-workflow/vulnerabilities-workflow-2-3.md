### Vulnerability 1: Insecure Use of Self-Signed Certificates for Device Authentication

*   **Description:**
    1.  The training material provides a script `cert_gen.sh` to generate self-signed X.509 certificates for device authentication with Azure IoT Hub.
    2.  This script creates a root CA certificate and a device certificate signed by this root CA.
    3.  The `lab3_X509.py` script demonstrates how to use these self-signed certificates for device authentication.
    4.  The training material might not sufficiently emphasize that self-signed certificates are primarily for development and testing purposes and are **not recommended for production environments**.
    5.  If users follow the training and deploy devices to production using self-signed certificates generated by the provided script, they introduce a security vulnerability.
    6.  An attacker who gains access to the private key of the self-signed root CA certificate (e.g., through insecure storage or accidental exposure) can impersonate any device that uses a certificate signed by this root CA.
    7.  Additionally, managing and rotating self-signed certificates in a production environment is complex and error-prone compared to using certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or using other secure provisioning methods like Device Provisioning Service (DPS) with proper attestation mechanisms.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** If the self-signed root CA private key is compromised, an attacker can impersonate any number of IoT devices in the solution. This allows the attacker to send malicious data to the IoT Hub, potentially disrupting operations, manipulating data, or gaining unauthorized access to downstream systems that rely on the integrity of the IoT data. The attacker could also potentially send commands to devices if device management features are used.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The training material provides the script and example without explicitly warning against using self-signed certificates in production or detailing secure certificate management practices for production scenarios.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Explicit Warning:** The training material should include a clear and prominent warning against using self-signed certificates generated by `cert_gen.sh` in production environments.
    *   **Production Alternatives:** The training should explain and recommend secure alternatives for device authentication in production, such as:
        *   Using certificates issued by a trusted public Certificate Authority (CA).
        *   Using Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) with:
            *   X.509 certificates chained to a trusted root CA.
            *   Trusted Platform Module (TPM) attestation.
            *   Symmetric key attestation (with caveats about key management).
        *   Managed identities for IoT Edge modules where applicable.
    *   **Secure Certificate Management Guidance:** If self-signed certificates are used even for testing, the training should provide basic guidance on securely storing and managing the private keys, emphasizing that private keys should never be exposed in public repositories or insecure locations.
    *   **Certificate Rotation Best Practices:**  Briefly mention the importance of certificate rotation and the challenges of managing self-signed certificate rotation compared to using a proper PKI or DPS.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  Users must follow the training material and use the provided `cert_gen.sh` script to generate self-signed certificates.
    2.  Users must then configure their IoT devices and Azure IoT Hub to use these self-signed certificates for authentication.
    3.  Users must deploy this configuration to a production environment without further security hardening or understanding of the risks associated with self-signed certificates.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **File: `/code/MQTT/cert_gen.sh`**
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        # ... (Coloring variables) ...
        set -e

        echo "Started script at $(date)"
        mkdir certs;cd certs

        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING ROOT CA KEY AND CERTIFICATE..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096  # Generates root CA private key
        openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=MyAwesomeRootCA" # Generates self-signed root CA certificate

        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING DEVICE KEY AND A CSR..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl genrsa -out device1.key 2048 # Generates device private key
        openssl req -new -sha256 -key device1.key -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=device1" -out device1.csr # Generates device CSR
        openssl req -in device1.csr -noout -text # Displays CSR details

        echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING A DEVICE CERTIFICATE..."
        echo -e "${NC}"
        openssl x509 -req -in device1.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out device1.pem -days 500 -sha256 # Signs device certificate using root CA
        openssl x509 -in device1.pem -text -noout # Displays device certificate details

        echo -e "${GREEN}" "SCRIPT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"
        echo -e "${NC}"
        ```
        *   The script uses `openssl` commands to generate a root CA key (`rootCA.key`) and a self-signed root CA certificate (`rootCA.pem`).
        *   It then generates a device key (`device1.key`) and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) (`device1.csr`).
        *   Finally, it signs the device CSR using the root CA key and certificate to create the device certificate (`device1.pem`).
        *   The script itself is functional for generating self-signed certificates, but it lacks any warnings or guidance on the appropriate use of these certificates.

    *   **File: `/code/MQTT/lab3_X509.py`**
        ```python
        # ... (License header and imports) ...
        hostname = os.getenv("HOSTNAME")
        device_id = os.getenv("DEVICE_ID")

        x509 = X509(
            cert_file=os.getenv("X509_CERT_FILE"),
            key_file=os.getenv("X509_KEY_FILE"),
            pass_phrase=os.getenv("X509_PASS_PHRASE"), # Passphrase is optional and likely not used in the training example
        )
        device_client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_x509_certificate(
            hostname=hostname, device_id=device_id, x509=x509
        )
        # ... (rest of the script to send messages) ...
        ```
        *   This script demonstrates how to use X.509 certificates for device authentication by loading certificate and key files from environment variables.
        *   It uses the `azure-iot-device` SDK to create an `IoTHubDeviceClient` authenticated with the provided X.509 credentials.
        *   The script functions as intended for demonstrating X.509 authentication, but it doesn't inherently address the security implications of using self-signed certificates in production.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Follow the instructions in the training material to generate self-signed certificates using `cert_gen.sh`.
    2.  Configure an Azure IoT Hub to accept X.509 CA signed devices.
    3.  Create an IoT Edge device or simulate an IoT device and configure it to use the generated `device1.pem` and `device1.key` for authentication, as demonstrated in `lab3_X509.py`.
    4.  Verify that the device successfully connects to the IoT Hub and can send telemetry. This confirms the basic functionality of using self-signed certificates.
    5.  **To demonstrate the vulnerability:** In a non-production test environment, simulate a key compromise by making a copy of the `rootCA.key` file available to a hypothetical attacker.
    6.  The attacker can then use this `rootCA.key` to sign a new device certificate for a different "rogue" device, without needing legitimate device credentials or access to the original device.
    7.  Configure this rogue device to connect to the same IoT Hub using the newly signed certificate.
    8.  Observe that the rogue device can successfully authenticate and send telemetry to the IoT Hub, impersonating a legitimate device because the IoT Hub trusts the self-signed root CA.
    9.  This test demonstrates that compromising the root CA private key allows for unauthorized device impersonation, highlighting the risk of using self-signed certificates in scenarios where the root CA key's security is not rigorously maintained, which is often the case in production deployments compared to properly managed PKI.
