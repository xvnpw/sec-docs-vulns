### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: SharePoint Link Compromise Leading to Malware Distribution/Phishing
    - Description:
        - The repository's README.md files contain links to external SharePoint resources for training materials and lab guides.
        - If the linked SharePoint site is compromised by an attacker, the attacker could replace the legitimate training materials with malicious files (e.g., malware, trojans) or redirect the links to phishing websites.
        - Users who trust the repository and click on these SharePoint links would unknowingly download malware or be redirected to phishing sites, potentially leading to system compromise or credential theft.
    - Impact:
        - Users who click on the compromised SharePoint links could have their systems infected with malware, leading to data theft, system instability, or further propagation of malware.
        - Users could be redirected to phishing websites designed to steal their credentials (e.g., Microsoft account credentials), leading to unauthorized access to their accounts and potentially sensitive information.
    - Vulnerability rank: High
    - Currently implemented mitigations:
        - None. The repository itself does not implement any mitigations against compromised external links. The security relies entirely on the security measures implemented by Microsoft SharePoint Online.
    - Missing mitigations:
        - Content Integrity Checks: Implementing checksums or digital signatures for the linked files within the repository. This would allow users to verify the integrity of the downloaded files against expected values, even if the SharePoint site is compromised.
        - Link Verification Warnings: Adding clear warnings next to the SharePoint links, advising users to be cautious about external links and to verify the source before downloading or providing information.
        - Mirroring Critical Content: Hosting essential, non-changing training materials directly within the repository itself as backup. This reduces the reliance on external SharePoint links for core content.
        - Regular Link Audits: Periodically checking the SharePoint links to ensure they are still pointing to the intended legitimate resources and haven't been redirected or modified unexpectedly.
    - Preconditions:
        - The attacker must successfully compromise the linked Microsoft SharePoint site.
        - Users must trust the links provided in the repository's README.md files and click on them.
    - Source code analysis:
        - The following files contain direct links to external SharePoint resources:
            - `/code/README.md`:

                ```
        - There is no code within the repository that validates the integrity, authenticity, or security of these external SharePoint links or the content they point to.
    - Security test case:
        1. **Setup (Attacker):** Assume an attacker has successfully compromised the `microsoft.sharepoint.com` site hosting the training materials linked in `/code/README.md` and `/code/IoT Hub & DPS/README.md`.
        2. **Setup (Attacker):** The attacker replaces one of the training documents (e.g., the "Hand-On Lab Setup Guide") with a malicious file containing malware, disguised to look like a legitimate document. Alternatively, the attacker modifies the link to redirect to a phishing page that mimics a Microsoft login page.
        3. **Action (User):** A user, intending to learn about Azure IoT, navigates to the `/code/README.md` or `/code/IoT Hub & DPS/README.md` file in the repository.
        4. **Action (User):** The user clicks on one of the SharePoint links, such as "Level-Up Skilling SharePoint Link" or "Hand-On Lab Setup Guide".
        5. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability):**
            - If the attacker replaced the document with malware: The user is redirected to the compromised SharePoint site and unknowingly downloads the malicious file. If the user executes this file, their system becomes infected with malware.
            - If the attacker redirected to a phishing page: The user is redirected to a fake login page. If the user enters their credentials, these credentials are stolen by the attacker.
        6. **Actual Outcome (Vulnerability):** The user, believing they are accessing legitimate training material from a trusted source (Microsoft repository), is exposed to malware or a phishing attack due to the compromised external SharePoint link.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Device Authentication using Hardcoded Connection String
    - Description:
        - The example code in `lab1.py` demonstrates device authentication using connection strings retrieved from environment variables (`os.getenv("conn_str")`).
        - The README and comments in the code might inadvertently encourage users to directly use or hardcode connection strings for simplicity in testing or development.
        - If users follow this practice and hardcode connection strings in their applications or scripts, especially in production environments, it can lead to unauthorized access to the IoT Hub and potential data breaches.
        - An attacker who gains access to the source code or configuration files where the connection string is hardcoded can impersonate the device and send/receive data, control devices, or disrupt operations.
    - Impact:
        - High. Unauthorized access to IoT devices and IoT Hub.
        - Potential data breaches, device manipulation, and disruption of IoT services.
    - Vulnerability Rank: High
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - None in the example code itself. The code uses environment variables, which is a better practice than hardcoding directly in the script.
    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Explicit warning in README and code comments against hardcoding connection strings.
        - Best practices guidance on secure storage and management of connection strings, such as using secure vaults or configuration management systems.
        - Emphasize the importance of using more secure authentication methods like X.509 certificates or TPM in production.
    - Preconditions:
        - User follows the example code and hardcodes the connection string instead of using environment variables or secure configuration management.
        - Attacker gains access to the hardcoded connection string (e.g., through source code repository, configuration file, or compromised system).
    - Source Code Analysis:
        - File: `/code/MQTT/lab1.py`
        - Line 2: `conn_str = os.getenv("conn_str")` - This line retrieves the connection string from an environment variable. While this is better than hardcoding, the lack of explicit warnings around the example can lead to insecure practices.
        - Line 8-12: `if conn_str == None: ... quit()` - This check ensures the environment variable is set, but doesn't prevent users from hardcoding for testing, which is a risk if the code is not properly secured later.
        - Review of README files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/IoT Hub & DPS/README.md`, `/code/IoT Hub & DPS/Code/README.md`, `/code/IoTEdge & Microagent/README.md`, `/code/IoTEdge & Microagent/Hands on Lab.md`, `/code/IoTEdge & Microagent/Lab Prerequisites.md`) shows no explicit warnings against hardcoding connection strings in production environments.
    - Security test case:
        1. Setup:
            - Create an IoT Hub and an IoT device.
            - Obtain the device connection string.
            - Modify `lab1.py` to hardcode the connection string directly in the script: `conn_str = "HostName=YOUR_IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME;DeviceId=YOUR_DEVICE_ID;SharedAccessKey=YOUR_DEVICE_PRIMARY_KEY"`.
            - Run the modified `lab1.py` script and verify successful connection and message sending to IoT Hub.
        2. Exploit:
            - Assume attacker gains access to the modified `lab1.py` and extracts the hardcoded connection string.
            - Attacker uses the extracted connection string with Azure CLI to send a message impersonating the device:
              ```bash
              az iot hub send-d2c-message --hub-name YOUR_IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME --device-id YOUR_DEVICE_ID --body "{\"message\": \"Attacker Message\"}" --connection-string "HostName=YOUR_IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME;DeviceId=YOUR_DEVICE_ID;SharedAccessKey=YOUR_DEVICE_PRIMARY_KEY"
              ```
        3. Verification:
            - Observe that the attacker successfully sends messages to the IoT Hub using the hardcoded connection string, demonstrating unauthorized device access.
            - Check IoT Hub logs to confirm receipt of messages from the device (or attacker impersonating it).

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure X.509 Certificate Generation and Handling Practices
    - Description:
        - The `cert_gen.sh` script is provided as part of educational materials for setting up X.509 certificate-based authentication for IoT devices.
        - This script generates a root CA certificate and a device certificate for demonstration purposes.
        - The script does not include guidance or enforce secure practices for storing and managing the generated private keys (`rootCA.key`, `device1.key`).
        - The `lab3_X509.py` script uses environment variables (`X509_CERT_FILE`, `X509_KEY_FILE`, `X509_PASS_PHRASE`) to load certificates and keys, implying that users might directly use these files in their applications without proper secure storage considerations.
        - If users follow these examples without implementing proper security measures, they might store private keys insecurely (e.g., directly on the device file system, in easily accessible locations, or without proper access control).
        - An attacker who gains access to these private keys can impersonate the IoT device.
    - Impact:
        - Device impersonation: An attacker who obtains the device's private key (`device1.key`) can impersonate the device and send malicious data to the IoT Hub, potentially disrupting operations or injecting false data into the system.
        - Data manipulation: By impersonating a device, an attacker could potentially manipulate data reported by the legitimate device, leading to incorrect analysis and decision-making based on the IoT data.
        - Unauthorized access: If the root CA private key (`rootCA.key`) is compromised, an attacker could issue their own device certificates, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the IoT system at scale.
    - Vulnerability Rank: High
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - None in the provided scripts or documentation. The materials are purely educational and focus on demonstrating functionality, not secure implementation.
    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Secure Key Storage Guidance: The tutorial should explicitly warn against insecure storage of private keys. It should recommend best practices for secure key storage, such as using hardware security modules (HSMs), secure enclaves, or encrypted file systems with strong access control.
        - Key Rotation Guidance: The tutorial should mention the importance of regular key rotation and certificate renewal to limit the impact of key compromise.
        - Principle of Least Privilege: The tutorial should emphasize the principle of least privilege when handling private keys, ensuring that only necessary processes and users have access to them.
        - Warning about Production Use: The tutorial should clearly state that the provided scripts are for educational purposes only and should not be used directly in production environments without implementing proper security measures.
    - Preconditions:
        - User follows the tutorial and uses the provided `cert_gen.sh` script to generate X.509 certificates and keys.
        - User deploys an IoT solution based on the tutorial examples and insecurely stores the generated private keys.
        - Attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where the private keys are stored (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).
    - Source Code Analysis:
        - **`MQTT/cert_gen.sh`**:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            # ... (Color definitions) ...
            set -e
            echo "Started script at $(date)"
            mkdir certs;cd certs # Creates a 'certs' directory to store generated files
            echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING ROOT CA KEY AND CERTIFICATE..."
            echo -e "${NC}"
            openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096 # Generates root CA private key, stored as 'rootCA.key' in 'certs' directory
            openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=MyAwesomeRootCA" # Generates root CA certificate, stored as 'rootCA.pem' in 'certs' directory, signed by rootCA.key
            echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING DEVICE KEY AND A CSR..."
            echo -e "${NC}"
            openssl genrsa -out device1.key 2048 # Generates device private key, stored as 'device1.key' in 'certs' directory
            openssl req -new -sha256 -key device1.key -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/O=Microsoft/CN=device1" -out device1.csr # Generates device CSR, stored as 'device1.csr' in 'certs' directory, using device1.key
            openssl req -in device1.csr -noout -text # Displays CSR information
            echo -e "${GREEN}" "GENERATING A DEVICE CERTIFICATE..."
            echo -e "${NC}"
            openssl x509 -req -in device1.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out device1.pem -days 500 -sha256 # Generates device certificate, stored as 'device1.pem' in 'certs' directory, signed by rootCA.pem and rootCA.key
            openssl x509 -in device1.pem -text -noout # Displays certificate information
            echo -e "${GREEN}" "SCRIPT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"
            echo -e "${NC}"
            ```
            - The script's output are private key files (`rootCA.key`, `device1.key`) stored in the `certs` directory. There's no guidance in the script itself or in the surrounding documentation (based on provided files) on how to securely store these keys.
        - **`MQTT/lab3_X509.py`**:
            ```python
            # ... (Imports) ...
            hostname = os.getenv("HOSTNAME")
            device_id = os.getenv("DEVICE_ID")
            x509 = X509(
                cert_file=os.getenv("X509_CERT_FILE"), # Loads device certificate file path from environment variable
                key_file=os.getenv("X509_KEY_FILE"),  # Loads device private key file path from environment variable
                pass_phrase=os.getenv("X509_PASS_PHRASE"), # Loads passphrase (if any) from environment variable
            )
            device_client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_x509_certificate(
                hostname=hostname, device_id=device_id, x509=x509
            )
            # ... (Rest of the script) ...
            ```
            - The Python script reads certificate and key file paths from environment variables. This approach, while common for configuration, can lead to insecure practices if users are not educated on secure environment variable management or if they directly use the files generated by `cert_gen.sh` without further protection.
    - Security Test Case:
        1. **Prerequisites:**
            - Follow the tutorial steps to set up an Azure IoT Hub and an IoT Edge device.
            - Run the `cert_gen.sh` script to generate certificates and keys.
            - Configure the `lab3_X509.py` script to use the generated `device1.pem` and `device1.key` files by setting environment variables `X509_CERT_FILE` and `X509_KEY_FILE` to the paths of these files respectively. Do not set `X509_PASS_PHRASE`.
            - Run `lab3_X509.py` to confirm the device connects to IoT Hub and sends messages successfully.
        2. **Simulate Key Compromise:**
            - As an attacker, assume you have gained access to the system where `device1.key` is stored (e.g., by compromising the VM or container where the IoT device application is running). Copy the `device1.key` file.
        3. **Device Impersonation:**
            - On a separate attacker machine, install the Azure IoT Device SDK.
            - Create a new Python script similar to `lab3_X509.py`.
            - Modify the script to use the stolen `device1.key` and the corresponding `device1.pem` (you would also need `device1.pem` in a real attack, but for simplicity, we can reuse it if needed for the test, as the key is the critical part for impersonation).  Ensure the `DEVICE_ID` and `HOSTNAME` environment variables are set to the same values as used by the legitimate device.
            - Run the attacker script.
            - Observe in Azure IoT Hub or Device Explorer that the attacker script successfully connects to IoT Hub as the legitimate device and can send messages.
        4. **Verification:**
            - The attacker's script successfully impersonating the device demonstrates that if the private key is compromised due to insecure storage practices (as implied by the tutorial's lack of guidance), device impersonation is possible.
