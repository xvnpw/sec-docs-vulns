### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Wandb Output Directory Configuration
- Description:
    1. A malicious user can control the `UOUTDIR` environment variable before running `src/entry.py`.
    2. The `initialize_wandb` function in `src/entry.py` uses `cfg.wandb.buf_dir` to decide where to create the wandb directory.
    3. If `cfg.wandb.buf_dir` is set to `true`, the code constructs a `wandb_dir` path using `os.path.join` and the potentially attacker-controlled `UOUTDIR` environment variable.
    4. If a malicious user sets `UOUTDIR` to a path like `/tmp/../../`, the `os.path.join` function will resolve this path, potentially leading to writing wandb files outside the intended output directory.
    5. When `move_output_to_wandb_dir` function is called, it copies files from the resolved `wandb_dir` (potentially outside the intended output directory) to `cfg.output_dir` which is also derived from `UOUTDIR`. While the copy destination is still based on `UOUTDIR`, the source path from `wandb_dir` is already resolved and potentially points to a location outside the intended project output directory.
- Impact:
    - **High:** An attacker could potentially write files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system if the user executes `src/entry.py` with a maliciously crafted `UOUTDIR` and `wandb.buf_dir=true`. This could lead to overwriting critical system files, planting malicious scripts, or exfiltrating sensitive information if combined with other vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses `os.path.join` but does not sanitize or validate the `UOUTDIR` environment variable.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of environment variables, especially `UOUTDIR`, before using them in file path construction.
    - Restricting the output directories to a predefined set of safe locations and preventing user-defined paths.
    - Using absolute paths for output directories instead of relying on user-provided environment variables.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must run `src/entry.py` with `wandb.buf_dir=true`.
    - The attacker must be able to control the `UOUTDIR` environment variable before the user executes the script. This is typically possible in local execution environments or shared computing environments if environment variables are not properly managed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/src/entry.py`**
    ```python
    def initialize_wandb(cfg):
        # ...
        if cfg.wandb.buf_dir:
            # ...
            amlt_output_dir = os.environ['AMLT_DIRSYNC_DIR'] if "AMLT_DIRSYNC_DIR" in os.environ else None
            wandb_dir_prefix = amlt_output_dir if amlt_output_dir else os.path.join(root, "output")
            wandb_dir = os.path.join(wandb_dir_prefix, unique_dir) # POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY: Using os.path.join with UOUTDIR (via wandb_dir_prefix) without sanitization
            print("Using wandb buffer dir: ", wandb_dir)
        else:
            wandb_dir = cfg.output_dir # cfg.output_dir is derived from paths.output_dir which is derived from UOUTDIR

        os.makedirs(wandb_dir, exist_ok=True) # Creates directory at potentially attacker-controlled path

        wandb.init(
            # ...
            dir=wandb_dir, # wandb library will use this directory
            # ...
        )
        return wandb_dir

    def move_output_to_wandb_dir(src_dir, dest_dir):
        # ...
        utils.copy_all_files(src_dir, dest_dir) # Copies files from potentially attacker-controlled path
        # ...
    ```
    - The code directly uses `os.path.join` with `UOUTDIR` to construct `wandb_dir` when `cfg.wandb.buf_dir` is true.
    - The `wandb_dir` is then used to create directories and initialize wandb, leading to file operations in the constructed path.
    - The `move_output_to_wandb_dir` function then copies files from this potentially malicious `wandb_dir`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Clone the repository to your local machine.
        - Do not modify any code files.
    2. **Environment Preparation:**
        - Set the `UOUTDIR` environment variable to a malicious path, e.g., `export UOUTDIR='/tmp/../../'` in a Linux/macOS environment or `set UOUTDIR=C:\..\..\` in Windows.
        - Set `UDATADIR` and `UPRJDIR` to valid temporary directories, e.g., `export UDATADIR=/tmp/data` and `export UPRJDIR=/tmp/code`. Create these directories if they don't exist: `mkdir -p /tmp/data /tmp/code`.
    3. **Execution:**
        - Run the `src/entry.py` script with `wandb.buf_dir=online` to trigger the vulnerable code path: `python src/entry.py wandb.mode=online wandb.buf_dir=true`. You can use any experiment and environment, for example: `python src/entry.py wandb.mode=online wandb.buf_dir=true experiment=sac env.name=Ant-v4 env.delay=4`.
    4. **Verification:**
        - After the script executes, check the `/tmp/` directory. You should find a directory created by wandb in `/tmp/` (e.g., `/tmp/wandb/run-timestamp-randomchars`). This indicates that the `wandb_dir` was resolved to a path outside the intended project output directory, demonstrating path traversal.
        - Ideally, try to observe if files are written to unintended locations based on the malicious path, although the provided code mainly focuses on directory creation and wandb initialization within the resolved path. For a more impactful test, you could modify `move_output_to_wandb_dir` to create a file in `src_dir` before copying to verify file writing outside the intended directory. For example, add `os.makedirs(src_dir, exist_ok=True)` and `open(os.path.join(src_dir, "test_file.txt"), 'w').close()` right before `utils.copy_all_files(src_dir, dest_dir)`. Then check if `test_file.txt` is created in `/tmp/wandb/run-timestamp-randomchars` (or similar resolved malicious path).

This vulnerability allows writing files to an attacker-controlled location due to unsanitized environment variable usage in path construction.
