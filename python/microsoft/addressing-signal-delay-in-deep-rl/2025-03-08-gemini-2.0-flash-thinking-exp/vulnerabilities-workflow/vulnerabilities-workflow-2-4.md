### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Real-world Deployment due to Simulation-Optimized Parameters

* Description:
    1. A user deploys the deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which are designed and tested primarily in simulation, onto a real-world robotic system.
    2. The user utilizes configuration files (e.g., from `/code/configs/`) and hyperparameters that are optimized for simulated environments.
    3. Due to the discrepancies between the simulation and the real world (e.g., unmodeled noise, sensor inaccuracies, different physical dynamics), these simulation-optimized parameters lead to unexpected and potentially unsafe robot behavior in the real world.
    4. The robot may exhibit instability, erratic movements, or fail to perform the intended task safely, potentially causing damage to the robot or its surroundings, or even injury.

* Impact:
    - Unpredictable and potentially hazardous behavior of real-world robots.
    - Increased risk of robot malfunction, damage to equipment, or physical injury in real-world deployments.
    - Reduced reliability and safety of robotic systems utilizing these algorithms outside of controlled simulation environments.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `README.md` file explicitly states in the "Out of Scope Uses" and "Limitations" sections that the algorithms are developed and tested in simulation only and are not validated for real-world robots.
    - The "Safe and Responsible Use" section in `README.md` warns users about physical safety risks and emphasizes the need for comprehensive testing before real-world deployment.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - There are no warnings or disclaimers embedded directly within the configuration files themselves to caution users against using simulation-optimized settings in real-world applications.
    - The project lacks pre-defined configuration profiles or guidelines specifically tailored for safer initial real-world testing or deployment.
    - No automated checks or software-level safeguards are in place to detect or prevent potentially unsafe parameter configurations when the algorithms are initialized or deployed in a real-world context.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must attempt to deploy the provided deep reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical robot.
    2. The user must utilize the algorithm with configuration parameters that are primarily designed and optimized for simulation, without sufficient real-world adaptation and validation.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `/code/configs/` directory contains various YAML configuration files that define hyperparameters for training and algorithm behavior in simulation. For example, `configs/experiment/sac.yaml`, `configs/env/Ant-v4.yaml`, and `configs/train.yaml` contain numerous parameters controlling aspects like learning rates, network architectures, and environment settings.
    2. The `README.md` file (File: `/code/README.md`) clearly outlines the "Limitations" and "Out of Scope Uses," stating, "These algorithms were developed in a simulated environment and have not been tested for use in real robots." and "Deploying the algorithms in the real world would require additional code development and testing."
    3. The `src/entry.py` script (File: `/code/src/entry.py`) uses Hydra to load and instantiate configurations directly from these YAML files. The line `cfg = hydra.utils.instantiate(cfg)` in `main(cfg)` function demonstrates direct instantiation of the configuration, implying that any parameters defined in the configuration are directly used without further safety checks or real-world adaptation considerations within the provided code.
    4. The `src/runner.py` (File: `/code/src/runner.py`) implements the core RL algorithms and training/evaluation logic. It relies on the configurations loaded by `entry.py` to define network parameters, training schedules, and environment interactions. There is no explicit code within `runner.py` to validate or adjust configurations based on real-world safety constraints.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Assume a simulated robotic arm environment is set up using the provided code and configurations (e.g., MuJoCo with `Ant-v4` environment and `SAC` algorithm from `configs/experiment/sac.yaml`).
    2. **Parameter Selection**: Identify a hyperparameter in the configuration files that could critically impact real-world safety if misconfigured. For instance, consider the learning rate (`actor_optim.lr` in `configs/experiment/sac.yaml`). A learning rate optimized for simulation might be too aggressive for a real robot, causing overreactions or instability.
    3. **Configuration Modification**: Without modifying the core algorithm code, demonstrate how a user could inadvertently use a simulation-optimized configuration for a hypothetical real-world deployment. This can be shown by simply pointing to the existing configuration files and the instantiation process in `src/entry.py`.
    4. **Conceptual Real-world Scenario**: Describe a scenario where deploying a real robotic arm with the simulation-optimized learning rate (or chosen parameter) could lead to hazardous behavior. For example, a high learning rate could cause the robot arm to oscillate violently or react unpredictably to sensor inputs in a noisy real-world environment.
    5. **Documentation**: Document the potential vulnerability. Highlight that while the code itself may function as intended within simulation, the lack of real-world safety considerations in the configuration defaults and deployment guidance creates a vulnerability when users attempt to transfer these algorithms directly to physical systems. Emphasize that the `README.md` provides warnings, but these are not enforced or further mitigated by the software itself.
