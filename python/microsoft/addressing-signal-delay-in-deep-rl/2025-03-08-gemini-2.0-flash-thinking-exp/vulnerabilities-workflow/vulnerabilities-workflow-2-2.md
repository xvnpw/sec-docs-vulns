- Vulnerability Name: MuJoCo Library Download Hijacking
  - Description:
    1. The project's README.md provides instructions for manually installing the MuJoCo library, a dependency required to run the deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
    2. The instructions include a command using `curl` to download the MuJoCo library archive file `mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` from the URL `<https://mujoco.org/download/mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz>`.
    3. A malicious actor could compromise the `mujoco.org` website or conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack during the download process.
    4. By compromising the download source, the attacker could replace the legitimate MuJoCo archive with a malicious archive containing backdoors or malware.
    5. Users who follow the README instructions to manually install MuJoCo would unknowingly download and install the compromised library onto their systems.
    6. When users execute the reinforcement learning algorithms provided in this project, the malicious MuJoCo library could execute arbitrary code, granting the attacker control over the user's system.
  - Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
    - Potential for complete system compromise, including data theft, installation of malware, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the user's system.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project's README provides instructions for manual installation without any security considerations or integrity checks for the downloaded MuJoCo library.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check using Checksums:** The README should include the official checksum (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the MuJoCo library archive file. Users should be instructed to verify the checksum of their downloaded file against the provided checksum to ensure its integrity and authenticity before installation.
    - **HTTPS Recommendation:** While `mujoco.org` likely uses HTTPS, the README should explicitly recommend verifying that the download URL in the `curl` command starts with `https://` to encourage secure connections and mitigate simple MITM attacks.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** The README should include a clear and prominent security warning about the risks associated with manually downloading and installing binary libraries from external websites. Users should be advised to download MuJoCo only from the official MuJoCo website and to exercise caution during manual installation processes.
  - Preconditions:
    1. An attacker successfully compromises the `mujoco.org` website or is able to perform a MITM attack to intercept and modify network traffic.
    2. A user follows the instructions in the project's README.md to manually install MuJoCo.
    3. The user does not independently verify the integrity of the downloaded MuJoCo library archive.
    4. The user executes any Python script from the project that utilizes the installed MuJoCo library.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
      - Line: Within the "Using Pip/Conda" section, the following code block contains the vulnerable instruction:
        ```bash
        curl <https://mujoco.org/download/mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz> --output mujoco210.tar.gz
        mkdir ~/.mujoco
        tar -xf mujoco210.tar.gz --directory ~/.mujoco
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
        ```
      - Vulnerability: The `curl` command directly downloads a binary archive from `mujoco.org` without any mechanism for verifying its integrity. An attacker could potentially replace the hosted archive with a malicious version at the source or during transit (via MITM).
    - Mitigation Analysis: No other files in the provided project repository implement any mitigations for this vulnerability. The project entirely relies on the security of the external `mujoco.org` website and the user's manual installation process.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:**
        - Create a controlled testing environment that mirrors a typical user's setup for this project, including a Python environment with the project's dependencies (excluding MuJoCo initially).
        - Set up an attacker-controlled web server that hosts a malicious replacement `mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` archive. This malicious archive should contain a benign payload for testing purposes, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory (e.g., `/tmp/pwned_mujoco`) when the library is loaded.
        - Modify a local copy of the project's `/code/README.md` file. In the "Using Pip/Conda" section, replace the original `curl` command URL with the URL of the malicious archive hosted on the attacker-controlled server.
    2. **Vulnerability Trigger:**
        - In the controlled testing environment, follow the modified instructions in the local README.md to download and "install" MuJoCo. This will download the malicious archive from the attacker's server instead of the legitimate MuJoCo library.
        - Navigate to the project's `/code/` directory in the terminal.
        - Execute one of the example Python scripts, such as `python src/entry.py experiment=sac env.name=Ant-v4 env.delay=4`, to initiate the reinforcement learning algorithm that will load the installed MuJoCo library.
    3. **Verification of Exploit:**
        - After running the Python script, check for the presence of the benign payload indicator. For example, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned_mujoco` has been created on the system. The existence of this file confirms that code from the malicious MuJoCo library has been executed.
        - Examine system logs for any unexpected or malicious activities, such as unauthorized file access, network connections to unknown destinations, or unusual process executions, which could further indicate successful arbitrary code execution due to the compromised library.
