### - Vulnerability name: Input Data Injection leading to Forecast Manipulation
- Description:
    - An attacker can craft malicious input data within NetCDF files provided to the `inference.py` script.
    - This manipulation can involve altering weather observation data, satellite imagery, or HRRR forecast data within these files.
    - By injecting this malicious data, the attacker can influence the ADAF model to generate incorrect or misleading weather forecasts.
    - The `inference.py` script reads these NetCDF files using the `read_sample_file_and_norm_input` function, which in turn uses `xr.open_dataset` to parse the file.
    - The system then proceeds with data normalization and model inference without any explicit validation or sanitization of the input data.
    - This lack of validation allows malicious data to directly impact the model's computations and the resulting forecasts.
- Impact:
    - Generation of incorrect or misleading weather forecasts.
    - Misleading public weather alerts, potentially causing inappropriate responses to weather events.
    - Incorrect operational decisions in weather-sensitive sectors such as aviation, agriculture, and emergency services, leading to financial losses, safety risks, or inefficient resource allocation.
    - Damage to the reputation and trust in the forecasting system and the organizations relying on it.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Data Normalization: Input data is normalized using pre-computed statistics as seen in `utils/data_loader_multifiles.py`. This is intended for data processing, not as a security mitigation, and does not prevent malicious data injection.
    - File Format: The use of NetCDF, a binary data format, provides a limited level of implicit protection against simple text-based injection attempts, but it is not designed as a security feature.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input Validation: The system lacks input validation to check the integrity, format, and expected ranges of data read from NetCDF files. This includes verifying data types, value ranges, and consistency with expected schemas.
    - Anomaly Detection: There are no anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual or suspicious patterns in the input data that could signal malicious manipulation. This could include statistical checks for outliers or unexpected data distributions.
    - Data Integrity Checks: The project does not implement data integrity checks such as checksums or digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the input data files, and to verify that they have not been tampered with.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs the ability to create or modify NetCDF input files that are subsequently processed by the `inference.py` script.
    - In a real-world scenario, this could involve compromising data feeds, intercepting data transmissions, or gaining access to systems where input data is stored or generated.
    - For a test scenario, the attacker can create a modified NetCDF file locally and provide its path to the inference script.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/inference.py`
        - Function: `read_sample_file_and_norm_input(params, file_path, hold_out_obs_ratio=0.2)`
            ```python
            ds = xr.open_dataset(file_path, engine="netcdf4")
            ```
            - The code directly opens and reads data from the provided NetCDF file path without any prior validation of the file's contents or structure.
            - It extracts data variables based on configuration parameters like `params.inp_hrrr_vars`, `params.inp_obs_vars`, `params.inp_satelite_vars`, and `params.field_tar_vars`.
            - The extracted data is then normalized using functions like `min_max_norm_ignore_extreme_fill_nan`.
            - **Vulnerability:** The lack of input validation at this stage means that if a malicious NetCDF file is provided, the system will process it as if it were legitimate data. An attacker can inject arbitrary numerical values or manipulate existing data within the NetCDF structure, which the system will then normalize and feed into the model.

    - File: `/code/utils/data_loader_multifiles.py`
        - Function: `_min_max_norm_ignore_extreme_fill_nan(self, data, vmin, vmax)`
        - Function: `_min_max_norm(data, vmin, vmax)` (if used based on config - not in current config)
            - These normalization functions, while correctly implementing normalization, operate on the data provided to them without questioning its validity or source.
            - If malicious data is provided, these functions will normalize the malicious data just as they would with legitimate data, thus propagating the malicious input further into the system.

    - File: `/code/inference.py`
        - Function: `inference(...)`
            ```python
            inp = torch.tensor(inp[np.newaxis, :, :, :]).to(device, dtype=torch.float)
            inp_sate_norm = torch.tensor(inp_sate_norm[np.newaxis, :, :, :, :]).to(device, dtype=torch.float)
            # ...
            gen = model(inp) # or gen = model(inp, inp_sate)
            ```
            - The normalized input data (`inp`, `inp_sate_norm`) is converted to PyTorch tensors and directly fed into the ADAF model for inference.
            - The model itself, defined in `/code/models/encdec.py`, is designed for weather forecasting and does not include any input sanitization or validation logic. It processes the numerical input it receives as intended data.

        - Visualization:
        ```
        [Malicious NetCDF File] --> (/code/inference.py) read_sample_file_and_norm_input --> [Unvalidated & Normalized Malicious Data] --> [ADAF Model] --> [Manipulated Weather Forecast Output]
        ```
- Security test case:
    1. Prepare Malicious NetCDF File:
        - Locate a valid test NetCDF input file in the `./data/test/` directory. For example, use `2022-10-01_00.nc`.
        - Use a tool like `ncdump` to inspect the structure and data of the NetCDF file:
          ```bash
          ncdump -h /code/data/test/2022-10-01_00.nc > original_header.cdl
          ncdump -v sta_t /code/data/test/2022-10-01_00.nc > original_data.txt # Example for sta_t variable
          ```
        - Modify the `sta_t` variable within the NetCDF file to inject malicious data. For example, set all `sta_t` values to an unrealistically high temperature like 373.15 (100 degrees Celsius) across all locations and time windows. You can use `ncgen` and `nco` tools or Python libraries like `netCDF4` to modify the NetCDF file.
        - Example using `netCDF4` in Python:
          ```python
          import netCDF4
          import numpy as np
          file_path = '/code/data/test/2022-10-01_00.nc'
          dataset = netCDF4.Dataset(file_path, 'r+')
          sta_t_var = dataset.variables['sta_t']
          sta_t_var[:] = 373.15 # Set all sta_t values to 373.15 K (100 C)
          dataset.close()
          print(f"Modified {file_path} by setting sta_t to 373.15K")
          ```
        - Save the modified NetCDF file, overwriting the original or saving it as a new file (e.g., `malicious_2022-10-01_00.nc`).

    2. Run Inference with Malicious Input:
        - Execute the `inference.py` script, pointing `--test_data_path` to the directory containing the modified NetCDF file. If you created a new file, ensure only the malicious file is in the test data path, or adjust the script to target the specific malicious file.
          ```bash
          export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' # or appropriate GPU device
          nohup python -u inference.py \
              --seed=0 \
              --exp_dir='./exp/' \
              --test_data_path='./data/test' \ # or path to directory with malicious file
              --net_config='EncDec' \
              --hold_out_obs_ratio=0.3 \
              > malicious_inference.log 2>&1 &
          ```
          Note: If you replaced the original file, ensure you have a backup. If you created a new malicious file, you might need to adjust the `inference.py` script or the test data path to ensure it processes this specific file. For simplicity in this test case, we assume you've replaced the original test file.

    3. Analyze the Output Forecasts:
        - After inference completes, examine the output NetCDF file generated in the experiment directory (e.g., `./exp/inference_ensemble_*_hold_*/2022-10-01_00.nc`).
        - Open the output NetCDF file and visualize or analyze the predicted variables, particularly `ai_gen_t` (generated temperature).
        - Compare the predicted temperature (`ai_gen_t`) with the background HRRR temperature (`bg_hrrr_t`) and the RTMA target temperature (`rtma_t`) within the output file.
        - Check if the injected high temperature values in `sta_t` have influenced the generated forecast, causing `ai_gen_t` to show unrealistically high temperatures, especially in regions where station observations are influential.
        - Compare these forecasts to those generated using the original, unmodified input file to clearly demonstrate the impact of the malicious data injection.

    4. Verify Vulnerability:
        - If the generated forecast (`ai_gen_t`) shows a significant and unrealistic increase in temperature due to the injected malicious `sta_t` data, and this deviation is clearly attributable to the manipulated input, then the Input Data Injection vulnerability is confirmed.
        - For example, if `ai_gen_t` displays temperatures close to or above 100 degrees Celsius in areas where such temperatures are not meteorologically plausible given the background HRRR and target RTMA data, and this is a direct result of the injected 100-degree station data, the vulnerability is validated.

====================================================================================================

### - Vulnerability name: Missing Rate Limiting for Inference Requests
- Description: The inference service lacks rate limiting. An attacker could flood the service with numerous inference requests, exceeding computational resources and causing performance degradation or service unavailability. Step-by-step trigger:
    1. The attacker identifies the endpoint for submitting inference requests (e.g., an HTTP API endpoint if the inference is exposed as a service).
    2. The attacker uses a script or tool to send a high volume of inference requests to this endpoint in a short period.
    3. The server attempts to process all requests without any rate limiting mechanism.
    4. Server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are exhausted.
    5. Legitimate users experience slow response times or service outages.
- Impact: Denial of service, performance degradation, and potential service unavailability for legitimate users.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations: Implement rate limiting on the inference request endpoint to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given time frame.
- Preconditions:
    - The inference functionality must be exposed as a service accessible over a network (e.g., via HTTP API).
    - The service must not have any rate limiting mechanisms in place.
- Source code analysis:
    - The provided code repository focuses on the ML model and inference script (`inference.py`), not service deployment. Rate limiting is typically implemented at the API gateway or web server level (e.g., using Nginx, Apache, or API management tools), which is outside the scope of this repository.  Therefore, source code analysis within this repository will not reveal rate limiting implementations (or lack thereof). The vulnerability is in the deployment architecture, not the Python code itself.
- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the ADAF inference as a service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI to create an API around `inference.py`). Assume it's deployed at `http://<server_ip>:<port>/infer`.
    2. Use a load testing tool like `ab` (Apache Benchmark) or `locust` to send a high number of concurrent requests to the inference endpoint. For example, using `ab`:
       ```bash
       ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://<server_ip>:<port>/infer
       ```
       `-n 1000`: Send 1000 total requests.
       `-c 100`: Send 100 concurrent requests at a time.
    3. Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) during the test. Observe if the server becomes overloaded, response times increase significantly, or the service becomes unresponsive.
    4. If resource usage spikes and performance degrades significantly under load without request throttling, it confirms the absence of rate limiting and the vulnerability.

### - Vulnerability name: Missing Input Validation in NetCDF File Processing
- Description:
    1. The ADAF framework processes weather data from NetCDF files, primarily using the `xarray` library's `xr.open_dataset` function in `data_loader_multifiles.py` and `inference.py`.
    2. The application code does not implement explicit validation of the structure or content of the input NetCDF files. It assumes that the files adhere to a predefined format, including specific variables and dimensions as described in `/code/data/README.md`.
    3. An attacker can supply a maliciously crafted NetCDF file that deviates from the expected format. This file could contain unexpected data types, malformed metadata, or variables with extremely large or specially crafted values.
    4. When `xr.open_dataset` attempts to parse this malicious file, or when the application code subsequently processes the loaded data (e.g., during normalization or model inference), it may trigger vulnerabilities in the `xarray` or underlying `netCDF4` libraries, or in the application's data processing logic due to unexpected data.
    5. If a vulnerability is triggered, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the underlying libraries or the Python interpreter itself are susceptible to exploits based on malformed NetCDF input.

- Impact:
    - High. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the ADAF application. An attacker could gain complete control over the system, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting operations.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not include any input validation or sanitization for NetCDF files beyond what is implicitly handled by the `xarray` and `netCDF4` libraries.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation should be implemented to verify that the NetCDF files conform to the expected schema. This should include checks for:
        - Expected variables and their data types.
        - Valid dimensions and their ranges.
        - Metadata integrity and absence of malicious metadata.
        - File size limits to prevent excessive resource consumption.
    - Error handling should be improved to gracefully handle invalid NetCDF files and prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.
    - Consider using secure NetCDF parsing practices, if available, within the `xarray` library or by using alternative safer libraries if `xarray` is known to have vulnerabilities.
    - Implement sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential exploits, even if input validation is bypassed.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious NetCDF file to the ADAF application. This could be achieved if the application processes user-uploaded files, reads files from an external or network location that is accessible to the attacker, or if the attacker can somehow modify the data files used by the application. In the context of the described attack vector, this is achieved by providing the malicious file as input to the training or inference scripts.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/data_loader_multifiles.py` and `/code/inference.py`**
        - Both files use the following code snippet to open NetCDF files:
          ```python
          ds = xr.open_dataset(file_path, engine="netcdf4")
          ```
        - There is no preceding or subsequent code that validates the content of `ds` or the `file_path` itself to ensure it's a safe NetCDF file.
        - In `getdataset` function of `/code/data_loader_multifiles.py`, the code directly accesses variables from the opened dataset `ds` without checking if they exist:
          ```python
          inp_hrrr = np.array(
              self.files[hour_idx][self.params.inp_hrrr_vars].to_array()
          )[:, : self.params.img_size_y, : self.params.img_size_x]
          ```
          If `self.params.inp_hrrr_vars` contains variable names that are not present in the malicious NetCDF file, `xarray` might raise an exception, but this is not a robust security mitigation and could still lead to denial of service or expose internal error information. More critically, if a variable *does* exist but has unexpected content (e.g., wrong data type or shape), subsequent processing steps could be vulnerable.
        - Similar unchecked access patterns are present for `inp_obs_vars`, `inp_satelite_vars`, `field_tar_vars`, and topography variable 'z'.
        - Array slicing `[:, : self.params.img_size_y, : self.params.img_size_x]` assumes that the dimensions in the NetCDF file are at least as large as `params.img_size_y` and `params.img_size_x`. A malicious file with smaller dimensions might cause indexing errors, although these are less likely to be code execution vulnerabilities.
        - **Visualization:**
          ```mermaid
          graph LR
              A[Start: train.py/inference.py] --> B(Load Config: experiment.yaml);
              B --> C{Input File Path: test_data_path/train_data_path};
              C --> D[data_loader_multifiles.py/inference.py];
              D --> E(xr.open_dataset(file_path, engine='netcdf4'));
              E --> F{NetCDF File Parsing & Data Loading};
              F --> G(Data Processing & Model Input);
              G --> H[Model Execution];
              F -- Malicious NetCDF --> I[Potential Vulnerability in xarray/netCDF4 or Data Processing Logic];
              I --> J{Arbitrary Code Execution?};
              J --> K[Impact];
          ```
          The visualization shows the flow from input file path to NetCDF parsing and highlights the point where a malicious NetCDF file could introduce a vulnerability during parsing or subsequent data processing before model execution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious NetCDF File:** Create a NetCDF file named `malicious.nc` with the following characteristics to test for vulnerabilities:
        - Include a variable with an excessively long name (e.g., 2048 characters).
        - Include a variable with an unexpected data type, such as a string type when a numerical type is expected (e.g., for 'hrrr_t' which is expected to be numerical).
        - Include malformed metadata, such as excessively long attribute values or attributes with special characters that might cause parsing issues.
        - (Optional, if known vulnerabilities exist in `xarray` or `netCDF4` for specific malformed NetCDF structures): Craft the file to specifically trigger a known vulnerability in these libraries.
    2. **Place the Malicious File:** Place the `malicious.nc` file in the directory that is used as the test data path. For example, if `test_data_path` in `config/experiment.yaml` is set to `./data/test`, place `malicious.nc` in `./data/test/`.
    3. **Run Inference Script with Malicious File:** Execute the `inference.py` script, ensuring that it is configured to use the `malicious.nc` file as input. For example, using the command line as described in `/code/README.md` but potentially modifying `--test_data_path` argument if needed to point to the directory containing `malicious.nc`:
       ```shell
       export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0'
       nohup python -u inference.py \
           --seed=0 \
           --exp_dir='./exp/' \
           --test_data_path='./data/test' \ # Ensure this points to directory with malicious.nc
           --net_config='EncDec' \
           --hold_out_obs_ratio=0.3 \
           > inference_malicious.log 2>&1 &
       ```
    4. **Analyze the Results:**
        - Check the `inference_malicious.log` file for any error messages, stack traces, or unexpected program behavior.
        - Monitor the system for any signs of unusual activity, such as unexpected processes being launched, network connections being established, or file system modifications, which could indicate code execution.
        - If the application crashes, note the type of crash and the error message. While crashes are not the primary target, they indicate a vulnerability in handling malicious input and could be a stepping stone to identifying more severe vulnerabilities.
        - If the application continues to run but produces incorrect or nonsensical output, this also indicates a problem with input validation, though it may be a lower severity issue if it doesn't lead to code execution.
    5. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation):** If the test successfully triggers a code execution vulnerability, the system may exhibit signs of compromise as described in step 4. If it causes a crash or significant errors during NetCDF parsing or data processing, it confirms the lack of robust input validation and the potential for exploitation. If the application processes the file without any apparent issues (less likely with a genuinely malicious file), further investigation into more specific types of NetCDF vulnerabilities or deeper code analysis might be needed.
