### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Unconditional Fallback to Default Credentials when Fallback Enabled

- Description:
    1. A developer initializes the `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` with the `fallback_enabled` option set to `True`.
    2. The developer configures S3 Access Grants with the intention of strictly controlling access to S3 resources through grants. They might mistakenly believe that `fallback_enabled=True` only activates fallback when Access Grants is not applicable or encounters an error in retrieving credentials.
    3. However, when `fallback_enabled` is set to `True`, the plugin unconditionally falls back to the default S3 client's credentials if it fails to retrieve Access Grants credentials for *any* reason, including scenarios where no explicit Access Grant covers the requested resource. This means that even if Access Grants *could* have been the sole authorization mechanism, the plugin defaults to the potentially broader permissions of the underlying S3 client when a grant isn't found.
    4. Consequently, if the S3 client is configured with IAM roles or credentials that have broader permissions than the developer intended to grant through Access Grants, an attacker can bypass the intended fine-grained access control of Access Grants and gain unintended access to S3 resources by exploiting this fallback behavior. This is especially critical if developers assume Access Grants is the *only* authorization layer when `fallback_enabled=True` is active.
    5. When `fallback_enabled` is set to `True` during plugin initialization, the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` method in `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` always returns `True` if `fallback_enabled` is `True`.
    6. Consequently, in the `_get_access_grants_credentials` method, if any exception occurs during the Access Grants credential retrieval process (or even if no exception occurs but the fallback is enabled), the code will always bypass the Access Grants logic and proceed with the default S3 client credentials.
    7. This effectively disables the intended Access Grants enforcement, allowing access based on the default credentials associated with the S3 client, even when Access Grants should restrict access.
    8. An attacker can exploit this by simply ensuring `fallback_enabled=True` is used when the plugin is configured, which might be the default or a common configuration practice, especially for users who want to ensure compatibility with operations not supported by Access Grants without fully understanding the security implications.

- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to S3 resources. If `fallback_enabled` is set to `True`, the plugin will not enforce Access Grants permissions, and access will be determined solely by the default credentials configured on the S3 client. This bypasses the fine-grained access control provided by Access Grants, potentially leading to significant data breaches or unauthorized operations on S3 buckets.
    - Potential data breaches or data leaks if sensitive data is exposed due to overly permissive fallback behavior.
    - Risk of unauthorized data manipulation or deletion if the fallback credentials have write or delete permissions on the S3 resources.
    - Circumvention of the intended security posture established by Access Grants, leading to a false sense of security.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `fallback_enabled` option is implemented as a configuration choice, but its 'True' setting inherently creates this vulnerability.
    - The `README.md` file describes the `fallback_enabled` option, explaining that setting it to `True` will "fall back every time we are not able to get the credentials from Access Grants, no matter the reason."
    - The documentation implicitly warns about the broader fallback behavior, but it might not be prominent enough to prevent misconfigurations by developers who misunderstand the security implications.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove or significantly alter the behavior of `fallback_enabled=True`. If fallback is always enabled, the plugin essentially becomes a passthrough and does not provide the intended security benefits of Access Grants enforcement.
    - If fallback is needed for unsupported operations, the fallback logic should be refined to only trigger for `UnsupportedOperationError` when `fallback_enabled=False`, and only when absolutely necessary. It should not unconditionally fallback simply because `fallback_enabled=True`.
    - Clearly document the security implications of `fallback_enabled=True` and strongly discourage its use in production environments where Access Grants enforcement is desired. Highlight that setting it to `True` effectively disables Access Grants protection.
    - **Stronger emphasis in documentation:**  The documentation should explicitly highlight the security risks of enabling `fallback_enabled=True` and strongly advise developers to use `fallback_enabled=False` unless they fully understand and intend to rely on the fallback behavior. It should warn against the false sense of security that `fallback_enabled=True` might create when developers intend Access Grants to be the sole authorization mechanism.
    - **Code-level warning:** Consider adding a warning message in the code itself (e.g., logging a warning during plugin initialization when `fallback_enabled=True`) to alert developers about the potential security implications of this setting.
    - **Consider alternative fallback behavior:** Evaluate if a more nuanced fallback mechanism is possible, where fallback only occurs in truly exceptional scenarios (e.g., service errors within Access Grants) rather than simply when a grant is not found.  Alternatively, provide clearer guidance on how to configure the S3 client's default credentials to be least-privileged if fallback is enabled.

- Preconditions:
    - The S3 Access Grants plugin must be initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
    - The attacker needs to influence the configuration of the plugin to ensure `fallback_enabled=True`. This could be through social engineering, misconfiguration, or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application that uses this plugin to set the plugin configuration.
    - The `aws-s3-access-grants-boto3-plugin` is installed and configured in a Python application.
    - The S3 client used by the plugin is configured with default credentials (e.g., IAM role attached to the instance or access keys) that have broader S3 permissions than what is intended through Access Grants.
    - S3 Access Grants are configured to restrict access to certain S3 resources, but these restrictions are intended to be the primary or sole access control mechanism.
    - An attacker can trigger S3 operations through the application that are not explicitly allowed by Access Grants but are permitted by the default S3 client credentials due to the fallback being enabled.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`

    ```python
    def __init__(self, s3_client, fallback_enabled, customer_session=None):
        # ...
        self.fallback_enabled = fallback_enabled
        # ...

    def _get_access_grants_credentials(self, operation_name, request, **kwargs):
        # ...
        try:
            # ... Access Grants credential retrieval logic ...
        except Exception as e:
            if self._should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e):
                pass # Fallback to default credentials
            else:
                raise e

    def _should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e):
        if e.__class__.__name__ == 'UnsupportedOperationError':
            logging.debug(
                "Operation not supported by S3 access grants. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        if self.fallback_enabled: # Vulnerable condition: always true if fallback_enabled is True
            logging.debug("Fall back enabled on the plugin. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        return False
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow**:
        1. The `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` is initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        2. When an S3 operation is performed, the `_get_access_grants_credentials` method is invoked.
        3. Inside `_get_access_grants_credentials`, if any exception occurs during Access Grants credential retrieval (or even if no exception occurs and the code just reaches the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` check because of enabled fallback), the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` method is called.
        4. In `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case`, because `self.fallback_enabled` is `True`, this condition `if self.fallback_enabled:` evaluates to `True`.
        5. The method returns `True`, indicating that fallback should occur.
        6. In `_get_access_grants_credentials`, the `if` condition `if self._should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e):` is met, and the `pass` statement is executed, effectively bypassing the Access Grants credentials and using the default S3 client credentials.

    **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [S3 Client Call] --> S3AccessGrantsPlugin._get_access_grants_credentials
        --> try:
            --> ... (Attempt to get Access Grants credentials)
        --> except Exception as e:
            --> if S3AccessGrantsPlugin._should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e):
                --> if fallback_enabled == True:
                    --> RETURN TRUE (Fallback will occur)
                --> else:
                    --> ... (Check for UnsupportedOperationError - less relevant to this vuln)
            --> else:
                --> RAISE EXCEPTION
    [If Fallback Occurs (TRUE returned)] --> Default S3 Client Credentials Used --> [Potentially Broader Access]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure you have an S3 bucket registered with Access Grants and an IAM role with Access Grants configured, as set up by `test_setup.py` in the integration tests. Also, ensure you have default AWS credentials configured that would normally allow access to the unregistered bucket (for example, through an IAM user or instance profile with broad S3 permissions).
    2. **Setup**: Modify the `test_plugin.py` to include a new test case. In this test case, create an S3 client with `fallback_enabled=True`.
    3. **Action**: Attempt to access an object in an S3 bucket that is *not* registered with Access Grants (e.g., `unregistered_bucket_name` from `test_setup.py`) using the S3 client created in step 2. Use an operation that would normally be checked by Access Grants (e.g., `get_object`).
    4. **Expected Result**: The request should succeed (HTTP status code 200). This is because, with `fallback_enabled=True`, the plugin should bypass Access Grants and use the default credentials, which (as per precondition) are assumed to have general S3 access.
    5. **Verification**: Assert that the HTTP status code of the response is 200. This confirms that the plugin fell back to default credentials and allowed access, even though Access Grants were not evaluated and would not have granted access (as the bucket is unregistered).

    ```python
        def test_fallback_always_enabled_bypass_access_grants(self):
            self.createS3Client(enable_fallback=True) # Initialize plugin with fallback_enabled=True
            response = self.s3_client.get_object(Bucket=self.test_setup.unregistered_bucket_name, Key=self.test_setup.TEST_OBJECT_1)
            self.assertEqual(response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'], 200) # Expect success due to fallback
    ```
    6. **Cleanup**: No specific cleanup needed for this test case beyond the general test suite teardown.

    **Security Test Case for Misconfiguration Scenario:**

    **Preconditions for Test:**
    1.  An AWS account is required to run this test.
    2.  The `aws-s3-access-grants-boto3-plugin` is installed.
    3.  An IAM role or user with broad S3 permissions (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess` or similar, for testing purposes only - in a real-world scenario, this would be the overly permissive default credentials) is configured as the default credentials for the boto3 session (e.g., instance profile, environment variables, or AWS config file).
    4.  S3 Access Grants are configured for a specific bucket, but intentionally *no grant* is created for a specific prefix within that bucket for the test principal.
    5.  Two S3 buckets are needed:
        -   `registered_bucket_name`:  This bucket has an Access Grants Location configured.
        -   `unregistered_bucket_name`: This bucket does *not* have an Access Grants Location configured and represents a resource where Access Grants should *not* grant access, but default credentials might.

    **Steps:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        -   Ensure the test environment meets the preconditions (AWS account, plugin installed, overly permissive default credentials, Access Grants configured for `registered_bucket_name` but no grant for the test prefix).
        -   Create the `registered_bucket_name` and `unregistered_bucket_name` S3 buckets.
        -   Put a test object (`test_object.txt`) into `unregistered_bucket_name`.

    2.  **Test with `fallback_enabled=True`:**
        -   Initialize a boto3 session.
        -   Create an S3 client using `session.create_client('s3')`.
        -   Instantiate `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` with `fallback_enabled=True` and register it with the S3 client:
            ```python
            plugin = S3AccessGrantsPlugin(s3_client, fallback_enabled=True, customer_session=session)
            plugin.register()
            ```
        -   Attempt to get the object `test_object.txt` from `unregistered_bucket_name` using the plugin-enhanced S3 client:
            ```python
            response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=unregistered_bucket_name, Key='test_object.txt')
            ```
        -   **Expected Result:** The `get_object` call should succeed (HTTP status code 200) because `fallback_enabled=True` causes the plugin to fall back to the overly permissive default S3 client credentials, which *do* allow access to `unregistered_bucket_name`.

    3.  **Test with `fallback_enabled=False` (Control Case):**
        -   Initialize a new boto3 session (or reset the existing one).
        -   Create a new S3 client.
        -   Instantiate `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` with `fallback_enabled=False` and register it:
            ```python
            plugin = S3AccessGrantsPlugin(s3_client, fallback_enabled=False, customer_session=session)
            plugin.register()
            ```
        -   Attempt to get the same object `test_object.txt` from `unregistered_bucket_name`:
            ```python
            try:
                response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=unregistered_bucket_name, Key='test_object.txt')
            except ClientError as e:
                client_error = e
            ```
        -   **Expected Result:** The `get_object` call should fail with a `ClientError` and an HTTP status code 403 (Access Denied) or similar. This is because `fallback_enabled=False` prevents fallback, and since there's no Access Grant for `unregistered_bucket_name`, access should be denied.

    4.  **Teardown:**
        -   Delete the test object from `unregistered_bucket_name`.
        -   Delete the `registered_bucket_name` and `unregistered_bucket_name` S3 buckets.
        -   Clean up any Access Grants test configurations if necessary.

#### Vulnerability Name: Inconsistent Prefix Handling in Common Prefix Calculation

- Description: The `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function calculates a common prefix for a list of object keys in operations like `DeleteObjects` and `CopyObject`. In certain scenarios, especially when object keys have diverse prefix structures or when the list of prefixes is empty, this function may incorrectly return an overly broad common prefix, such as "/", or an incorrect common prefix. This can lead to the plugin requesting Access Grants credentials for a broader S3 prefix than intended. If an Access Grant exists at this broader prefix, the plugin might unintentionally use Access Grants credentials even when a more specific grant should not apply, or when no grant should apply at all for the specific objects being accessed.
- Impact: Potential for unintended access to S3 objects. If a broad Access Grant is configured at a higher prefix level (e.g., at the bucket root), an attacker might be able to gain access to objects for which they should not have permissions, by crafting requests that lead to an overly broad common prefix calculation. This could bypass the intended fine-grained access control provided by S3 Access Grants.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented to address this vulnerability in the provided code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Improve the logic within the `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function to ensure accurate common prefix calculation across various prefix structures and edge cases, including empty prefix lists. The function should be robust enough to handle diverse input and avoid returning overly broad prefixes when not appropriate.
    - Implement unit tests specifically targeting the `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function with a wide range of prefix combinations, including edge cases and scenarios that could lead to incorrect calculations. These tests should verify the function's output for correctness and prevent regressions.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to trigger `DeleteObjects` or `CopyObject` operations with a set of object keys that, when processed by `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes`, result in an incorrect or overly broad common prefix.
    - An Access Grant must exist at a broader prefix level that unintentionally covers the overly broad calculated prefix.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`
    - Function: `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes(self, prefixes)`

    ```python
    def _get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes(self, prefixes):
        if len(prefixes) == 0:
            return '/'
        common_ancestor = first_key = prefixes[0]
        last_prefix = ''
        for prefix in prefixes[1:]:
            while common_ancestor != "":
                if not prefix.startswith(common_ancestor):
                    last_index = common_ancestor.rfind('/')
                    if last_index == -1:
                        return "/"
                    last_prefix = common_ancestor[last_index + 1:]
                    common_ancestor = common_ancestor[:last_index]
                else:
                    break
        new_common_ancestor = common_ancestor + "/" + last_prefix
        for prefix in prefixes:
            while last_prefix != "":
                if not prefix.startswith(new_common_ancestor):
                    last_prefix = last_prefix[0:-1]
                    new_common_ancestor = common_ancestor + "/" + last_prefix
                else:
                    break
        if new_common_ancestor == first_key + "/":
            return "/" + first_key
        return "/" + new_common_ancestor
    ```
    - **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
        1. An attacker initiates a `DeleteObjects` or `CopyObject` operation. For `DeleteObjects`, the attacker crafts a request with `Delete.Objects` containing keys that will lead to an incorrect common prefix. For `CopyObject`, the attacker manipulates the `CopySource` and `Key` parameters.
        2. The `_get_s3_prefix` function is called, which in turn calls `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` with the list of object keys.
        3. Due to the logic in `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes`, an overly broad prefix (e.g., "/") is returned. For example, if prefixes are `["folderA/file1.txt", "folderB/file2.txt"]`, the function might incorrectly return `/folder`.
        4. The plugin requests Access Grants credentials for the overly broad prefix (e.g., `s3://bucket/folder`).
        5. If an Access Grant exists at `s3://bucket/` (root of the bucket) or `s3://bucket/folder`, even if it shouldn't apply to `folderA/file1.txt` and `folderB/file2.txt` specifically based on more granular grants, the plugin might use these credentials.
        6. The operation proceeds with potentially unintended Access Grants credentials, potentially granting unauthorized access.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup:
        - Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `test-bucket-prefix-vuln`).
        - Register the bucket with Access Grants.
        - Create an Access Grant at the bucket root (`s3://test-bucket-prefix-vuln`) with READ permission for a test IAM role (attacker role).
        - Do not create any more specific grants.
        - Ensure fallback is disabled in the plugin configuration (`fallback_enabled=False`).
        - Create an S3 client with the plugin registered and using attacker role credentials.
    - Step 2: Trigger Vulnerability:
        - Attempt to delete multiple objects with keys that will result in an incorrect common prefix. For example, use keys like `["object1.txt", "folderA/object2.txt"]` in `test-bucket-prefix-vuln`.
        - Call `s3_client.delete_objects(Bucket='test-bucket-prefix-vuln', Delete={'Objects': [{'Key': 'object1.txt'}, {'Key': 'folderA/object2.txt'}]})`.
    - Step 3: Verify Vulnerability:
        - The `delete_objects` operation should succeed because the plugin might incorrectly calculate the common prefix as "/" or similar, and use the root-level Access Grant.
        - Expected behavior: The operation should be denied (403 Forbidden) because there is no specific grant for these objects, and fallback is disabled.
        - If the operation succeeds (HTTP status 200 or 204), the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### Vulnerability Name: Fallback on Any Exception (Too Broad)

- Description: The plugin's fallback mechanism, controlled by the `fallback_enabled` flag, is too broadly defined. The `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` function currently triggers fallback not only for `UnsupportedOperationError` (which is intended) but also for *any* other exception that might occur during the process of retrieving Access Grants credentials. This is insecure because an attacker could potentially induce various errors (e.g., by manipulating network conditions, causing timeouts, or triggering errors in AWS services the plugin depends on) to force the plugin to fallback to the default S3 client credentials, effectively bypassing Access Grants even when it should be enforced.
- Impact: Bypassing S3 Access Grants permission checks. By triggering an arbitrary exception during the credential retrieval process, an attacker can force the plugin to ignore Access Grants and rely on the potentially less restrictive default credentials configured on the S3 client. This could lead to unauthorized access to S3 resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations exist to prevent fallback on arbitrary exceptions. The `fallback_enabled` flag controls fallback behavior in a binary manner (either fallback for certain conditions OR fallback for all exceptions if enabled).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Refine the exception handling logic in `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case`. Instead of falling back for any exception when `fallback_enabled=True`, the function should be modified to fallback only for a specific set of expected and safe-to-fallback exceptions, such as `UnsupportedOperationError` or specific, transient service errors that genuinely indicate Access Grants is not applicable or temporarily unavailable.
    - Introduce more granular control over fallback behavior. Instead of a simple boolean flag, consider allowing configuration of specific exception types that should trigger fallback, or different fallback modes (e.g., fallback only for unsupported operations, fallback for transient errors, no fallback).
- Preconditions:
    - The `fallback_enabled` option must be set to `True` when initializing the `S3AccessGrantsPlugin`.
    - The attacker needs to be able to induce an exception during the execution of the `_get_access_grants_credentials` function, specifically in the part where it attempts to retrieve Access Grants credentials (e.g., during calls to S3 Control service).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`
    - Function: `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e)`

    ```python
    def _should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e):
        if e.__class__.__name__ == 'UnsupportedOperationError':
            logging.debug(
                "Operation not supported by S3 access grants. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        if self.fallback_enabled:
            logging.debug("Fall back enabled on the plugin. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        return False
    ```
    - **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
        1. The plugin is initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        2. An attacker initiates any S3 operation that is intercepted by the plugin.
        3. During the execution of `_get_access_grants_credentials`, the attacker somehow causes an exception to be raised. This could be simulated in a test environment by mocking network errors, service timeouts, or invalid responses from the S3 Control client. In a real-world scenario, this might be harder to reliably trigger but still represents a potential vulnerability if environmental factors or service instability can lead to exceptions.
        4. The `_get_access_grants_credentials` function catches this exception and calls `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e)`.
        5. Because `fallback_enabled` is `True`, `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` returns `True` for *any* exception `e`.
        6. The plugin proceeds with the default S3 client credentials, bypassing the intended Access Grants check.
        7. If the default credentials have broader permissions than what Access Grants would have allowed, the attacker might gain unauthorized access.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup:
        - Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `test-bucket-fallback-vuln`).
        - Register the bucket with Access Grants (though not strictly necessary for this test to demonstrate fallback bypass).
        - Configure default S3 client credentials with permissions that would normally be restricted by Access Grants (e.g., broader S3 permissions).
        - Initialize the `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        - Mock or simulate a condition that reliably throws an exception within `_get_access_grants_credentials` during the call to retrieve Access Grants credentials. For example, mock the `s3_control_client.get_data_access` call to raise a `ClientError` with a generic error code (not AccessDenied or UnsupportedOperation).
    - Step 2: Trigger Vulnerability:
        - Attempt to perform an S3 operation that *should* be governed by Access Grants (e.g., `get_object` on a registered bucket, assuming no explicit grant is set up for the default credentials).
        - Call `s3_client.get_object(Bucket='test-bucket-fallback-vuln', Key='test-object.txt')`.
    - Step 3: Verify Vulnerability:
        - The operation should succeed because the plugin should fallback to default credentials due to the induced exception.
        - Expected behavior *without* the vulnerability: If Access Grants were properly enforced and fallback only happened for intended reasons, and assuming no Access Grant allows access with default credentials, the operation should be denied (403 Forbidden) if default credentials alone are insufficient.
        - If the operation succeeds (HTTP status 200), it confirms that the fallback mechanism is too broad and allows bypassing Access Grants upon encountering arbitrary exceptions.

#### Vulnerability Name: Potential Cache Inconsistency due to Prefix Normalization

- Description:
    - The plugin normalizes S3 prefixes when storing Access Grants credentials in the cache. Specifically, in the `_process_matched_target` function within `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/cache/access_grants_cache.py`, it removes the trailing "/*" from a `matchedGrantTarget`.
    - This normalization aims to handle grants defined at the prefix level (e.g., `s3://bucket/prefix/*`).
    - However, there's a potential for inconsistency in how S3 prefixes are handled during cache lookups, especially when object keys in subsequent requests contain variations like double slashes (`//`) or dot slashes (`/.//`).
    - Step-by-step scenario to trigger the vulnerability:
        1. An attacker has legitimate access to S3 bucket and prefix covered by an Access Grant defined as `s3://bucket/prefix/*`.
        2. The attacker makes an initial request (e.g., `GetObject`) to an object within the granted prefix, like `s3://bucket/prefix/object1.txt`.
        3. The plugin correctly retrieves Access Grants credentials and caches them, likely under the normalized prefix `s3://bucket/prefix`.
        4. The attacker then crafts a subsequent request to an object with a slightly altered prefix, for example, `s3://bucket/prefix//object2.txt` (using a double slash).
        5. Due to potential inconsistencies in prefix handling within the cache lookup mechanism, the plugin might fail to recognize this request as being covered by the previously cached credentials.
        6. This could lead to a cache miss, causing the plugin to bypass the cache and potentially re-evaluate Access Grants or, in some configurations, fall back to default credentials unnecessarily.
- Impact:
    - Performance degradation: Cache misses lead to repeated calls to the Access Grants service, increasing latency and potentially AWS service costs.
    - Unexpected Fallback Behavior: In configurations where fallback is enabled, cache misses might trigger unintended fallback to default S3 client credentials, even when Access Grants should be applicable. This could lead to inconsistent access control behavior.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Caching of Access Grants credentials in `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/cache/access_grants_cache.py`.
    - Caching of Access Denied responses in `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/cache/access_denied_cache.py`.
    - Prefix normalization in `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/cache/access_grants_cache.py` using `_process_matched_target`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust prefix normalization during cache key construction for both storing and retrieving credentials. This should ensure consistent handling of prefixes with variations like double slashes, dot slashes, and trailing slashes.
    - Comprehensive security test cases specifically designed to validate cache behavior with different prefix formats and ensure cache hits as expected, even with minor variations in object keys.
- Preconditions:
    - The aws-s3-access-grants-boto3-plugin is installed and registered with a boto3 S3 client.
    - Caching mechanisms within the plugin are active (default behavior).
    - An Access Grant is configured for a prefix at the S3 bucket (e.g., `s3://bucket/prefix/*`).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/cache/access_grants_cache.py`:
        - `_process_matched_target(matched_grant_target)`: This function normalizes the `matchedGrantTarget` by removing trailing "/*", potentially leading to a normalized prefix in the cache (lines 101-104).
        - `get_credentials(s3_control_client, cache_key, account_id, access_denied_cache)`: This function handles cache lookups and service calls. It uses `_search_credentials_at_prefix_level` and `_search_credentials_at_character_level` for cache retrieval (lines 111-132).
        - `_search_credentials_at_prefix_level(cache_key)`: This function iteratively shortens the `s3_prefix` in the `cache_key` for cache lookups, potentially with different prefix normalization compared to how prefixes are stored (lines 50-58).
    - `aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`:
        - `_get_s3_prefix(operation_name, request)`: This function constructs the `s3_prefix` from the incoming request parameters. The way it handles different S3 operations and extracts prefixes needs to be consistent with cache key construction.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Access Grant:** In an AWS account with S3 Access Grants enabled, create an Access Grant for `s3://<your_registered_bucket_name>/testprefix/*` with `READ` permission, granting access to the IAM role being used for testing. Replace `<your_registered_bucket_name>` with a bucket you control and have registered as an Access Grants location.
    2. **Initialize S3 Client with Plugin:**
       ```python
       import botocore.session
       from aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin.s3_access_grants_plugin import S3AccessGrantsPlugin

       session = botocore.session.get_session()
       s3_client = session.create_client('s3')
       plugin = S3AccessGrantsPlugin(s3_client, fallback_enabled=False) # fallback disabled to clearly see Access Grant issues
       plugin.register()
       ```
    3. **Initial Request (Cache Population):**
       ```python
       bucket_name = "<your_registered_bucket_name>" # Use the same bucket name as in step 1
       key_object1 = "testprefix/object1.txt"
       try:
           response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key_object1)
           print(f"GetObject {key_object1} - Success: {response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"GetObject {key_object1} - Error: {e}")
           raise
       ```
    4. **Subsequent Request with Double Slash (Potential Cache Miss):**
       ```python
       key_object2 = "testprefix//object2.txt" # Double slash in the key
       try:
           response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key_object2)
           print(f"GetObject {key_object2} - Success: {response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']}")
       except Exception as e:
           # Check if the error indicates Access Denied unexpectedly, which might suggest a cache miss leading to incorrect authorization.
           print(f"GetObject {key_object2} - Error: {e}")
           print(f"Error details: {e}")
       ```
    5. **Analyze Results:**
        - Examine the output of both `GetObject` calls.
        - If both requests succeed with HTTP status 200, the cache might be working correctly in this specific scenario.
        - **To confirm cache behavior more thoroughly, you would need to add logging or debugging to the `AccessGrantsCache` class to track cache hits and misses.**  Ideally, after the first successful request (`object1.txt`), the second request (`object2.txt`) should be a cache hit. If the second request triggers a new call to the Access Grants service (which you could observe through logging or network monitoring if available in your testing environment), it would indicate a cache miss and the potential vulnerability.
    6. **Repeat with other prefix variations:** Test with keys like `"testprefix/.//object3.txt"`, `"testprefix/./object4.txt"` and other variations to explore the robustness of prefix normalization and cache lookup.
