- Vulnerability Name: Unconditional Fallback to Default Credentials when Fallback Enabled

- Description:
    1. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to S3 resources if the plugin is initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`, regardless of whether Access Grants should be enforced or not.
    2. When `fallback_enabled` is set to `True` during plugin initialization, the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` method in `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` always returns `True` if `fallback_enabled` is `True`.
    3. Consequently, in the `_get_access_grants_credentials` method, if any exception occurs during the Access Grants credential retrieval process (or even if no exception occurs but the fallback is enabled), the code will always bypass the Access Grants logic and proceed with the default S3 client credentials.
    4. This effectively disables the intended Access Grants enforcement, allowing access based on the default credentials associated with the S3 client, even when Access Grants should restrict access.
    5. An attacker can exploit this by simply ensuring `fallback_enabled=True` is used when the plugin is configured, which might be the default or a common configuration practice, especially for users who want to ensure compatibility with operations not supported by Access Grants without fully understanding the security implications.

- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to S3 resources. If `fallback_enabled` is set to `True`, the plugin will not enforce Access Grants permissions, and access will be determined solely by the default credentials configured on the S3 client. This bypasses the fine-grained access control provided by Access Grants, potentially leading to significant data breaches or unauthorized operations on S3 buckets.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `fallback_enabled` option is implemented as a configuration choice, but its 'True' setting inherently creates this vulnerability.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove or significantly alter the behavior of `fallback_enabled=True`. If fallback is always enabled, the plugin essentially becomes a passthrough and does not provide the intended security benefits of Access Grants enforcement.
    - If fallback is needed for unsupported operations, the fallback logic should be refined to only trigger for `UnsupportedOperationError` when `fallback_enabled=False`, and only when absolutely necessary. It should not unconditionally fallback simply because `fallback_enabled=True`.
    - Clearly document the security implications of `fallback_enabled=True` and strongly discourage its use in production environments where Access Grants enforcement is desired. Highlight that setting it to `True` effectively disables Access Grants protection.

- Preconditions:
    - The S3 Access Grants plugin must be initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
    - The attacker needs to influence the configuration of the plugin to ensure `fallback_enabled=True`. This could be through social engineering, misconfiguration, or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application that uses this plugin to set the plugin configuration.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`

    ```python
    def __init__(self, s3_client, fallback_enabled, customer_session=None):
        # ...
        self.fallback_enabled = fallback_enabled
        # ...

    def _get_access_grants_credentials(self, operation_name, request, **kwargs):
        # ...
        try:
            # ... Access Grants credential retrieval logic ...
        except Exception as e:
            if self._should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e):
                pass # Fallback to default credentials
            else:
                raise e

    def _should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e):
        if e.__class__.__name__ == 'UnsupportedOperationError':
            logging.debug(
                "Operation not supported by S3 access grants. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        if self.fallback_enabled: # Vulnerable condition: always true if fallback_enabled is True
            logging.debug("Fall back enabled on the plugin. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        return False
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow**:
        1. The `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` is initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        2. When an S3 operation is performed, the `_get_access_grants_credentials` method is invoked.
        3. Inside `_get_access_grants_credentials`, if any exception occurs during Access Grants credential retrieval (or even if no exception occurs and the code just reaches the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` check because of enabled fallback), the `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` method is called.
        4. In `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case`, because `self.fallback_enabled` is `True`, this condition `if self.fallback_enabled:` evaluates to `True`.
        5. The method returns `True`, indicating that fallback should occur.
        6. In `_get_access_grants_credentials`, the `if` condition `if self._should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e):` is met, and the `pass` statement is executed, effectively bypassing the Access Grants credentials and using the default S3 client credentials.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure you have an S3 bucket registered with Access Grants and an IAM role with Access Grants configured, as set up by `test_setup.py` in the integration tests. Also, ensure you have default AWS credentials configured that would normally allow access to the unregistered bucket (for example, through an IAM user or instance profile with broad S3 permissions).
    2. **Setup**: Modify the `test_plugin.py` to include a new test case. In this test case, create an S3 client with `fallback_enabled=True`.
    3. **Action**: Attempt to access an object in an S3 bucket that is *not* registered with Access Grants (e.g., `unregistered_bucket_name` from `test_setup.py`) using the S3 client created in step 2. Use an operation that would normally be checked by Access Grants (e.g., `get_object`).
    4. **Expected Result**: The request should succeed (HTTP status code 200). This is because, with `fallback_enabled=True`, the plugin should bypass Access Grants and use the default credentials, which (as per precondition) are assumed to have general S3 access.
    5. **Verification**: Assert that the HTTP status code of the response is 200. This confirms that the plugin fell back to default credentials and allowed access, even though Access Grants were not evaluated and would not have granted access (as the bucket is unregistered).

```python
    def test_fallback_always_enabled_bypass_access_grants(self):
        self.createS3Client(enable_fallback=True) # Initialize plugin with fallback_enabled=True
        response = self.s3_client.get_object(Bucket=self.test_setup.unregistered_bucket_name, Key=self.test_setup.TEST_OBJECT_1)
        self.assertEqual(response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'], 200) # Expect success due to fallback
```
    6. **Cleanup**: No specific cleanup needed for this test case beyond the general test suite teardown.

This test case, when added to `test_plugin.py` and executed, will demonstrate that setting `fallback_enabled=True` completely bypasses Access Grants enforcement and relies solely on default S3 client credentials, confirming the vulnerability.
