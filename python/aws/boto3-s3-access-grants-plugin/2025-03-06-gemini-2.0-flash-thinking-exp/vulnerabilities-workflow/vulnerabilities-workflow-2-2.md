### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Inconsistent Prefix Handling in Common Prefix Calculation
- Description: The `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function calculates a common prefix for a list of object keys in operations like `DeleteObjects` and `CopyObject`. In certain scenarios, especially when object keys have diverse prefix structures or when the list of prefixes is empty, this function may incorrectly return an overly broad common prefix, such as "/", or an incorrect common prefix. This can lead to the plugin requesting Access Grants credentials for a broader S3 prefix than intended. If an Access Grant exists at this broader prefix, the plugin might unintentionally use Access Grants credentials even when a more specific grant should not apply, or when no grant should apply at all for the specific objects being accessed.
- Impact: Potential for unintended access to S3 objects. If a broad Access Grant is configured at a higher prefix level (e.g., at the bucket root), an attacker might be able to gain access to objects for which they should not have permissions, by crafting requests that lead to an overly broad common prefix calculation. This could bypass the intended fine-grained access control provided by S3 Access Grants.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented to address this vulnerability in the provided code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Improve the logic within the `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function to ensure accurate common prefix calculation across various prefix structures and edge cases, including empty prefix lists. The function should be robust enough to handle diverse input and avoid returning overly broad prefixes when not appropriate.
    - Implement unit tests specifically targeting the `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` function with a wide range of prefix combinations, including edge cases and scenarios that could lead to incorrect calculations. These tests should verify the function's output for correctness and prevent regressions.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to trigger `DeleteObjects` or `CopyObject` operations with a set of object keys that, when processed by `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes`, result in an incorrect or overly broad common prefix.
    - An Access Grant must exist at a broader prefix level that unintentionally covers the overly broad calculated prefix.

    - Function: `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes(self, prefixes)`

    ```python
    def _get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes(self, prefixes):
        if len(prefixes) == 0:
            return '/'
        common_ancestor = first_key = prefixes[0]
        last_prefix = ''
        for prefix in prefixes[1:]:
            while common_ancestor != "":
                if not prefix.startswith(common_ancestor):
                    last_index = common_ancestor.rfind('/')
                    if last_index == -1:
                        return "/"
                    last_prefix = common_ancestor[last_index + 1:]
                    common_ancestor = common_ancestor[:last_index]
                else:
                    break
        new_common_ancestor = common_ancestor + "/" + last_prefix
        for prefix in prefixes:
            while last_prefix != "":
                if not prefix.startswith(new_common_ancestor):
                    last_prefix = last_prefix[0:-1]
                    new_common_ancestor = common_ancestor + "/" + last_prefix
                else:
                    break
        if new_common_ancestor == first_key + "/":
            return "/" + first_key
        return "/" + new_common_ancestor
    ```
    - **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
        1. An attacker initiates a `DeleteObjects` or `CopyObject` operation. For `DeleteObjects`, the attacker crafts a request with `Delete.Objects` containing keys that will lead to an incorrect common prefix. For `CopyObject`, the attacker manipulates the `CopySource` and `Key` parameters.
        2. The `_get_s3_prefix` function is called, which in turn calls `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes` with the list of object keys.
        3. Due to the logic in `_get_common_prefix_for_multiple_prefixes`, an overly broad prefix (e.g., "/") is returned. For example, if prefixes are `["folderA/file1.txt", "folderB/file2.txt"]`, the function might incorrectly return `/folder`.
        4. The plugin requests Access Grants credentials for the overly broad prefix (e.g., `s3://bucket/folder`).
        5. If an Access Grant exists at `s3://bucket/` (root of the bucket) or `s3://bucket/folder`, even if it shouldn't apply to `folderA/file1.txt` and `folderB/file2.txt` specifically based on more granular grants, the plugin might use these credentials.
        6. The operation proceeds with potentially unintended Access Grants credentials, potentially granting unauthorized access.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup:
        - Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `test-bucket-prefix-vuln`).
        - Register the bucket with Access Grants.
        - Create an Access Grant at the bucket root (`s3://test-bucket-prefix-vuln`) with READ permission for a test IAM role (attacker role).
        - Do not create any more specific grants.
        - Ensure fallback is disabled in the plugin configuration (`fallback_enabled=False`).
        - Create an S3 client with the plugin registered and using attacker role credentials.
    - Step 2: Trigger Vulnerability:
        - Attempt to delete multiple objects with keys that will result in an incorrect common prefix. For example, use keys like `["object1.txt", "folderA/object2.txt"]` in `test-bucket-prefix-vuln`.
        - Call `s3_client.delete_objects(Bucket='test-bucket-prefix-vuln', Delete={'Objects': [{'Key': 'object1.txt'}, {'Key': 'folderA/object2.txt'}]})`.
    - Step 3: Verify Vulnerability:
        - The `delete_objects` operation should succeed because the plugin might incorrectly calculate the common prefix as "/" or similar, and use the root-level Access Grant.
        - Expected behavior: The operation should be denied (403 Forbidden) because there is no specific grant for these objects, and fallback is disabled.
        - If the operation succeeds (HTTP status 200 or 204), the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Fallback on Any Exception (Too Broad)
- Description: The plugin's fallback mechanism, controlled by the `fallback_enabled` flag, is too broadly defined. The `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` function currently triggers fallback not only for `UnsupportedOperationError` (which is intended) but also for *any* other exception that might occur during the process of retrieving Access Grants credentials. This is insecure because an attacker could potentially induce various errors (e.g., by manipulating network conditions, causing timeouts, or triggering errors in AWS services the plugin depends on) to force the plugin to fallback to the default S3 client credentials, effectively bypassing Access Grants even when it should be enforced.
- Impact: Bypassing S3 Access Grants permission checks. By triggering an arbitrary exception during the credential retrieval process, an attacker can force the plugin to ignore Access Grants and rely on the potentially less restrictive default credentials configured on the S3 client. This could lead to unauthorized access to S3 resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations exist to prevent fallback on arbitrary exceptions. The `fallback_enabled` flag controls fallback behavior in a binary manner (either fallback for certain conditions OR fallback for all exceptions if enabled).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Refine the exception handling logic in `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case`. Instead of falling back for any exception when `fallback_enabled=True`, the function should be modified to fallback only for a specific set of expected and safe-to-fallback exceptions, such as `UnsupportedOperationError` or specific, transient service errors that genuinely indicate Access Grants is not applicable or temporarily unavailable.
    - Introduce more granular control over fallback behavior. Instead of a simple boolean flag, consider allowing configuration of specific exception types that should trigger fallback, or different fallback modes (e.g., fallback only for unsupported operations, fallback for transient errors, no fallback).
- Preconditions:
    - The `fallback_enabled` option must be set to `True` when initializing the `S3AccessGrantsPlugin`.
    - The attacker needs to be able to induce an exception during the execution of the `_get_access_grants_credentials` function, specifically in the part where it attempts to retrieve Access Grants credentials (e.g., during calls to S3 Control service).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/aws_s3_access_grants_boto3_plugin/s3_access_grants_plugin.py`
    - Function: `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e)`

    ```python
    def _should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(self, e):
        if e.__class__.__name__ == 'UnsupportedOperationError':
            logging.debug(
                "Operation not supported by S3 access grants. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        if self.fallback_enabled:
            logging.debug("Fall back enabled on the plugin. Falling back to evaluate permission through policies.")
            return True
        return False
    ```
    - **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
        1. The plugin is initialized with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        2. An attacker initiates any S3 operation that is intercepted by the plugin.
        3. During the execution of `_get_access_grants_credentials`, the attacker somehow causes an exception to be raised. This could be simulated in a test environment by mocking network errors, service timeouts, or invalid responses from the S3 Control client. In a real-world scenario, this might be harder to reliably trigger but still represents a potential vulnerability if environmental factors or service instability can lead to exceptions.
        4. The `_get_access_grants_credentials` function catches this exception and calls `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case(e)`.
        5. Because `fallback_enabled` is `True`, `_should_fallback_to_default_credentials_for_this_case` returns `True` for *any* exception `e`.
        6. The plugin proceeds with the default S3 client credentials, bypassing the intended Access Grants check.
        7. If the default credentials have broader permissions than what Access Grants would have allowed, the attacker might gain unauthorized access.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup:
        - Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `test-bucket-fallback-vuln`).
        - Register the bucket with Access Grants (though not strictly necessary for this test to demonstrate fallback bypass).
        - Configure default S3 client credentials with permissions that would normally be restricted by Access Grants (e.g., broader S3 permissions).
        - Initialize the `S3AccessGrantsPlugin` with `fallback_enabled=True`.
        - Mock or simulate a condition that reliably throws an exception within `_get_access_grants_credentials` during the call to retrieve Access Grants credentials. For example, mock the `s3_control_client.get_data_access` call to raise a `ClientError` with a generic error code (not AccessDenied or UnsupportedOperation).
    - Step 2: Trigger Vulnerability:
        - Attempt to perform an S3 operation that *should* be governed by Access Grants (e.g., `get_object` on a registered bucket, assuming no explicit grant is set up for the default credentials).
        - Call `s3_client.get_object(Bucket='test-bucket-fallback-vuln', Key='test-object.txt')`.
    - Step 3: Verify Vulnerability:
        - The operation should succeed because the plugin should fallback to default credentials due to the induced exception.
        - Expected behavior *without* the vulnerability: If Access Grants were properly enforced and fallback only happened for intended reasons, and assuming no Access Grant allows access with default credentials, the operation should be denied (403 Forbidden) if default credentials alone are insufficient.
        - If the operation succeeds (HTTP status 200), it confirms that the fallback mechanism is too broad and allows bypassing Access Grants upon encountering arbitrary exceptions.
