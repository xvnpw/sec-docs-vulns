Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you would like me to filter and update. I need the list of vulnerabilities to be able to process them according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Filter** the vulnerabilities based on your inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on prompt injection attack vector and high/critical severity.
2.  **Format** the valid vulnerabilities in a markdown list, keeping the existing descriptions for each vulnerability (name, description, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, security test case).
3.  **Return** the markdown list of valid vulnerabilities or an empty list if no vulnerabilities meet the criteria.

Looking forward to receiving the list of vulnerabilities!
