- vulnerability name: Potential Server-Side Template Injection Vulnerability in Intrinsic Function Processing
  description: |
    The AWS SAM transform processes SAM templates, which can include intrinsic functions like `Fn::If`, `Fn::Sub`, and `Fn::FindInMap`. If these intrinsic functions are not handled securely during template processing, a maliciously crafted SAM template could inject code that gets executed during the CloudFormation template generation.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious SAM template containing a Serverless Application Model resource that utilizes intrinsic functions in a way that could be exploited for SSTI.
    2. The threat actor deploys this malicious SAM template using the AWS SAM CLI or directly through AWS CloudFormation, targeting an AWS environment where the AWS SAM transform is enabled.
    3. The AWS SAM transform attempts to process the template, including the potentially malicious intrinsic functions.
    4. If the SAM transform is vulnerable, the malicious payload within the intrinsic function could be interpreted and executed by the template engine during the transformation process, leading to Server-Side Template Injection.
  impact: |
    Successful Server-Side Template Injection could allow a threat actor to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the AWS environment by manipulating the generated CloudFormation template.
    - Deploy unintended AWS resources or modify existing resources, leading to security misconfigurations or resource manipulation.
    - Potentially escalate privileges within the AWS environment, depending on the permissions of the IAM role used by the SAM transform.
  vulnerability rank: High
  currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are mentioned in the provided PROJECT FILES.
  missing mitigations: |
    - Input validation and sanitization for all template inputs, especially within intrinsic functions, to prevent injection of malicious code.
    - Secure processing of intrinsic functions to avoid unintended code execution during template transformation.
    - Security audits and code reviews of the template processing logic, focusing on areas that handle intrinsic functions and user-provided template inputs.
  preconditions: |
    - The threat actor needs to be able to provide a custom SAM template to be processed by the AWS SAM transform.
    - The AWS SAM transform must be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection in its intrinsic function processing logic.
  source code analysis: |
    Further source code analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact code locations responsible for processing intrinsic functions (like `Fn::If`, `Fn::Sub`, and `Fn::FindInMap`) within the `aws-sam-translator` project.
    - Examine the `samtranslator/translator/translator.py` file, as mentioned in `DESIGN.md` as the entry point.
    - Analyze the code paths that handle `AWS::Serverless::*` resources and their properties, particularly those that involve template processing and intrinsic function resolution.
    - Investigate how the `samtranslator/model` package handles properties and their validation, as vulnerabilities might arise from improper validation or processing of user-provided values within templates.
    - Look for code sections that dynamically construct or execute code based on template inputs, as these are prime locations for SSTI vulnerabilities.
    - Review test files like `test_function_resources.py`, `test_logical_id_generator.py`, and `tests/openapi/test_openapi.py` to understand how inputs and intrinsic functions are handled in tests, which might give hints to potential vulnerable areas in the main code.
    - Analyze `samtranslator/translator/logical_id_generator.py` to understand how logical IDs are generated, especially when intrinsic functions are involved, as this might highlight areas where user-controlled data is processed.
  security test case: |
    1. Create a malicious SAM template (template.yaml) that includes a Serverless::Function resource with a property that uses a potentially vulnerable intrinsic function, for example `Fn::Sub`, to inject a payload.
    2. Example malicious SAM template (template.yaml):
       ```yaml
       Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
       Resources:
         MaliciousFunction:
           Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
           Properties:
             Runtime: python3.9
             Handler: index.handler
             InlineCode: !Sub
               - |
                 import os
                 def handler(event, context):
                   os.system("whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt") # Malicious payload to write output of 'whoami' command to /tmp/pwned.txt
                   return {
                     'statusCode': 200,
                     'body': 'Template processed'
                   }
       ```
    3. Deploy the template using AWS SAM CLI: `sam deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name ssti-test --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`
    4. After deployment, check the CloudFormation stack and Lambda function configuration.
    5. Verify if the CloudFormation template generated by SAM transform contains the injected payload.
    6. Invoke the Lambda function.
    7. Examine the execution environment of the Lambda function (e.g., using AWS Lambda logs or by checking /tmp directory if possible) to see if the `whoami` command was executed and the `/tmp/pwned.txt` file was created.
    8. If the `whoami` command was executed and the file exists, it indicates a potential Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability.
