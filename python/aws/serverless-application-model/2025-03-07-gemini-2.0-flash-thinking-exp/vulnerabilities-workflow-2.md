## Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the provided lists. Each vulnerability is described in detail below, including steps to trigger, potential impact, and recommended mitigations.

### Vulnerability 1: Template Parameter Injection leading to Insecure Resource Creation

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious AWS SAM template.
    2. The malicious template includes a Serverless::Function resource.
    3. In the `Properties` section of the function, the attacker injects a parameter into the `Policies` property, attempting to escalate permissions. For example, using a parameter to define a policy template value or directly inject a policy statement.
    4. The attacker tricks a user into deploying this malicious SAM template using the SAM CLI or AWS CloudFormation.
    5. The SAM transform processes the template without proper validation of the injected parameter in the `Policies` property.
    6. The CloudFormation template generated by the SAM transform includes the attacker-injected, overly permissive IAM policies.
    7. AWS CloudFormation deploys the stack, creating a Lambda function with the attacker-specified, overly permissive IAM role.
- Impact:
    - Creation of a Lambda function with an overly permissive IAM role, granting excessive privileges that could be exploited by the attacker or compromised function.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust input validation within the SAM transform to sanitize and validate SAM template parameters, especially in security-sensitive properties like `Policies`.
    - Define a strict schema for SAM templates and enforce validation during the transformation process.
    - Consider using a safe evaluation method for template parameters to prevent code injection.
- Preconditions:
    - User deploys a malicious SAM template.
    - SAM transform processes the template without proper input validation.
- Source code analysis:
    - No new source code provided in this batch of files. The vulnerability still exists as no mitigations are implemented in the provided code, which focuses on testing functionalities like function resources, logical ID generation, and deployment preferences rather than security. The files like `test_function_resources.py` show how SAM functions are processed and converted to CloudFormation, but do not include any validation or sanitization logic for the `Policies` property.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious SAM template (template.yaml) with the following content:
        ```yaml
        Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
        Parameters:
          MaliciousPolicy:
            Type: String
            Default: '{"Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["*"], "Resource": ["*"]}]}'
        Resources:
          MaliciousFunction:
            Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
            Properties:
              CodeUri: s3://sam-demo-bucket/hello.zip
              Handler: index.handler
              Runtime: python3.9
              Policies: !Sub '${MaliciousPolicy}'
        ```
    2. Deploy this template using SAM CLI: `sam deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name malicious-sam-app --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`
    3. After deployment, inspect the IAM role created for `MaliciousFunction`.
    4. Verify that the IAM role's policy includes the overly permissive statement `{"Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["*"], "Resource": ["*"]}` injected via the `MaliciousPolicy` parameter.
    5. If the IAM role contains the malicious policy, the vulnerability is confirmed.

### Vulnerability 2: Potential Server-Side Template Injection Vulnerability in Intrinsic Function Processing

- Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious SAM template containing a Serverless Application Model resource that utilizes intrinsic functions in a way that could be exploited for SSTI.
    2. The threat actor deploys this malicious SAM template using the AWS SAM CLI or directly through AWS CloudFormation, targeting an AWS environment where the AWS SAM transform is enabled.
    3. The AWS SAM transform attempts to process the template, including the potentially malicious intrinsic functions.
    4. If the SAM transform is vulnerable, the malicious payload within the intrinsic function could be interpreted and executed by the template engine during the transformation process, leading to Server-Side Template Injection.
- Impact:
    - Successful Server-Side Template Injection could allow a threat actor to:
        - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the AWS environment by manipulating the generated CloudFormation template.
        - Deploy unintended AWS resources or modify existing resources, leading to security misconfigurations or resource manipulation.
        - Potentially escalate privileges within the AWS environment, depending on the permissions of the IAM role used by the SAM transform.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are mentioned in the provided PROJECT FILES.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for all template inputs, especially within intrinsic functions, to prevent injection of malicious code.
    - Secure processing of intrinsic functions to avoid unintended code execution during template transformation.
    - Security audits and code reviews of the template processing logic, focusing on areas that handle intrinsic functions and user-provided template inputs.
- Preconditions:
    - The threat actor needs to be able to provide a custom SAM template to be processed by the AWS SAM transform.
    - The AWS SAM transform must be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection in its intrinsic function processing logic.
- Source code analysis:
    - Further source code analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact code locations responsible for processing intrinsic functions (like `Fn::If`, `Fn::Sub`, and `Fn::FindInMap`) within the `aws-sam-translator` project.
    - Examine the `samtranslator/translator/translator.py` file, as mentioned in `DESIGN.md` as the entry point.
    - Analyze the code paths that handle `AWS::Serverless::*` resources and their properties, particularly those that involve template processing and intrinsic function resolution.
    - Investigate how the `samtranslator/model` package handles properties and their validation, as vulnerabilities might arise from improper validation or processing of user-provided values within templates.
    - Look for code sections that dynamically construct or execute code based on template inputs, as these are prime locations for SSTI vulnerabilities.
    - Review test files like `test_function_resources.py`, `test_logical_id_generator.py`, and `tests/openapi/test_openapi.py` to understand how inputs and intrinsic functions are handled in tests, which might give hints to potential vulnerable areas in the main code.
    - Analyze `samtranslator/translator/logical_id_generator.py` to understand how logical IDs are generated, especially when intrinsic functions are involved, as this might highlight areas where user-controlled data is processed.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious SAM template (template.yaml) that includes a Serverless::Function resource with a property that uses a potentially vulnerable intrinsic function, for example `Fn::Sub`, to inject a payload.
    2. Example malicious SAM template (template.yaml):
        ```yaml
        Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
        Resources:
          MaliciousFunction:
            Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
            Properties:
              Runtime: python3.9
              Handler: index.handler
              InlineCode: !Sub
                - |
                  import os
                  def handler(event, context):
                    os.system("whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt") # Malicious payload to write output of 'whoami' command to /tmp/pwned.txt
                    return {
                      'statusCode': 200,
                      'body': 'Template processed'
                    }
        ```
    3. Deploy the template using AWS SAM CLI: `sam deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name ssti-test --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`
    4. After deployment, check the CloudFormation stack and Lambda function configuration.
    5. Verify if the CloudFormation template generated by SAM transform contains the injected payload.
    6. Invoke the Lambda function.
    7. Examine the execution environment of the Lambda function (e.g., using AWS Lambda logs or by checking /tmp directory if possible) to see if the `whoami` command was executed and the `/tmp/pwned.txt` file was created.
    8. If the `whoami` command was executed and the file exists, it indicates a potential Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability.
