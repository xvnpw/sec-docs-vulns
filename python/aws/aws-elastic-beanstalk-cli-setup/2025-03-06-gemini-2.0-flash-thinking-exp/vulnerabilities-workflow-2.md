### Combined Vulnerability List

This list combines identified vulnerabilities, removing duplicates and focusing on high and critical severity issues that are realistic to exploit.

#### Unverified Download of Installer Script (Supply Chain Vulnerability)
- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a modified version of the `ebcli_installer.py` script, embedding malicious code.
    2. The attacker distributes this malicious script through unofficial channels such as compromised websites, phishing emails, or file sharing platforms, tricking users into downloading it.
    3. A user, intending to install the EB CLI, unknowingly downloads the malicious script instead of the legitimate one from the official AWS repository.
    4. The user executes the downloaded malicious script.
    5. The malicious script executes arbitrary code with the user's privileges, potentially leading to a full system compromise, malware installation, or data theft. This vulnerability is the foundation for other exploitation methods described below as it compromises the initial installation process.
- Impact:
    - Full system compromise due to arbitrary code execution.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors, leading to persistent access for the attacker.
    - Data theft and credential compromise, including potential AWS credentials.
    - Lateral movement within the user's network if the compromised system is part of a larger network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There are no mechanisms in place to verify the integrity of the `ebcli_installer.py` script before execution. The project provides the script via a public GitHub repository without integrity checks or warnings against downloading from untrusted sources.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of the `ebcli_installer.py` script before execution.
        - **Checksum Verification:** Provide a checksum (e.g., SHA256) of the official `ebcli_installer.py` script on the official AWS documentation page or project website, allowing users to manually verify the downloaded script.
        - **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign the `ebcli_installer.py` script to provide a higher level of assurance of its origin and integrity. The script itself or a separate verification tool could check this signature.
    - **Clear Security Warnings:** Add prominent warnings in the README.md, official documentation, and any download locations, explicitly instructing users to:
        - Only download the `ebcli_installer.py` script from the official AWS GitHub repository or AWS website.
        - Verify the authenticity of the download source.
        - Be extremely cautious of downloading the script from any other location.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to distribute a modified `ebcli_installer.py` script through untrusted channels.
    - A user must be deceived into downloading and executing the malicious script.
    - The user must have Python installed to execute the script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `ebcli_installer.py` script is designed to be directly executed by users and performs actions with user privileges, such as creating directories, downloading packages using `pip`, and modifying file permissions.
    - The script lacks any built-in input validation or integrity checks to confirm its legitimacy.
    - Attackers can insert malicious code at any point in the script to perform arbitrary actions upon execution.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Script:** Create a modified `ebcli_installer.py` that creates a file named `malicious_file.txt` in the user's temporary directory to demonstrate arbitrary code execution.
        ```python
        import tempfile
        import os
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            malicious_file_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'malicious_file.txt')
            with open(malicious_file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write('This file was created by a malicious installer script.')
            print(f"Malicious file created at: {malicious_file_path}")
            # ... rest of the original script's main execution logic ...
        ```
    2. **Host the Malicious Script:**  Save the malicious script locally as `malicious_installer.py`. In a real scenario, an attacker would host this online.
    3. **Prepare a Test Environment:** Use a test machine to simulate a victim's system.
    4. **Execute the Malicious Script:** On the test machine, run the malicious script: `python malicious_installer.py`.
    5. **Verify Malicious Activity:** Check if `malicious_file.txt` exists in the user's temporary directory.
    - **Expected Result:** The file `malicious_file.txt` should be present, confirming arbitrary code execution from the modified installer script.

#### Malicious Package Installation via Compromised Installer Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the `ebcli_installer.py` script (as described in the "Unverified Download of Installer Script" vulnerability).
    2. The attacker modifies the `_install_ebcli` function within the script.
    3. Instead of installing the legitimate `awsebcli` package from PyPI, the compromised script is altered to install a malicious package. This could be from a malicious repository, a local path, or even a package with a similar name to `awsebcli` (typosquatting).
    4. A user, tricked into using the compromised installer, executes the script.
    5. The script creates a virtual environment and uses `pip` to install the attacker's malicious package instead of `awsebcli`.
    6. The malicious package can contain arbitrary code that executes during installation or when the user attempts to use the EB CLI, leading to system compromise.
- Impact:
    - Installation of malware disguised as the EB CLI on the victim's system.
    - Data theft and unauthorized access to sensitive information, including potential AWS credentials handled by the EB CLI.
    - Complete compromise of the user's system, allowing the attacker to perform any action with the user's privileges.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not currently implement any measures to prevent malicious package installation via a compromised installer script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check of Installer Script:** As described in the "Unverified Download of Installer Script" vulnerability, this is crucial.
    - **Dependency Verification:** While not directly mitigating the compromised installer, implementing checks on the installed `awsebcli` package after installation could provide a layer of defense, though this is less effective than securing the installer itself.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully compromise the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    - The attacker must trick a user into downloading and executing the compromised script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is located in the `_install_ebcli` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
    - ```python
      @Step('Installing EBCLI')
      def _install_ebcli(quiet, version, ebcli_source):
          # ...
          if ebcli_source:
              install_args = ['pip', 'install', '{}'.format(ebcli_source.strip())]
          elif version:
              install_args = ['pip', 'install', 'awsebcli=={}'.format(version.strip())]
          else:
              install_args = [
                  'pip', 'install', 'awsebcli',
                  '--upgrade',
                  '--upgrade-strategy', 'eager',
              ]
          returncode = _exec_cmd(install_args, quiet)
          # ...
      ```
    - An attacker can modify the `install_args` list to change the package name from `'awsebcli'` to a malicious package name or path, causing `pip` to install the attacker's package.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious package**: Create a Python package `evil_package` with malicious code in `__init__.py`.
        ```python
        # evil_package/__init__.py
        import os
        os.system('echo "Malicious code executed from evil_package!" > /tmp/evil_package_executed.txt')
        ```
        Create `setup.py` for `evil_package`.
    2. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`**: In `_install_ebcli`, change the `else` block to install `evil_package`.
        ```python
        else:
            install_args = [
                'pip', 'install', 'evil_package', # Changed from 'awsebcli'
                '--upgrade',
                '--upgrade-strategy', 'eager',
            ]
        ```
    3. **Distribute modified script**: Make the modified `ebcli_installer.py` available to a test user, along with the `evil_package` (e.g., in the same directory or a local PyPI server).
    4. **Victim user execution**: Run the modified `ebcli_installer.py`.
    5. **Verify malicious activity**: Check for `/tmp/evil_package_executed.txt`. Its presence confirms malicious code execution.

#### Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Installer Script in Wrapper Scripts
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    2. The attacker modifies the `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` function or the `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS` dictionary within the script.
    3. The attacker injects malicious code into the templates used to generate wrapper scripts (`eb`, `eb.ps1`, `eb.bat`). This code can be designed to execute before or after the legitimate EB CLI command.
    4. A user, tricked into using the compromised installer, executes the script.
    5. The compromised script generates wrapper scripts containing the injected malicious code.
    6. When the user subsequently uses the `eb` command (via the wrapper script), the malicious code is executed, leading to arbitrary code execution every time the `eb` command is used.
- Impact:
    - Persistent arbitrary code execution on the user's system whenever the `eb` command is invoked.
    - Potential for persistent malware installation, ongoing data theft, and long-term system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. No measures are in place to prevent the generation of compromised wrapper scripts from a malicious installer.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check of Installer Script**: Essential to prevent the initial compromise.
    - **Secure Script Generation**: While the primary risk is the compromised installer, secure coding practices in script generation could minimize injection risks if the installer itself were partially compromised.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must compromise `ebcli_installer.py`.
    - The attacker must trick a user into running the compromised script.
    - The user must add the installation directory to their PATH and use the `eb` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` and `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS` in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
    - ```python
      EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS = {
          'bat': '\n'.join([...]),
          'ps1': '\n'.join([...]),
          'py': """#!/usr/bin/env python
      import subprocess
      import sys

      # ...

      exit(_exec_cmd(['{bin_location}/eb'] + sys.argv[1:]))
      """
      }

      @Step('Creating EB wrappers')
      def _generate_ebcli_wrappers(virtualenv_location):
          # ...
          if sys.platform.startswith('win32'):
              # ...
          else:
              with open(ebcli_script_path, 'w') as script:
                  script.write(_python_script_body(virtualenv_location))
              _exec_cmd(['chmod', '+x', ebcli_script_path], False)
      ```
    - Attackers can modify `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS['py']` to inject code before `exit(_exec_cmd(...))`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`**: Edit `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS['py']` to inject code creating `.malicious_file` in the user's home directory.
        ```python
        EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS = {
            'py': """#!/usr/bin/env python
        import subprocess
        import sys
        import os
        with open(os.path.expanduser("~/.malicious_file"), "w") as f:
            f.write("Malicious code executed!")
        # ... rest of the script ...
        exit(_exec_cmd(['{bin_location}/eb'] + sys.argv[1:]))
        """
        }
        ```
    2. **Distribute modified script**.
    3. **Victim user execution**: Run modified `ebcli_installer.py`. Add `executables` to PATH.
    4. **Execute `eb` command**: Run `eb --version`.
    5. **Verify malicious activity**: Check for `.malicious_file` in the home directory.

#### Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Virtual Environment Activation Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    2. The modified script replaces the legitimate `activate_this.py` script in the virtual environment with a malicious version.
    3. When `ebcli_installer.py` activates the virtual environment using `_activate_virtualenv`, it executes the attacker's malicious `activate_this.py` script.
    4. This results in arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges during the installation process itself.
- Impact:
    - Immediate arbitrary code execution upon running the compromised installer.
    - Potential for full system compromise, malware installation, data theft, and other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There are no safeguards against replacing `activate_this.py` with a malicious script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check of Installer Script**: Prevents the distribution of the malicious installer in the first place.
    - **Embed Activation Logic**: Instead of relying on external `activate_this.py`, embed the virtual environment activation logic directly within the installer script to avoid executing external scripts.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must be tricked into downloading and running a compromised `ebcli_installer.py`.
    - The user must have Python and `virtualenv` installed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in `_activate_virtualenv` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
    - ```python
      @Step('Activating virtualenv')
      def _activate_virtualenv(virtualenv_location):
          # ...
          activate_this_path = os.path.join(
              virtualenv_location,
              VIRTUALENV_DIR_NAME,
              activate_script_directory,
              'activate_this.py'
          )

          if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
              execfile(activate_this_path, dict(__file__=activate_this_path))
          else:
              exec(open(activate_this_path).read(), dict(__file__=activate_this_path))
      ```
    - The script directly executes `activate_this.py` without any validation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare malicious `activate_this.py`**: Create `malicious_activate_this.py` that creates `/tmp/pwned.txt`.
        ```python
        # malicious_activate_this.py
        import os
        with open("/tmp/pwned.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("Exploited via malicious activate_this.py!")
        print("Malicious activate_this.py executed!")
        ```
    2. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`**: In `_create_virtualenv`, inject code to replace `activate_this.py` with `malicious_activate_this.py` after virtual environment creation.
        ```python
        # ... after _exec_cmd(virtualenv_args, quiet) and before _add_ebcli_stamp ...
        import shutil
        import os
        malicious_activate_this_source = os.path.abspath("malicious_activate_this.py")
        activate_this_destination_dir = os.path.join(virtualenv_directory, '.ebcli-virtual-env', 'bin')
        activate_this_destination = os.path.join(activate_this_destination_dir, 'activate_this.py')
        shutil.copyfile(malicious_activate_this_source, activate_this_destination)
        print(f"Malicious activate_this.py injected to: {activate_this_destination}")
        ```
    3. **Place `malicious_activate_this.py`** in the same directory as modified `ebcli_installer.py`.
    4. **Run modified `ebcli_installer.py`**: `python ./ebcli_installer.py`.
    5. **Check for exploitation**: Verify `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists.
