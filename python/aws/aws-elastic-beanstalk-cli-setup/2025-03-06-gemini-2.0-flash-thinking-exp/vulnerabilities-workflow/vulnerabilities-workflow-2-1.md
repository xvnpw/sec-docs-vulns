### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Package Installation via Compromised Installer Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    2. The attacker modifies the `_install_ebcli` function within the script.
    3. Instead of installing the legitimate `awsebcli` package from PyPI, the modified script is made to install a malicious package from a malicious repository or a local path.
    4. The attacker tricks a user into downloading and executing this compromised `ebcli_installer.py` script. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques, such as distributing the malicious script on unofficial websites, forums, or via phishing emails.
    5. When the user executes the compromised script, it will proceed to create a virtual environment and then use `pip` to install the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended `awsebcli`.
    6. The malicious package can contain arbitrary code that will be executed on the user's system during the installation process, potentially leading to a full system compromise.
- Impact:
    - Installation of malware on the victim's system.
    - Data theft and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - Complete compromise of the user's system, allowing the attacker to perform any action with the user's privileges.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not currently implement any measures to prevent the use of a compromised installer script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check of Installer Script**: Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the `ebcli_installer.py` script before execution. This could involve providing a checksum (like SHA256) of the official script on the project's website or repository, allowing users to manually verify the downloaded script before running it.
    - **Code Signing**: Digitally sign the `ebcli_installer.py` script. This would provide a higher level of assurance to users that the script is indeed from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully compromise the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    - The attacker must trick a user into downloading and executing the compromised script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies within the `_install_ebcli` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
    - ```python
      @Step('Installing EBCLI')
      def _install_ebcli(quiet, version, ebcli_source):
          """
          Function installs the awsebcli presumably within the virtualenv,
          ".ebcli-virtual-env", created and activated by this script apriori.
          ...
          """
          if ebcli_source:
              install_args = ['pip', 'install', '{}'.format(ebcli_source.strip())]
          elif version:
              install_args = ['pip', 'install', 'awsebcli=={}'.format(version.strip())]
          else:
              install_args = [
                  'pip', 'install', 'awsebcli',
                  '--upgrade',
                  '--upgrade-strategy', 'eager',
              ]
          returncode = _exec_cmd(install_args, quiet)

          if returncode != 0:
              exit(returncode)
      ```
    - In this function, the `install_args` list determines what `pip install` will execute. An attacker can modify the script to change the package name in `install_args` from `'awsebcli'` to a malicious package name or a path to a local malicious package.
    - When the script executes `_exec_cmd(install_args, quiet)`, it will unknowingly install the malicious package.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious package**: Create a simple Python package named `evil_package` with a `setup.py` and an `__init__.py` that contains malicious code (e.g., code that creates a file in the user's temporary directory).
    2. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`**: Edit the `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py` file. In the `_install_ebcli` function, change the `else` block to install `evil_package` instead of `awsebcli`:
       ```python
       else:
           install_args = [
               'pip', 'install', 'evil_package', # Changed from 'awsebcli'
               '--upgrade',
               '--upgrade-strategy', 'eager',
           ]
       ```
    3. **Distribute the modified script**: Make the modified `ebcli_installer.py` available to a test user (e.g., host it on a local web server or a file share).
    4. **Victim user execution**: As a test user, download the modified `ebcli_installer.py` and the `evil_package`. Run the modified `ebcli_installer.py`: `python ./ebcli_installer.py`. Ensure `evil_package` is accessible to pip during installation (e.g., place `evil_package` directory in the same directory as `ebcli_installer.py` or host it on a local PyPI server and configure pip to use it).
    5. **Verify malicious activity**: Check if the malicious code from `evil_package` was executed during the installation process (e.g., check for the file created by the malicious package in the temporary directory). If the malicious file is created, it confirms that the vulnerability is valid.

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Installer Script in Wrapper Scripts
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    2. The attacker modifies the `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` function or the `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS` dictionary within the script.
    3. The attacker injects malicious code into the generated wrapper scripts (`eb`, `eb.ps1`, `eb.bat`). This code can be executed before or after the legitimate EB CLI command.
    4. The attacker tricks a user into downloading and executing this compromised `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    5. When the user executes the compromised script, it will generate wrapper scripts that contain the attacker's injected malicious code.
    6. Subsequently, whenever the user uses the `eb` command (through the wrapper script), the malicious code will be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system every time the `eb` command is used.
    - Potential for persistent malware installation, data theft, and system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not currently implement any measures to prevent the generation of compromised wrapper scripts from a malicious installer.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check of Installer Script**: Same as in the "Malicious Package Installation" vulnerability, integrity checks for `ebcli_installer.py` are crucial.
    - **Secure Script Generation**: Implement secure coding practices in the script generation logic to minimize the risk of injection, although the primary risk is the compromised installer itself.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully compromise the `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    - The attacker must trick a user into downloading and executing the compromised script.
    - The user must add the installation directory to their PATH and use the `eb` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is in the `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` function and the `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS` dictionary in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
    - ```python
      EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS = {
          'bat': '\n'.join([...]),
          'ps1': '\n'.join([...]),
          'py': """#!/usr/bin/env python
      import subprocess
      import sys

      ...

      exit(_exec_cmd(['{bin_location}/eb'] + sys.argv[1:]))
      """
      }

      @Step('Creating EB wrappers')
      def _generate_ebcli_wrappers(virtualenv_location):
          ...
          if sys.platform.startswith('win32'):
              with open(ebcli_ps1_script_path, 'w') as script:
                  script.write(_powershell_script_body(virtualenv_location))

              with open(ebcli_bat_script_path, 'w') as script:
                  script.write(_bat_script_body(virtualenv_location))
          else:
              with open(ebcli_script_path, 'w') as script:
                  script.write(_python_script_body(virtualenv_location))
              _exec_cmd(['chmod', '+x', ebcli_script_path], False)
      ```
    - An attacker can modify the `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS` dictionary to inject malicious code into the script templates (e.g., in `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS['py']` before `exit(_exec_cmd(['{bin_location}/eb'] + sys.argv[1:]))`).
    - Alternatively, the attacker could modify the `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` function to directly write malicious code into the generated script files.
    - When the user executes the `eb` command, the wrapper script will first execute the injected malicious code before (or instead of) running the actual EB CLI.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`**: Edit the `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py` file. Modify the `EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS['py']` to include a command that creates a file in the user's home directory before executing the EB CLI:
       ```python
       EXECUTABLE_WRAPPERS = {
           'py': """#!/usr/bin/env python
       import subprocess
       import sys
       import os # Added import os

       # Injected malicious code: create a file in home directory
       with open(os.path.expanduser("~/.malicious_file"), "w") as f:
           f.write("Malicious code executed!")

       def _exec_cmd(args):
           ...
           return p.returncode

       activate_this = "{bin_location}/activate_this.py"

       if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
           execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))
       else:
           exec(open(activate_this).read(), dict(__file__=activate_this))

       exit(_exec_cmd(['{bin_location}/eb'] + sys.argv[1:]))
       """
       }
       ```
    2. **Distribute the modified script**: Make the modified `ebcli_installer.py` available to a test user.
    3. **Victim user execution**: As a test user, download the modified `ebcli_installer.py`. Run the modified `ebcli_installer.py`: `python ./ebcli_installer.py`. Follow the instructions to add the `executables` directory to PATH.
    4. **Execute `eb` command**: Open a new terminal and run `eb --version`.
    5. **Verify malicious activity**: Check if the file `.malicious_file` has been created in the user's home directory. If the file exists and contains "Malicious code executed!", it confirms that the malicious code injected into the wrapper script was executed when the `eb` command was used, validating the vulnerability.
