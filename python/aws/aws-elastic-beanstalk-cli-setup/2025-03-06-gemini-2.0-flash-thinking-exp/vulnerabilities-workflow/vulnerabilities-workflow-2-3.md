### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Malicious Package Installation through Compromised Installer Script
* Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the distribution channel of the `ebcli_installer.py` script or creates a fake distribution channel that appears legitimate.
    2. The attacker modifies the `ebcli_installer.py` script to replace the legitimate `awsebcli` package installation command with a command to install a malicious Python package from a malicious repository or local source. For example, the attacker could modify the `_install_ebcli` function to install a package named `awsebcli-malicious` instead of `awsebcli` from PyPI, or point to a local malicious package using `--ebcli-source`.
    3. The attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick users into downloading and executing this compromised `ebcli_installer.py` script. This could involve creating a fake website, sending phishing emails, or compromising the official distribution channel.
    4. When a user executes the compromised script, it proceeds with the installation process as seemingly normal, but instead of installing the legitimate EB CLI, it installs the attacker's malicious Python package within the virtual environment.
    5. The malicious package can contain arbitrary Python code that executes with the user's privileges when imported or used. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as data theft, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.
* Impact:
    - If a user runs the compromised installer script, a malicious Python package will be installed on their system instead of the legitimate EB CLI.
    - The malicious package can execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges, potentially leading to:
        - Confidentiality breach: Stealing sensitive data, including AWS credentials or personal information.
        - Integrity violation: Modifying system files, configurations, or installed software.
        - Availability disruption: Causing the system to malfunction or become unusable.
        - Full system compromise: Allowing the attacker to gain persistent access and control over the user's system.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no mitigations implemented in the provided project files to prevent the distribution of a compromised installer script. The repository provides the script without any mechanism to verify its integrity or authenticity.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Code Signing:** Digitally signing the `ebcli_installer.py` script would allow users to verify the script's origin and integrity, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with after being signed by the legitimate developers.
    - **Checksum Verification:** Providing checksums (like SHA256 hashes) of the official `ebcli_installer.py` script on a trusted website (e.g., the official AWS documentation page) would allow users to verify the integrity of the downloaded script before execution.
    - **Secure Distribution Channel:**  Ensuring the script is distributed through a secure and trusted channel, such as the official AWS website or documentation, reduces the risk of users downloading compromised versions from unofficial sources.
    - **User Education:**  Educating users about the risks of downloading and running scripts from untrusted sources and advising them to always download the installer from the official AWS website.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the `ebcli_installer.py` script or distribute a modified version through social engineering.
    - A user must be tricked into downloading and executing the compromised `ebcli_installer.py` script on their system.
    - The user must have Python and `virtualenv` installed, as per the prerequisites of the installer script.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`_install_ebcli` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`:**
        ```python
        @Step('Installing EBCLI')
        def _install_ebcli(quiet, version, ebcli_source):
            ...
            if ebcli_source:
                install_args = ['pip', 'install', '{}'.format(ebcli_source.strip())]
            elif version:
                install_args = ['pip', 'install', 'awsebcli=={}'.format(version.strip())]
            else:
                install_args = [
                    'pip', 'install', 'awsebcli',
                    '--upgrade',
                    '--upgrade-strategy', 'eager',
                ]
            returncode = _exec_cmd(install_args, quiet)
            ...
        ```
        - This function is responsible for installing the EB CLI using `pip`.
        - In the default case (`else` block), it installs the `awsebcli` package from PyPI.
        - If the `--version` argument is used, it installs a specific version of `awsebcli` from PyPI.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** If the `ebcli_installer.py` script is compromised, an attacker can modify the `install_args` in the `else` block to install a malicious package instead of `awsebcli`. For example, changing `'awsebcli'` to `'malicious-package-name'`.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** If the `--ebcli-source` argument is used with a compromised script, an attacker can trick a user into installing a malicious EB CLI source from a local path or a remote URL controlled by the attacker. Although the intended use of `--ebcli-source` is for development, in a compromised script, it can be abused.
    2. **Execution Flow:**
        - A user downloads and executes the compromised `ebcli_installer.py` script.
        - The script proceeds through the installation steps, including creating and activating a virtual environment.
        - When it reaches the `_install_ebcli` step, it executes the modified `pip install` command, installing the attacker's malicious package.
        - The installation appears to complete successfully, and the user is unaware that a malicious package has been installed.
        - When the user attempts to use the EB CLI (via the generated wrappers), the malicious code within the installed package can be executed.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious Python package:**
        - Create a directory named `malicious_ebcli`
        - Inside `malicious_ebcli`, create `setup.py` with the following content:
          ```python
          from setuptools import setup, find_packages
          import os

          # Malicious code to be executed during installation
          os.system('echo "Malicious code executed during installation!" > malicious_output.txt')

          setup(
              name='awsebcli-malicious', # Use a name that might be confused with the real package
              version='3.14.15',
              packages=find_packages(),
              install_requires=['awsebcli'], # Optionally depend on the real package to maintain some functionality
              entry_points={
                  'console_scripts': [
                      'eb=malicious_ebcli.cli:main', # Create a fake 'eb' entry point
                  ],
              },
          )
          ```
        - Inside `malicious_ebcli`, create a subdirectory `malicious_ebcli` and within it create `__init__.py` and `cli.py`.
        - In `cli.py` add:
          ```python
          import os

          def main():
              # Malicious code to be executed when 'eb' command is run
              os.system('echo "Malicious code executed when eb command is run!" > malicious_command_output.txt')
              print("This is a malicious EB CLI.")
          ```
        - Create a source distribution of this package: `python setup.py sdist` in the `malicious_ebcli` directory. This will create a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file in the `dist` subdirectory.
    2. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py`:**
        - Open `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py` in a text editor.
        - Comment out or remove the original `install_args` assignment in the `_install_ebcli` function's `else` block.
        - Add the following line to install the malicious package from the local file system (adjust the path to your malicious package):
          ```python
          install_args = ['pip', 'install', '/path/to/malicious_ebcli/dist/awsebcli-malicious-3.14.15.tar.gz'] # Replace with the actual path
          ```
          Alternatively, to simulate downloading from a malicious PyPI mirror, you could modify the index URL used by pip, though local installation is simpler for a test case.
    3. **Distribute the modified `ebcli_installer.py` (for testing purposes, just use it locally):**
        - Assume an attacker has socially engineered a user into downloading this modified script.
    4. **Execute the modified `ebcli_installer.py`:**
        - Run the modified script as a normal user: `python ./aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`
        - Observe the output, which should appear similar to a normal installation.
    5. **Verify malicious package installation and code execution:**
        - Check for the files `malicious_output.txt` and `malicious_command_output.txt` in your home directory (or wherever the script was run), indicating that the malicious code was executed during installation and when the `eb` command is (supposed to be) run.
        - Try to run the `eb` command from the newly installed virtual environment's executable directory (after adding it to PATH as instructed by the installer). You should see "This is a malicious EB CLI." printed, and `malicious_command_output.txt` should be created.
        - List the installed packages in the virtual environment using `pip list` inside the virtual environment. You should see `awsebcli-malicious` (or whatever you named your malicious package) instead of or alongside the legitimate `awsebcli` package.

This test case demonstrates that by compromising the `ebcli_installer.py` script, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on a user's system during the EB CLI installation process.
