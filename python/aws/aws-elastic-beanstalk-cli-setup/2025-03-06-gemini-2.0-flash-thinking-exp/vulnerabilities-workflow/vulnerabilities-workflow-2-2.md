- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Download of Installer Script (Supply Chain Vulnerability)
- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a modified version of the `ebcli_installer.py` script. This malicious script can contain arbitrary code to be executed on the user's system.
    2. The attacker hosts this malicious script on a website, shares it via email, or uses other social engineering tactics to trick users into downloading it.
    3. A user, intending to install the EB CLI, unknowingly downloads the malicious script instead of the legitimate one from the official AWS repository.
    4. The user executes the downloaded malicious script using `python malicious_ebcli_installer.py`.
    5. The malicious script executes, performing its intended actions (e.g., installing malware, stealing credentials, or compromising the system) in addition to or instead of the intended EB CLI installation.
- Impact:
    - Full system compromise.
    - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors.
    - Data theft and credential compromise.
    - Potential for lateral movement within the user's network if the compromised system is part of a larger network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project provides the installer script via a public GitHub repository, but there are no mechanisms within the script or project to verify the integrity of the downloaded script before execution. The README.md instructs users to clone the repository, but does not explicitly warn against downloading the script from untrusted sources or provide integrity checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the `ebcli_installer.py` script before execution. This could involve:
        - **Checksum Verification:** Provide a checksum (e.g., SHA256) of the official `ebcli_installer.py` script on the project's website or README.md. Users should manually verify the checksum of the downloaded script before execution.
        - **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign the `ebcli_installer.py` script. The script could then verify the signature before proceeding with the installation.
    - **Clear Security Warnings:** Add prominent warnings in the README.md and any download locations, explicitly instructing users to:
        - Only download the `ebcli_installer.py` script from the official AWS GitHub repository.
        - Verify the authenticity of the download source.
        - Be cautious of downloading the script from any other location.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to host or distribute a modified `ebcli_installer.py` script.
    - A user must be tricked into downloading and executing the malicious script.
    - The user must have Python installed on their system to execute the script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `ebcli_installer.py` script is designed to be executed directly by users to set up the EB CLI.
    - The script performs actions with user privileges, including:
        - Creating directories (`.ebcli-virtual-env`, `executables`).
        - Downloading and installing packages using `pip`.
        - Modifying file permissions (`chmod +x`).
        - Potentially modifying user environment variables (PATH).
    - There is no input validation or integrity check within the `ebcli_installer.py` script itself to ensure that it is the legitimate script from AWS and has not been tampered with.
    - An attacker modifying the script can insert malicious code at any point in the script's execution flow. For example, they could:
        - Modify the `_install_ebcli` function to download and install malicious packages instead of or in addition to `awsebcli`.
        - Modify the `_generate_ebcli_wrappers` function to create wrapper scripts (`eb`, `eb.bat`, `eb.ps1`) that execute malicious commands before or after invoking the actual EB CLI.
        - Add code at the beginning or end of the script to perform arbitrary actions like downloading and executing further malware, stealing files, or creating backdoors.
    - The script relies on the user's trust in the source from which they downloaded the `ebcli_installer.py` file. If this source is compromised, the user's system is at risk.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Script:** Create a modified version of `ebcli_installer.py`. For this test case, let's make it create a file named `malicious_file.txt` in the user's temporary directory to demonstrate arbitrary code execution. Insert the following code at the beginning of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in the malicious script:
        ```python
        import tempfile
        malicious_file_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'malicious_file.txt')
        with open(malicious_file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('This file was created by a malicious installer script.')
        print(f"Malicious file created at: {malicious_file_path}")
        ```
    2. **Host the Malicious Script:**  For testing purposes, you can simply save this malicious script locally with a slightly different name, e.g., `malicious_installer.py`. In a real attack scenario, the attacker would host this on a website or distribute it through other means.
    3. **Prepare a Test Environment:** Use a test machine where you intend to install the EB CLI.
    4. **Execute the Malicious Script:** On the test machine, execute the malicious script: `python malicious_installer.py`.
    5. **Verify Malicious Activity:**
        - Check if the `malicious_file.txt` file exists in the temporary directory of the user who executed the script. The temporary directory path will be printed to the console when the malicious script is executed.
        - Observe the output of the script. It should still attempt to install the EB CLI, but the malicious action (file creation) will also have been performed.
    6. **Expected Result:** The `malicious_file.txt` file should be present in the user's temporary directory, demonstrating that arbitrary code within the modified installer script was successfully executed. This confirms the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that a modified `ebcli_installer.py` can indeed execute arbitrary code on the user's system, highlighting the supply chain vulnerability due to the lack of integrity checks on the installer script itself.
