- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Virtual Environment Activation Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker socially engineers a user into downloading and running a modified version of `ebcli_installer.py`.
    2. The modified script is designed to replace the legitimate `activate_this.py` script within the virtual environment with a malicious version.
    3. The `ebcli_installer.py` script proceeds to create a virtual environment as usual, but it places the attacker's malicious `activate_this.py` in the virtual environment's activation scripts directory.
    4. During the installation process, the `_activate_virtualenv` function in `ebcli_installer.py` is called.
    5. This function uses `execfile` (Python 2) or `exec(open(...).read())` (Python 3) to execute the `activate_this.py` script located in the virtual environment.
    6. Because the attacker has replaced the legitimate script with a malicious one, the attacker's code is executed with the privileges of the user running `ebcli_installer.py`.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system. An attacker can gain full control over the user's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The script does not include any mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `activate_this.py` script or protect against its replacement.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Code signing for the `ebcli_installer.py` script to ensure users are running a legitimate and unmodified version from the official source.
    - Integrity checks or verification of the `activate_this.py` script before execution. This could involve comparing a hash of the script against a known good value. However, since the attacker controls the installer script, this might be bypassed. A more robust solution would be to embed the necessary activation logic directly within the installer, avoiding external script execution for activation.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must be successfully socially engineered into downloading and executing a modified `ebcli_installer.py` script from a malicious source.
    - The user must have Python and `virtualenv` installed, as mentioned in the prerequisites.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in the `_activate_virtualenv` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`:
    ```python
    @Step('Activating virtualenv')
    def _activate_virtualenv(virtualenv_location):
        # ...
        activate_this_path = os.path.join(
            virtualenv_location,
            VIRTUALENV_DIR_NAME,
            activate_script_directory,
            'activate_this.py'
        )

        if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
            execfile(activate_this_path, dict(__file__=activate_this_path))
        else:
            exec(open(activate_this_path).read(), dict(__file__=activate_this_path))
    ```
    - This function constructs the path to `activate_this.py` within the created virtual environment.
    - It then uses `execfile` or `exec(open(...).read())` to execute the script.
    - If an attacker replaces this `activate_this.py` file with malicious code before this function is called, the malicious code will be executed.
    - The `ebcli_installer.py` script itself does not validate or verify the content of `activate_this.py`. It blindly executes whatever script is present at the constructed path.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious `activate_this.py` script:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_activate_this.py` with the following content (example: creating a file in the user's temporary directory):
        ```python
        import os

        malicious_file = os.path.join(os.environ.get("TEMP") or "/tmp", "pwned.txt")
        with open(malicious_file, "w") as f:
            f.write("Successfully exploited via malicious activate_this.py!")

        print("Malicious activate_this.py executed!")
        ```
    2. **Modify `ebcli_installer.py` to inject the malicious script:**
        - Locate the `_create_virtualenv` function in `/code/scripts/ebcli_installer.py`.
        - After the virtual environment creation command (`_exec_cmd(virtualenv_args, quiet)`) and before `_add_ebcli_stamp(virtualenv_directory)`, add code to replace the legitimate `activate_this.py` with the malicious one. The modified section should look like this:
        ```python
        if _exec_cmd(virtualenv_args, quiet) != 0:
            exit(1)

        _add_ebcli_stamp(virtualenv_directory)

        # --- INJECTION START ---
        import shutil
        import os

        malicious_activate_this_source = os.path.abspath("malicious_activate_this.py") # Path to malicious script
        activate_this_destination_dir = os.path.join(virtualenv_directory, '.ebcli-virtual-env', 'bin') # or 'Scripts' on Windows, adapt if needed for test env
        if sys.platform.startswith('win32'):
            activate_this_destination_dir = os.path.join(virtualenv_directory, '.ebcli-virtual-env', 'Scripts')
        activate_this_destination = os.path.join(activate_this_destination_dir, 'activate_this.py')

        shutil.copyfile(malicious_activate_this_source, activate_this_destination)
        print(f"Malicious activate_this.py injected to: {activate_this_destination}")
        # --- INJECTION END ---

        return virtualenv_location
        ```
    3. **Place `malicious_activate_this.py` in the same directory as the modified `ebcli_installer.py`.**
    4. **Run the modified `ebcli_installer.py`:**
        ```bash
        python ./ebcli_installer.py
        ```
    5. **Check for successful exploitation:**
        - After the script execution completes, check for the file `pwned.txt` in your temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp` on Linux/macOS or `%TEMP%` on Windows).
        - The presence of this file indicates that the malicious `activate_this.py` script was successfully executed during the virtual environment activation, confirming the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
