- Vulnerability Name: AWS Credentials Misconfiguration leading to Unauthorized Access

- Description:
    1. An application uses the awswrangler library to interact with AWS services.
    2. The application is configured with AWS credentials, either directly or through environment variables or IAM roles.
    3. If these credentials are misconfigured (e.g., overly permissive IAM policies, exposed secrets, insecure storage), an attacker can potentially exploit this misconfiguration.
    4. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's AWS credentials.
    5. Using these compromised credentials, the attacker can then leverage awswrangler's functionalities to access and manipulate AWS resources (S3, Athena, Redshift, etc.) within the AWS account associated with the misconfigured credentials.
    6. For example, using functions like `wr.s3.to_csv`, `wr.s3.to_json`, `wr.s3.download`, `wr.athena.read_sql_query`, `wr.redshift.unload`, the attacker can read, write, or delete data in S3, execute Athena queries, and access Redshift data.

- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS services like S3, Athena, and Redshift.
    - Data breaches and exfiltration of sensitive information.
    - Data manipulation or deletion within AWS services.
    - Resource abuse, potentially leading to financial loss for the AWS account owner.
    - Potential for escalation of privileges within the AWS account if compromised credentials have excessive permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project itself does not implement mitigations for AWS credential misconfiguration, as it relies on the user's application and AWS SDK configuration for credential management.
    - The documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) emphasizes security best practices such as using IAM roles and secure credential management, but this is not a code-level mitigation.
    - ADR-0004 explicitly states that "AWS SDK for pandas does not alter IAM permissions" and "It is users responsibility to ensure IAM entities they are using to execute the calls have the required permissions."
    - The code includes input validation and argument checks (e.g., in `_validate_args` function in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_write.py` and `/code/awswrangler/s3/_list.py`), but these do not directly mitigate credential misconfiguration.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Code-level enforcement of secure credential management practices within the library is missing, as it's outside the scope of a library focused on data manipulation.
    - Automated checks or warnings within the library to detect potentially insecure credential configurations are not implemented.
    - No built-in mechanisms to restrict the scope of AWS operations based on the library's usage context.
    - Lack of runtime checks within the library to verify the permissions associated with the provided AWS credentials before performing actions.

- Preconditions:
    1. An application is built using the awswrangler library.
    2. The application is deployed with misconfigured or compromised AWS credentials.
    3. The attacker has identified or gained access to the misconfigured application or its environment.
    4. The attacker is able to execute code within the application's environment or interact with the application in a way that leverages the awswrangler library.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided PROJECT FILES, specifically files like `/code/awswrangler/s3/_write_text.py`, `/code/awswrangler/s3/_download.py`, `/code/awswrangler/s3/_list.py`, and others in `/code/awswrangler/s3/` and `/code/awswrangler/athena/`, demonstrate the library's extensive use of boto3 clients (e.g., `s3_client = _utils.client(service_name="s3", session=boto3_session)`).
    - The `open_s3_object` function in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_fs.py`, used by many write and read functions, takes `boto3_session` and `s3_additional_kwargs` as arguments, highlighting the library's reliance on externally provided AWS credentials and configurations.
    - The `_to_text` function in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_write_text.py` shows direct usage of `s3_client` to perform S3 operations like writing CSV and JSON files (`df.to_csv(f, mode=mode, **pandas_kwargs)`, `df.to_json(f, **pandas_kwargs)`). If `s3_client` is initialized with compromised credentials, these operations become attack vectors.
    - The `download` function in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_download.py` uses `open_s3_object` to download files from S3, again relying on the provided credentials.
    - The `list_objects` and `list_directories` functions in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_list.py` utilize `_list_objects` and `_list_objects_paginate`, which interact with S3 using `s3_client` to list buckets and objects.
    - The `describe_objects` and `size_objects` functions in `/code/awswrangler/s3/_describe.py` use `_describe_object` to retrieve object metadata, which is another operation performed using `s3_client`.
    - The functions in `/code/awswrangler/catalog/` for interacting with the Glue Catalog also depend on boto3 sessions, making them vulnerable if credentials are misconfigured.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create an EC2 instance or use an existing accessible environment.
        - Configure AWS credentials for this instance, granting overly permissive IAM permissions (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AthenaFullAccess`). *Crucially, simulate a *misconfigured* application environment where credentials are overly permissive.*
        - Install `awswrangler` and `pandas` in this environment.
        - Create a Python script (`exploit.py`) within the instance with the following code, replacing placeholders with your AWS setup details:

```python
import awswrangler as wr
import pandas as pd

# No explicit credential configuration in code - relying on environment/IAM role

try:
    # Attempt to list S3 buckets
    buckets = wr.s3.list_buckets()
    print("S3 Buckets:", buckets)

    # Attempt to read data from a potentially sensitive S3 bucket (replace with your bucket name and key)
    sensitive_data_path = 's3://<victim-bucket>/<sensitive-data>.csv'
    try:
        df_s3 = wr.s3.read_csv(path=sensitive_data_path)
        print("S3 Data (First 5 rows):\n", df_s3.head())
    except Exception as e_s3:
        print(f"Error reading S3 data: {e_s3}")

    # Attempt to execute an Athena query (replace with your database and table)
    athena_query = "SELECT * FROM <victim-database>.<victim-table> LIMIT 10"
    try:
        df_athena = wr.athena.read_sql_query(sql=athena_query, database="<victim-database>")
        print("Athena Query Results (First 5 rows):\n", df_athena.head())
    except Exception as e_athena:
        print(f"Error executing Athena query: {e_athena}")

except Exception as e_main:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e_main}")

```
    2. **Exploit:**
        - Assume the role of an external attacker who has gained access to the EC2 instance (e.g., through SSH if it's intentionally exposed, or by simulating command execution within the instance).
        - Execute the `exploit.py` script within the EC2 instance environment: `python exploit.py`

    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the output of the `exploit.py` script.
        - **Successful Exploit:** If the script successfully lists S3 buckets, reads data from the sensitive S3 path (or attempts to and shows an access denied error if the bucket policy prevents access from the role, but the attempt is still made), and executes the Athena query, it demonstrates that an attacker, with access to the misconfigured environment, can leverage `awswrangler` to perform unauthorized actions on AWS services due to the overly permissive credentials.
        - **Expected Output (Successful Exploit):** The script should print a list of S3 buckets, followed by the first few rows of data from the sensitive S3 file, and the first few rows from the Athena query result. Even if access to specific resources is denied due to bucket/table policies, the attempt to access them using `awswrangler` with the instance's credentials still validates the vulnerability related to credential misconfiguration.
