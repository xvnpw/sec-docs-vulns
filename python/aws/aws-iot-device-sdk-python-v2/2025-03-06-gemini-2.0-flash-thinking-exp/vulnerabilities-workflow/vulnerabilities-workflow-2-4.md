Okay, I understand the instructions. I'm ready to receive the list of vulnerabilities. Please provide the list, and I will filter it based on the criteria you've provided and return the result in markdown format.

Looking at the JSON you provided as context:

```json
{
"project_description": "This repository contains AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python, which is a library written in Python that allows developers to connect IoT devices to AWS IoT Core.",
"attack_vector": "Attackers may target applications built using sample code from this repository if developers inadvertently copy insecure credential management practices demonstrated in the samples, leading to potential exposure of AWS IoT credentials."
}
```

The key attack vector is **insecure credential management practices in sample code leading to credential exposure**.  When you provide the list of vulnerabilities, I will prioritize vulnerabilities that align with this attack vector and meet all the other inclusion and exclusion criteria you've defined.

**Please provide the list of vulnerabilities now.** I will process them and give you the filtered output.
