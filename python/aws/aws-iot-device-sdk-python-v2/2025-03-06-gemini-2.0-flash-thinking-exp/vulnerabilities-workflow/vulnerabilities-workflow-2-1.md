- Vulnerability Name: Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability due to Disabled TLS Certificate Verification

- Description:
  1. A developer using the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python creates an application to connect to AWS IoT Core.
  2. In the application's code, the developer intentionally or unintentionally disables TLS certificate verification when establishing a connection using the SDK. This is typically done by setting a flag or option within the TLS configuration of the SDK to bypass or skip certificate verification.
  3. An attacker positions themselves in the network path between the device running the application and AWS IoT Core (Man-in-the-Middle position).
  4. The attacker intercepts network traffic between the device and AWS IoT Core.
  5. Because TLS certificate verification is disabled, the application does not validate the identity of the server (AWS IoT Core).
  6. The attacker can impersonate AWS IoT Core, presenting their own certificate (or no certificate) to the application.
  7. The application, due to disabled verification, accepts the attacker's connection as legitimate and establishes a TLS session with the attacker instead of the real AWS IoT Core.
  8. All subsequent communication, including sensitive IoT data exchanged between the application and what it believes to be AWS IoT Core, is now routed through the attacker.
  9. The attacker can passively intercept and record this data or actively modify and inject messages into the communication stream, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the IoT system.

- Impact:
  - Loss of Confidentiality: Sensitive IoT data transmitted between the device and AWS IoT Core can be intercepted and read by the attacker. This data could include sensor readings, device status, control commands, and other proprietary information.
  - Loss of Integrity: The attacker can modify messages in transit, potentially altering device behavior, injecting false data, or disrupting operations by sending malicious commands.
  - Loss of Authentication: The attacker can impersonate legitimate devices or AWS IoT Core, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the IoT system and its resources.
  - Data Manipulation: Attackers could inject malicious data, leading to incorrect application state or actions based on false information.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The SDK itself, by default, enforces TLS certificate verification. This is a core security feature of TLS and is enabled unless explicitly disabled by the developer.
  - There is no specific code in the provided project files that mitigates *intentional disabling* of TLS certificate verification by the application developer, as this is considered a misuse of the SDK rather than a vulnerability in the SDK itself. The SDK provides the tools for secure connection, but the developer is ultimately responsible for using them correctly.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - The SDK could potentially include warnings or best practice guidelines in the documentation and samples that strongly discourage disabling TLS certificate verification and clearly outline the security risks. However, technically preventing a developer from disabling a security feature they might intentionally want to bypass for specific (though generally discouraged) use cases is not within the SDK's scope.
  - No runtime checks within the SDK to detect and warn or prevent disabling of certificate verification as this would interfere with intended use cases where developers might have specific reasons for such configurations (e.g., testing in isolated environments).

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack, meaning they need to be positioned within the network path between the IoT device and AWS IoT Core.
  - The developer must have explicitly disabled TLS certificate verification in the application code using the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python. This is not the default behavior of the SDK and requires conscious effort from the developer to implement.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not contain specific code that demonstrates or enables disabling TLS certificate verification.
  - Reviewing the documentation and code of the `awscrt` library (which the `awsiotsdk` depends on) reveals that the `TlsContextOptions` class, used for configuring TLS within the SDK, *could* potentially be configured to disable certificate verification. However, this is not a readily exposed or encouraged option within the `awsiotsdk` itself.
  - Example code in `MQTT5_Userguide.md` and sample `*.md` files consistently demonstrates establishing secure TLS connections with certificate verification enabled.
  - There is no source code in the provided files that *introduces* this vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from how a developer might *use* the SDK insecurely, which is outside the SDK's direct control.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup Attacker Environment (MITM):**
     - Set up a network environment where you can intercept traffic between the test application and AWS IoT Core. This could involve using tools like `mitmproxy`, `Wireshark`, or setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point.
     - Configure the attacker machine to intercept traffic destined for the AWS IoT Core endpoint used by the test application.
  2. **Modify Sample Application to Disable Certificate Verification:**
     - Choose a sample application from the `samples/` directory, e.g., `pubsub.py`.
     - Modify the sample code to disable TLS certificate verification. This would typically involve adding code to set `verify_peer = False` (or equivalent) in the TLS context options when creating the MQTT client.
     ```python
     # Example modification (this is conceptual, actual code may vary):
     mqtt_connection_builder.mtls_from_path(
         # ... other parameters ...
         tls_ctx=io.ClientTlsContext(io.TlsContextOptions(verify_peer=False)) # Insecure modification!
     )
     ```
     **Warning:** Modifying code to disable TLS verification introduces a real security risk and should only be done for testing in a controlled, isolated environment.
  3. **Run Modified Sample Application:**
     - Execute the modified sample application in the prepared MITM network environment, targeting your AWS IoT Core endpoint.
  4. **Attacker Interception and Verification:**
     - On the attacker machine, use the MITM tool to intercept the TLS handshake between the application and AWS IoT Core.
     - Observe that the TLS handshake completes *without* proper certificate verification, meaning the application does not validate the server's certificate.
     - Using the MITM tool, observe the unencrypted MQTT traffic flowing between the application and the attacker, demonstrating successful interception of sensitive data due to the disabled certificate verification.
  5. **Expected Result:**
     - The security test case will successfully demonstrate that by disabling TLS certificate verification in an application using the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python, a Man-in-the-Middle attacker can intercept and potentially manipulate IoT traffic. This proves the vulnerability arises from insecure application configuration, not a flaw in the SDK itself.
