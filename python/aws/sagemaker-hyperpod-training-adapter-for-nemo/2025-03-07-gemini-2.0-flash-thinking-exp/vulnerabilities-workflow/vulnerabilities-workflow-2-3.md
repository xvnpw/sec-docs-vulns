- vulnerability name: Unsecured `pip install` leading to potential malicious package substitution
- description: An attacker could create a malicious Python package with a name similar to `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` and upload it to a public package index like PyPI. If a user, intending to install the legitimate `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` package, makes a typo or is tricked into using the malicious package name, `pip` might install the attacker's package instead. If the attacker's package includes malicious code in its `setup.py` or installed scripts, it could be executed during the installation process on the user's SageMaker HyperPod environment. This is especially risky if the user is running `pip install` with elevated privileges or in an environment where code execution can lead to significant impact.
- impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's training environment. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification of training jobs, denial of service, or complete compromise of the training environment.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided project files to prevent package substitution attacks. The `README.md` only provides the standard `pip install .[all]` command, without any security warnings or alternative secure installation methods.
- missing mitigations:
    - **Package name squatting:** Register the package name `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` on PyPI and other relevant package indices to prevent attackers from using similar names.
    - **Strong documentation with security warnings:** Clearly document the official package name and installation instructions, explicitly warning users about the risks of installing packages from untrusted sources or with similar names. Recommend installing directly from a trusted source (e.g., GitHub repository or AWS Marketplace if applicable) and verifying package integrity.
    - **Secure setup scripts:** Ensure `setup.py` and any other installation scripts are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities and follow secure coding practices to prevent execution of arbitrary code during installation. For example, avoid dynamic code execution or fetching code from external URLs during setup.
    - **Dependency verification:**  Although not directly related to setup scripts, consider using dependency pinning and hash checking in `requirements.txt` to ensure that dependencies are installed from trusted sources and have not been tampered with. However, this will not prevent initial substitution of the main package itself.
    - **Distribution via trusted channels:** Officially distribute the package through trusted channels like AWS Marketplace or a dedicated AWS repository, guiding users to install from these secure sources rather than relying on public package indices alone.
- preconditions:
    - An attacker successfully creates and deploys a malicious package with a similar name to `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` on a public package index.
    - A user attempts to install `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` using `pip install .[all]` or a similar command, and due to typo, misdirection, or supply chain attack, `pip` resolves and installs the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
    - The user executes `pip install` in an environment where arbitrary code execution is possible and has significant security implications (e.g., training environment with access to sensitive data or infrastructure).
- source code analysis:
    - **File: /code/setup.py:** The `setup.py` file is a standard Python setup script used for packaging and installing Python projects. It uses `setuptools.setup()` which is the entry point for installation. The `parse_requirements()` function reads dependencies from `requirements*.txt` files. If a malicious package is installed instead of the legitimate one, the code within `setup.py` (especially if `install_requires`, `extras_require` or `entry_points` are manipulated) or in the dependencies' setup scripts could be executed during `pip install`. The `entry_points` section defines console scripts, which could be a target for malicious modification.
    - **File: /code/README.md:** The README provides installation instructions using `pip install .[all]`. This instruction, while standard, doesn't include any security warnings about potential package substitution attacks. It highlights `pip install` as the primary installation method, making it a prominent attack vector if users are not cautious.
    - **File: /code/requirements.txt and other requirements_*.txt:** These files list dependencies that will be installed by `pip install .[all]`. While dependency pinning is not analyzed in detail in these files, the general practice of `pip install` from package index without integrity checks opens up the possibility of dependency confusion if a malicious package takes over a dependency name. However, the primary vulnerability is related to substitution of the main package, not its direct dependencies.
- security test case:
    1. **Set up attacker environment:** Create a malicious Python package with the same structure as `hyperpod-nemo-adapter` but with a slightly different name (e.g., `hyperpod-nemo-adapter-malicious`) or same name, and include malicious code in `setup.py` (e.g., code that prints a warning and sleeps for 10 seconds, or more harmful code).
    2. **Deploy malicious package:** Upload the malicious package to a public or private PyPI repository (if possible with a slightly different name to avoid direct overwrite, or attempt to perform a dependency confusion attack if same name).
    3. **Victim setup:** On a clean environment mimicking a SageMaker HyperPod setup, prepare to install `hyperpod-nemo-adapter`.
    4. **Attempt malicious install:** Instead of installing the legitimate package, intentionally or unintentionally use `pip install hyperpod-nemo-adapter-malicious .[all]` (or the substituted package name).
    5. **Observe execution:** Monitor the installation process. If the malicious package is installed, observe if the malicious code in `setup.py` is executed during `pip install`.
    6. **Verify vulnerability:** If the malicious code executes successfully during `pip install`, it confirms the vulnerability. For a more concrete test, the malicious code could attempt to write a file to the file system or make a network connection to demonstrate arbitrary code execution.
