### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Report Generation

- Description:
  1. A malicious user provides a crafted source code file to the Porting Advisor tool for analysis.
  2. The Porting Advisor tool scans the malicious source code and identifies potential porting issues.
  3. As part of the analysis, the tool generates a report, including details about the scanned files and identified issues.
  4. If the crafted source code contains filenames or content that are designed to be malicious (e.g., containing JavaScript code), and these are incorporated into the HTML report without proper sanitization during the report generation process.
  5. When a user opens the generated HTML report in a web browser, the malicious JavaScript code embedded from the crafted source code is executed within the user's browser.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's web browser when they view the generated HTML report. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing sensitive information visible in the browser, such as session cookies or local storage.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as making requests to other websites or modifying content on the current page.
    - Defacing the report page or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - In more advanced scenarios, potentially gaining further access to the user's system depending on browser vulnerabilities and system configurations.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Jinja2 templating engine is used for HTML report generation in `src/advisor/reports/html_report.py`.
  - Autoescape is enabled in Jinja2: `Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(templates_folder), autoescape=True)`. This should automatically escape HTML characters to prevent basic XSS attacks.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - While Jinja2 autoescape is enabled, it's crucial to verify its effectiveness against all potential XSS vectors in this context. Deeper analysis is needed to ensure that autoescape is sufficient for all user-controlled data included in the report, especially filenames and issue descriptions.
  - Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the HTML report to further restrict the capabilities of the browser and mitigate the impact of XSS if it were to occur.
  - Implement a dedicated HTML sanitization function to process any user-provided content before embedding it into the HTML report, ensuring removal of any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML tags, instead of solely relying on Jinja2's autoescape.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to provide maliciously crafted source code as input to the Porting Advisor tool.
  - The user must generate an HTML report using the tool and open this report in a web browser.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. `src/advisor/reports/html_report.py`: The `HtmlReport.write_items` function is responsible for generating the HTML report. It initializes a Jinja2 environment with `autoescape=True`:
     ```python
     env = Environment(
         loader=FileSystemLoader(templates_folder),
         autoescape=True
     )
     ```
  2. The template file `src/advisor/templates/template.html` is loaded and rendered.
  3. The context passed to the template includes `items`, which contains the list of issues and remarks. The template likely iterates through these items and displays their properties, including descriptions. Example from `template.html`:
     ```html
     {% for item in items.negative %}
         <tr>
             <td>{{ item.filename }}</td>
             <td>{{ item.lineno }}</td>
             <td>{{ item.function }}</td>
             <td>{{ item }}</td>
         </tr>
     {% endfor %}
     ```
     Here, `{{ item }}` is used to display the item, which implicitly calls `item.__str__()`. It's necessary to check if `item.__str__()` or any other part of the rendering process introduces unsanitized content into the HTML. Also verify if `item.filename`, `item.lineno`, `item.function` or `item.description` can be attacker controlled and lead to XSS even with autoescape enabled.
  4. Filenames are directly derived from the input directory path provided by the user. If a malicious filename is crafted with XSS payload, and if not properly handled, it could be rendered in the HTML report unsafely.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a test directory, for example, named `xss_test`.
  2. Inside the `xss_test` directory, create a file with a malicious name designed to trigger XSS. For example, name the file ``<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO')>.c``. Note that file creation might have limitations on allowed characters depending on the OS. A simpler test filename might be `\"test<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO')>.c\"` or similar valid filename with HTML injection attempt.
  3. Run the Porting Advisor tool against the `xss_test` directory and generate an HTML report. For example:
     ```bash
     ./porting-advisor-linux-x86_64 xss_test --output report_xss.html
     ```
  4. Open the generated `report_xss.html` file in a web browser.
  5. Observe if an alert box with 'XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO' (or similar indicator) is displayed.
  6. If the alert box appears, it confirms the presence of an XSS vulnerability.
  7. If no alert box appears, inspect the HTML source code of `report_xss.html`. Look for the filename (or parts of it) within the HTML structure, especially within table cells or any other rendered output. Check if the malicious HTML tags (`<img src=x onerror=...>`) are escaped (e.g., as `&lt;img src=x onerror=...&gt;`) or if they are rendered as HTML tags. If rendered as HTML tags, even without immediate JavaScript execution due to browser protections, it still indicates a potential XSS vulnerability that might be exploitable under different conditions or browser configurations.

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Source Code Parsing Logic Vulnerability
    - Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious source code file specifically designed to exploit weaknesses in the Porting Advisor's parsing logic.
        2. A user, intending to analyze their code for Graviton compatibility, uses the Porting Advisor tool and includes the attacker's malicious source code file in the analysis.
        3. When the Porting Advisor parses the malicious source code file, it triggers a vulnerability due to insufficient input validation or improper handling of specific code constructs within the malicious file.
        4. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine running the Porting Advisor tool.
    - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the Porting Advisor. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, and other malicious activities, depending on the privileges of the user running the tool.
    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations: Unknown. Based on the provided information, there are no explicitly mentioned mitigations for vulnerabilities in the parsing logic. It's assumed that standard parsing techniques are used, but without specific hardening against malicious inputs.
    - Missing Mitigations:
        * Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parsed source code files. This should include checks for malicious patterns, excessively long inputs, deeply nested structures, and other potentially exploitable code constructs.
        * Secure Parsing Libraries: Utilize well-vetted and security-audited parsing libraries that are known to be resistant to common parsing vulnerabilities.
        * Sandboxing or Isolation: Isolate the parsing process within a sandboxed environment or container with restricted privileges. This would limit the impact of a successful exploit by preventing the attacker from gaining full system access.
        * Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews specifically focused on the parsing logic to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
    - Preconditions:
        * The user must have downloaded and installed the Porting Advisor command-line tool.
        * The user must intend to analyze source code using the tool and include a malicious source code file provided by the attacker in the analysis.
    - Source Code Analysis:
        The vulnerability lies within the Python code responsible for parsing and processing source code files during the compatibility analysis. Specifically, it would be located in modules handling:
        1. File Reading: Code that reads source code files from the file system. Vulnerabilities could arise if file paths are not properly sanitized, although this is less likely in this specific scenario.
        2. Lexing and Tokenization: The part of the code that breaks down the source code into tokens. A vulnerability could occur if the lexer mishandles extremely long tokens, unusual characters, or specific token sequences in a way that leads to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.
        3. Parsing (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST Generation or similar): The core parsing logic that constructs a structured representation of the source code. This is the most likely area for vulnerabilities. If the parser is not robust, it might be susceptible to:
            * Stack Overflow: Processing deeply nested code structures or recursive grammar rules in the malicious file could exhaust the stack.
            * Buffer Overflow: Incorrect memory management when handling large or complex code structures in the malicious file could lead to buffer overflows.
            * Logic Errors: Flaws in the parsing logic when dealing with specific language constructs in the malicious file could lead to unexpected program behavior, potentially exploitable for code execution.
            * Injection Vulnerabilities: Although less typical in parsing itself, if the parsed data is later used in a way that allows command injection or similar attacks, it could be considered related to parsing vulnerabilities in a broader sense.

        To pinpoint the exact location, a detailed code review of the parsing modules is necessary, focusing on how the tool handles various source code constructs and potential edge cases, especially when processing potentially malicious input. Dynamic analysis and fuzzing with crafted malicious source code files would be essential to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

    - Security Test Case:
        1. Environment Setup: Set up a controlled test environment with the Porting Advisor tool installed. Ensure you have monitoring tools to observe system behavior (e.g., process monitor, network monitor, memory usage).
        2. Malicious File Creation: Craft a malicious source code file. The content of this file should be designed to trigger potential parsing vulnerabilities. Examples include:
            * Extremely long lines or strings: To test for buffer overflows in string handling.
            * Deeply nested structures (e.g., nested loops, function calls): To test for stack overflows or excessive resource consumption.
            * Special characters or escape sequences: To test for input sanitization and handling of unexpected characters.
            * Language-specific constructs known to be problematic in parsers: Research common parsing vulnerabilities related to the specific programming languages supported by the Porting Advisor and create test cases targeting these areas.
        3. Execution and Analysis:
            * Run the Porting Advisor tool and provide the malicious source code file as input for analysis.
            * Monitor the tool's execution for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.
            * Observe system resources (CPU, memory) for unusual spikes that might indicate resource exhaustion attacks.
            * Check for any signs of code execution, such as:
                * Creation of new files in unexpected locations.
                * Network connections initiated by the Porting Advisor process to external hosts.
                * Modification of system files.
                * Unexpected system calls or process execution.
        4. Verification: If any signs of exploitation are observed, analyze the logs, error messages, and system state to confirm the vulnerability and its impact. A successful test would demonstrate that a malicious source code file can indeed trigger a parsing vulnerability leading to code execution or other security-relevant consequences.
