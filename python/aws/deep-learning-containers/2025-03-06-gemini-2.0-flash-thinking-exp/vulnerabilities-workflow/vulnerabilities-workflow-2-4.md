- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via buildspec.yml context path
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `buildspec.yml` file.
    2. Within the `buildspec.yml`, under the `context`, `training_context`, `inference_context` or image-specific `context` sections, the attacker injects a malicious payload into the `source` field of a context artifact definition. This could be achieved by manipulating the `!join` tag or other YAML features to include shell commands.
    3. The `src/main.py` script, when processing this `buildspec.yml`, uses the `source` value without sufficient sanitization when creating the build context.
    4. During the Docker build process, when the script attempts to copy the artifact specified by the attacker-controlled `source` path, the injected commands are executed by the underlying shell.
- Impact:
    - **High/Critical**: Arbitrary command execution on the build server. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the build environment, steal credentials, modify built images, or pivot to internal networks.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the values from `buildspec.yml` without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for all paths and parameters read from `buildspec.yml`, especially the `source` paths in context definitions.
    - Principle of least privilege for the build process.
    - Sandboxing or containerization of the build process to limit the impact of command injection.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify or provide a malicious `buildspec.yml` file to the build process. In the described attack vector, this is achieved by crafting a malicious `buildspec.yml` in a forked repository and triggering a build using it.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `src/main.py` script is the entry point for building Docker images.
    2. The script parses the `buildspec.yml` file specified by the `--buildspec` argument.
    3. The `buildspec.yml` file defines the build process, including context definitions.
    4. In `README.md`, the `context` section of `buildspec.yml` is described, showing how `source` and `target` keys are used to copy files into the Docker build context:
        ```markdown
        context:
          training_context: &TRAINING_CONTEXT
            entrypoint:
              source: docker/artifacts/dockerd-entrypoint.py
              target: dockerd-entrypoint.py
            deep_learning_container:
              source: ../../src/deep_learning_container.py
              target: deep_learning_container.py
        ```
    5. The `!join` tag is used to dynamically construct paths in `buildspec.yml`. If not handled carefully, this could be exploited for command injection.
    6. The `COPY` instruction in Dockerfiles, as shown in `README.md`:
        ```dockerfile
        COPY README-context.rst README.rst
        ```
       relies on the build context. If the build context is compromised due to command injection, arbitrary files can be copied.
    7. The `src/main.py` script uses the `buildspec.yml` to determine which Dockerfiles to build and how to build them, making it a central point for potential vulnerabilities.
    8. Further code analysis of `src/main.py` is needed to pinpoint the exact code locations where the `buildspec.yml` context paths are processed and how they are used in Docker build commands. However, based on the project description and file analysis, command injection via `buildspec.yml` context paths is a highly probable vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Create a malicious `buildspec.yml` file in `mxnet/training/` directory in your forked repository, replacing the original one. In this malicious `buildspec.yml`, modify the `source` field under `context` to inject a command. For example, modify `mxnet/training/buildspec.yml` and change line 20 from:
        ```yaml
        source: docker/artifacts/dockerd-entrypoint.py
        ```
        to:
        ```yaml
        source: !join ['', 'docker/artifacts/dockerd-entrypoint.py', ' ; touch /tmp/pwned']
        ```
        This payload attempts to create a file `/tmp/pwned` inside the build container during the `COPY` command execution.
    3. Set environment variables as described in `README.md` to prepare for building MXNet training container.
    4. Run the build command locally, targeting the modified `buildspec.yml`:
        ```shell script
        python src/main.py --buildspec mxnet/training/buildspec.yml --framework mxnet
        ```
    5. After the build process (or if it fails during build), inspect the resulting Docker image or the build logs for evidence of command execution. In this case, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file exists in the built container. You can run the container locally:
        ```shell script
        docker run --rm <your-built-image-name> sh -c "ls -l /tmp/pwned"
        ```
    6. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.
