### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `build_args` in Image Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious image configuration JSON file.
    2. Within this file, the attacker injects arbitrary commands into the `build_args` field. For example, setting a `build_arg` value to `$(touch /tmp/pwned)`.
    3. The `sagemaker-image-builder build` command is executed, using the attacker-controlled image configuration file.
    4. The `sagemaker-image-builder` tool parses the JSON file and extracts the `build_args`.
    5. These `build_args`, without proper sanitization, are directly incorporated into the `docker build` command as `--build-arg` parameters.
    6. The `docker build` command is executed using `subprocess.check_output`. Due to insufficient input sanitization, the injected commands within `build_args` are executed by the shell during the `docker build` process.
    7. This can lead to arbitrary command execution within the Docker build environment, potentially resulting in container escape or a compromised Docker image.

* Impact:
    - **Container Escape:** A successful command injection can allow an attacker to escape the Docker container during the build process, gaining access to the host system.
    - **Compromised Docker Image:** The attacker can modify the Docker image during the build process, injecting malware, backdoors, or altering the intended functionality of the image. This compromised image, if pushed to a repository and deployed, can lead to further compromise of systems using the image.
    - **Confidentiality and Integrity Violation:** Sensitive data on the build host could be accessed or modified. The integrity of the built Docker image is no longer guaranteed.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly passes the `build_args` from the configuration file to the `docker build` command without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The `sagemaker-image-builder` tool should sanitize all inputs from the image configuration file, especially `build_args` and `additional_packages_env_in_file`, to prevent command injection. For `build_args`, consider validating that values do not contain shell- Metacharacters or disallowing shell command execution within these arguments.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of the image configuration file against a defined schema to ensure only expected data is processed.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  While not directly a mitigation for command injection, running the `sagemaker-image-builder` tool and the Docker daemon with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful exploit.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide a malicious image configuration file to the `sagemaker-image-builder build` command. This could be achieved if the tool is used in an environment where users can supply their own configuration files, or if an attacker can modify existing configuration files.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/sagemaker_image_builder/main.py`
    2. **Function:** `build_images(args)`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def build_images(args):
        with open(args.image_config_file) as jsonfile:
            image_config = json.load(jsonfile)
        target_version = get_semver(args.target_patch_version)
        image_ids, image_versions = _build_local_images(target_version, args.target_ecr_repo, image_config, args.force)
        generate_release_notes(target_version, image_config)

        if args.target_ecr_repo is not None:
            _push_images_upstream(image_versions, args.region)
    ```
    4. The `build_images` function loads the image configuration from the file specified by `args.image_config_file`.
    5. **Function:** `_build_local_images(...)`
    6. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def _build_local_images(
        target_version: Version, target_ecr_repo_list: list[str], image_config: list[dict], force: bool
    ) -> (list[str], list[dict[str, str]]):
        # ...
        for image_generator_config in image_config:
            config = _get_config_for_image(target_version_dir, image_generator_config, force)
            os.environ["DOCKER_BUILDKIT"] = "1"
            raw_build_result = ""
            build_arg_options = sum([["--build-arg", f"{k}={v}"] for k, v in config["build_args"].items()], [])
            docker_build_command = ["docker", "build", "--rm", "--pull"] + build_arg_options + [f"./{target_version_dir}"]
            try:
                raw_build_result = subprocess.check_output(
                    docker_build_command, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, universal_newlines=True
                )
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                print(f"Build failed with exit code {e.returncode}. Output:")
                print(e.output)
                raise
        # ...
    ```
    7. In `_build_local_images`, the code iterates through the `image_config`.
    8. `build_arg_options` is constructed by iterating through `config["build_args"].items()` and creating a list of `--build-arg` parameters.
    9. `docker_build_command` is created by directly concatenating `build_arg_options` into the command list.
    10. `subprocess.check_output(docker_build_command, ...)` executes the Docker build command.
    11. **Vulnerability:** The code directly uses the values from `config["build_args"]` to construct the `docker build` command without any sanitization. This allows for command injection if an attacker can control the contents of the `image_config_file`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a malicious image configuration file named `malicious_config.json` with the following content:**
    ```json
    [
        {
            "image_name": "malicious-image",
            "build_args": {
                "MALICIOUS_ARG": "$(touch /tmp/pwned_host)"
            },
            "env_out_filename": "malicious.env.out",
            "image_type": "cpu"
        }
    ]
    ```
    This configuration attempts to execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned_host` on the host system during the Docker build process by injecting it into a `build_arg`.
    2. **Navigate to the `/code` directory of the project in a terminal.**
    3. **Execute the `sagemaker-image-builder build` command, providing the malicious configuration file:**
    ```shell
    VERSION=0.0.1
    IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE=malicious_config.json
    sagemaker-image-builder build --target-patch-version $VERSION --image-config-file $IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE
    ```
    4. **Check for successful command execution:** After the build command completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned_host` exists on the host system.
    5. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned_host` will be created on the host system, indicating successful command injection and potential container escape. If the file is created, the vulnerability is confirmed.

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `additional_packages_env_in_file` in Image Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `additional_packages_env_in_file`.
    2. Within this file, the attacker injects arbitrary commands. For example, adding a line like `$(touch /tmp/pwned_image)` in the file.
    3. The attacker provides an image configuration JSON file that references this malicious `additional_packages_env_in_file`.
    4. The `sagemaker-image-builder build` command is executed with this configuration.
    5. The `sagemaker-image-builder` tool reads the `additional_packages_env_in_file` and processes its contents.
    6. If the tool improperly handles the content of `additional_packages_env_in_file` and executes it as a shell command or passes it unsanitized to a shell-executing process during the Docker image build, the injected commands will be executed.
    7. This can lead to arbitrary command execution within the Docker build environment, potentially resulting in container escape or a compromised Docker image.

* Impact:
    - **Container Escape:** Similar to the `build_args` injection, this can also lead to escaping the Docker container build environment.
    - **Compromised Docker Image:** Malicious modifications can be injected into the Docker image.
    - **Confidentiality and Integrity Violation:** Host system and image integrity can be compromised.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code reads and processes the `additional_packages_env_in_file` but there is no visible sanitization of its contents before using it in the build process. The code uses `get_match_specs` to parse the file, which is designed to parse conda environment files, but if the file is not strictly in that format and contains shell commands, it might still be exploitable if the contents are later used in a shell context.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate the contents of `additional_packages_env_in_file`. Ensure that the file only contains valid package specifications and does not include any executable commands or shell metacharacters. Validate against expected format.
    - **Secure File Handling:** Process the `additional_packages_env_in_file` in a way that avoids shell interpretation of its contents. If the intention is to process package names, ensure that the parsing logic is robust against unexpected or malicious content.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the file specified as `additional_packages_env_in_file` and reference it in the image configuration JSON file.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/sagemaker_image_builder/main.py`
    2. **Function:** `_create_new_version_conda_specs(...)` and `_get_config_for_image(...)` indirectly uses `additional_packages_env_in_file`.
    3. **Code Snippet in `_create_new_version_conda_specs`:**
    ```python
    def _create_new_version_conda_specs(
        base_version_dir, new_version_dir, runtime_version_upgrade_type, image_generator_config
    ):
        # ...
        additional_packages_env_in_filename = image_generator_config["additional_packages_env_in_file"]
        # ...
        additional_packages_match_specs_in = get_match_specs(f"{new_version_dir}/{additional_packages_env_in_filename}")
        # ...
    ```
    4. **Code Snippet in `_get_config_for_image`:**
    ```python
    def _get_config_for_image(target_version_dir: str, image_generator_config, force_rebuild) -> dict:
        # ...
        config_for_image = copy.deepcopy(image_generator_config)
        # ...
        return config_for_image
    ```
    5. The `additional_packages_env_in_file` path is read from the image configuration and passed to `get_match_specs`. While `get_match_specs` is intended to parse conda environment files and might not directly execute shell commands, if the contents of this file are later used in a context where shell commands are executed (though not directly evident in the provided code snippets for `additional_packages_env_in_file`), it could become a vulnerability. Further analysis of how `additional_packages_env_in_file` is used in Dockerfile or other parts of the build process is needed to confirm if the content of this file can lead to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a malicious additional packages environment input file named `malicious_packages.in` with the following content:**
    ```
    conda-forge::package1
    $(touch /tmp/pwned_image)
    conda-forge::package2
    ```
    This file attempts to inject the command `touch /tmp/pwned_image`.
    2. **Create a malicious image configuration file named `malicious_config_packages.json` with the following content, referencing the malicious packages file:**
    ```json
    [
        {
            "image_name": "malicious-image-packages",
            "build_args": {
                "TAG_FOR_BASE_MICROMAMBA_IMAGE": "jammy-cuda-11.8.0",
                "CUDA_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION": "11.8",
                "ENV_IN_FILENAME": "gpu.env.in",
                "ARG_BASED_ENV_IN_FILENAME": "gpu.arg_based_env.in"
            },
            "additional_packages_env_in_file": "malicious_packages.in",
            "image_tag_suffix": "gpu",
            "env_out_filename": "gpu_packages.env.out",
            "image_type": "gpu"
        }
    ]
    ```
    3. **Place `malicious_packages.in` in the same directory as you will run the build command, or adjust the path in `malicious_config_packages.json` accordingly.**
    4. **Navigate to the `/code` directory of the project in a terminal.**
    5. **Execute the `sagemaker-image-builder build` command with the malicious configuration:**
    ```shell
    VERSION=0.0.1
    IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE=malicious_config_packages.json
    sagemaker-image-builder build --target-patch-version $VERSION --image-config-file $IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE
    ```
    6. **Check for successful command execution:** After the build process completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned_image` exists within the Docker image. This might require running the built image and checking inside the container. Alternatively, check if the command execution leads to any observable side effects on the host system, depending on how the `additional_packages_env_in_file` is processed.
    7. **Refined Check:** Since direct host system compromise via `additional_packages_env_in_file` might be less direct, focus on confirming if the command is executed *within the Docker build context*. A way to verify this is to modify the `Dockerfile` to check for the existence of `/tmp/pwned_image` and fail the build if it exists, or to log the attempt to create the file within the Docker build logs if possible.
    8. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, and if `additional_packages_env_in_file` contents are processed in a way that allows command execution, the `touch /tmp/pwned_image` command will be executed during the Docker build. This could manifest as the file being created inside the image or observable errors in build logs if command execution interferes with the build process. If the file is created within the image context or if other signs of command execution are observed, the vulnerability is confirmed.
