- Vulnerability name: Insecure Storage of OTA Configuration
- Description: The `config.json` file, which contains sensitive information such as S3 bucket names, object keys, IAM role ARNs, and signing profile names, is stored locally in plaintext without any encryption or access control. An attacker gaining access to the local machine where the script is run can read the `config.json` file and obtain sensitive information. This information can be used to redirect OTA updates to attacker-controlled resources by modifying the configuration and rerunning `run_ota_update.py`.
- Impact: By gaining access to the `config.json` file, an attacker can compromise the OTA update process. They can modify the configuration to point to a malicious firmware image hosted on an attacker-controlled S3 bucket. When `run_ota_update.py` is executed, it will create an OTA update job using the attacker's configuration. If IoT devices then download and install this malicious firmware, the attacker can gain control over these devices.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations: The `config.json` file should be stored securely. Implement encryption for sensitive data within the `config.json` file. Consider using a more secure storage mechanism like a dedicated secrets management service or OS-level credential storage. Restrict file system permissions on `config.json` to only allow access to the user running the script.
- Preconditions:
    * The script `setup_ota_update.py` must be executed at least once to generate the `config.json` file.
    * An attacker needs to gain local file system access to the machine where the script was run and where the `config.json` file is stored. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system, social engineering, or physical access.
- Source code analysis:
    * The `setup_ota_update.py` script creates and populates the `config.json` file.
    ```python
    with open('config.json', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as config_file:
        json.dump(data, config_file, indent=4)
    ```
    This code snippet shows that the `config.json` file is written to the local file system in plaintext using `json.dump`. There is no encryption or any access control implemented at this stage to protect the content of this file.
    * The `run_ota_update.py` script reads the `config.json` file in plaintext.
    ```python
    with open('config.json', 'r', encoding="utf-8") as config_file:
        data = json.load(config_file)
    ```
    This code snippet shows that the `config.json` file is read from the local file system in plaintext using `json.load`. The script then uses the data directly to create an OTA update job.

        B --> E[Local File System];
        D --> E;
    ```
- Security test case:
    1.  Run `python3 setup_ota_update.py` and complete the setup process, providing necessary inputs. This will create a `config.json` file in the current directory.
    2.  As an attacker, gain access to the file system where `config.json` is stored. This assumes local access to the machine where the script was executed.
    3.  Open the `config.json` file using a text editor.
    4.  Observe that sensitive information, such as `roleArn`, `bucket`, `key`, `signingProfileName`, and `otaUpdateId`, are stored in plaintext within the file.
    5.  Modify the `config.json` file. Specifically, change the `files[0].fileLocation.s3Location.bucket` and `files[0].fileLocation.s3Location.key` to point to an attacker-controlled S3 bucket and a malicious firmware file. For example:
        ```json
        "files": [
            {
                "fileLocation": {
                    "s3Location": {
                        "bucket": "attacker-controlled-bucket",
                        "key": "malicious-firmware.bin",
                        "version": "your-version"
                    }
                },
                "codeSigning": {
                    "startSigningJobParameter": {
                        "destination": {
                            "s3Destination": {
                                "bucket": "attacker-controlled-bucket"
                            }
                        },
                        "signingProfileName": "your-signing-profile"
                    }
                },
                "fileName": "malicious-firmware.bin"
            }
        ]
        ```
    6.  Save the modified `config.json` file.
    7.  Run `python3 run_ota_update.py`.
    8.  Observe the output of the script. It should indicate that an OTA update job has been created successfully, but it will be configured to use the malicious firmware from the attacker-controlled S3 bucket as specified in the modified `config.json` file.
    9.  If you have an AWS IoT device configured to receive OTA updates from this job, and if the device proceeds with the update, it will download and attempt to install the malicious firmware.

- Vulnerability name: Missing Input Validation in Configuration File
- Description: The `run_ota_update.py` script directly reads and uses values from the `config.json` file without proper validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `config.json` file to inject arbitrary values, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could modify the S3 bucket name, object key, IAM role ARN, or even the OTA update ID in the `config.json` file.
- Impact: By manipulating the `config.json` file, an attacker can influence the behavior of the `run_ota_update.py` script. This could lead to:
    * **Redirection to Malicious Resources:** An attacker can change the S3 bucket and key to point to a malicious firmware image, as described in the "Insecure Storage of OTA Configuration" vulnerability.
    * **Privilege Escalation (potentially):** If an attacker can modify the `roleArn` to an IAM role with broader permissions than intended, the OTA update job might be created with those elevated privileges.
    * **Denial of Service (potentially):** By providing invalid or unexpected values in `config.json`, an attacker might be able to cause the `run_ota_update.py` script to fail, disrupting the OTA update process.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations: Implement input validation in `run_ota_update.py` to verify the integrity and validity of the data read from `config.json` before using it to create an OTA update job. This should include:
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that each configuration parameter is of the expected data type (e.g., string, ARN, boolean).
    * **Format Validation:** Validate the format of ARNs, bucket names, keys, and other parameters to ensure they conform to AWS standards and expected patterns.
    * **Range Validation (where applicable):** If certain parameters have expected ranges or allowed values, validate that the input falls within these constraints.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Consider adding integrity checks, such as checksums or digital signatures, to the `config.json` file to detect unauthorized modifications.
- Preconditions:
    * The script `setup_ota_update.py` must be executed to generate the `config.json` file.
    * An attacker needs to gain local file system access to the machine where the `config.json` file is stored to modify its contents.
- Source code analysis:
    * The `run_ota_update.py` script reads the configuration from `config.json` and directly passes these values to the `create_ota_update` function of the AWS IoT client without any validation.
    ```python
    with open('config.json', 'r', encoding="utf-8") as config_file:
        data = json.load(config_file)

    aws_iot_client = boto3.client('iot')

    response = aws_iot_client.create_ota_update(
        otaUpdateId=data['otaUpdateId'],
        targetSelection=data['targetSelection'],
        files=data['files'],
        targets=data['targets'],
        roleArn=data['roleArn'],
    )
    ```
    As shown in the code, the values from the `data` dictionary (loaded from `config.json`) are directly used as parameters for the `create_ota_update` API call. There are no checks or validations performed on these values before they are used. This means if an attacker modifies `config.json` to contain invalid or malicious data, this data will be directly passed to the AWS API.
    * Visualization:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[config.json - attacker modified] --> B[run_ota_update.py];
        B --> C(AWS IoT SDK create_ota_update - no validation);
    ```
- Security test case:
    1.  Run `python3 setup_ota_update.py` to generate a valid `config.json` file.
    2.  As an attacker, gain local access and open the `config.json` file.
    3.  Modify the `config.json` file to include invalid or unexpected values. Here are a few examples of modifications to test different aspects of input validation:
        * **Invalid S3 Bucket Name:** Change `files[0].fileLocation.s3Location.bucket` to a bucket name that violates S3 naming conventions (e.g., contains uppercase letters or special characters).
        * **Invalid Role ARN:** Modify `roleArn` to an ARN that is syntactically incorrect or points to a non-existent role.
        * **Invalid OTA Update ID:** Change `otaUpdateId` to a value that contains special characters or is excessively long, violating expected naming conventions.
        * **Missing Required Field:** Remove a required field from the `config.json`, such as `otaUpdateId` or `files`.
        * **Incorrect Data Type:** Change a value to an incorrect data type, for example, changing `targetSelection` from a string ("CONTINUOUS" or "SNAPSHOT") to an integer.
    4.  Save the modified `config.json` file.
    5.  Run `python3 run_ota_update.py`.
    6.  Observe the behavior of the `run_ota_update.py` script. Due to the missing input validation, the script might:
        * Attempt to call the AWS IoT API with invalid parameters, which could result in API errors (though this might depend on the specific invalid input and the AWS API's error handling).
        * In some cases, if the invalid input is still somewhat acceptable to the API or leads to unexpected default behavior, the OTA update job might be created in an unintended state or with unexpected configurations.
    7.  Ideally, proper input validation should prevent the script from proceeding with the API call if `config.json` contains invalid data, and instead, it should report an error to the user indicating the configuration issue. However, in the absence of validation, the script might exhibit unexpected behavior or pass invalid data to the AWS API.
