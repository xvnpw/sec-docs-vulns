- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Configuration File Handling leading to AWS Account Takeover

- Description:
    - Step 1: The `setup_ota_update.py` script creates a `config.json` file in the current working directory to store configuration parameters for AWS IoT OTA updates.
    - Step 2: This `config.json` file contains sensitive information such as the OTA update ID, IAM role ARN, target device/group ARNs, S3 bucket details, and signing profile names. These parameters are used to interact with AWS services.
    - Step 3: The script does not enforce any specific file permissions on `config.json` after creation. It relies on the default file permissions of the operating system.
    - Step 4: If the user runs the script in an environment where file permissions are not properly configured (e.g., default permissions allow write access to other users or processes), an attacker can gain write access to `config.json`.
    - Step 5: An attacker with write access can modify the `config.json` file to inject malicious configurations. For example, they can:
        - Change the `roleArn` to an IAM role they control, potentially granting them elevated privileges in the victim's AWS account.
        - Modify the `targets` to include devices or groups they want to compromise.
        - Alter the `files` section to point to malicious update files in an S3 bucket they control.
        - Change the `otaUpdateId` to interfere with existing or future OTA updates.
    - Step 6: When the legitimate user executes `run_ota_update.py`, the script reads the configuration from the compromised `config.json` file.
    - Step 7: The `run_ota_update.py` script then uses these attacker-injected configurations to call the `create_ota_update` API in AWS IoT Core, effectively performing actions in the user's AWS account under the attacker's control.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can gain unauthorized control over the victim's AWS account by manipulating OTA updates. This can lead to:
        - **Data Breach:** Stealing sensitive data from IoT devices by deploying malicious firmware updates that exfiltrate data.
        - **Device Compromise:** Deploying malicious firmware to IoT devices, turning them into botnets or rendering them unusable.
        - **Denial of Service:** Disrupting legitimate OTA updates, preventing devices from receiving critical security patches or functionality updates.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher privileges within the AWS account if the injected IAM role grants broader access than intended.
        - **Resource Hijacking:** Using the victim's AWS resources (S3, IoT Core, Signer, etc.) for malicious purposes, incurring costs for the victim.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script does not implement any specific mitigations to protect the `config.json` file or validate its contents.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Restrict File Permissions:**  The script should set restrictive file permissions on `config.json` immediately after creation (e.g., `chmod 600 config.json` on Linux/macOS) to ensure only the owner (user running the script) can read and write to it. This should be done in `setup_ota_update.py` after writing the configuration to the file.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement input validation in `run_ota_update.py` to verify the integrity and expected format of the data read from `config.json`. This could include schema validation and checks for unexpected or malicious values in critical parameters like ARNs and bucket names.
    - **Configuration File Encryption:** For highly sensitive environments, consider encrypting the `config.json` file to protect the confidentiality of stored credentials and configuration data at rest.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Document and emphasize the importance of running the script with the least privileged AWS credentials necessary and granting only the required permissions to the IAM role used for OTA updates. While not a code mitigation, it's a crucial security practice.
    - **Warning Message:** Display a clear warning message to the user during script execution, emphasizing the importance of securing the `config.json` file and protecting it from unauthorized access.

- Preconditions:
    - The user runs `setup_ota_update.py` in an environment where file system permissions for newly created files are not secure by default, allowing write access to other users or processes.
    - An attacker has some level of access to the system where the script is run and can modify files in the directory where `config.json` is created. This could be due to various factors like shared hosting environments, compromised user accounts, or other vulnerabilities in the system.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`setup_ota_update.py`:**
        ```python
        with open('config.json', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as config_file:
            json.dump(data, config_file, indent=4)
        ```
        - This code block in `setup_ota_update()` is responsible for writing the configuration to `config.json`.
        - It opens the file in write mode (`'w'`) and uses `json.dump()` to serialize the `data` dictionary into the file.
        - **Vulnerability:**  No file permission settings are applied after the file is created. The file will inherit the default permissions, which might be insecure.

    - **`run_ota_update.py`:**
        ```python
        with open('config.json', 'r', encoding="utf-8") as config_file:
            data = json.load(config_file)

        aws_iot_client = boto3.client('iot')

        response = aws_iot_client.create_ota_update(
            otaUpdateId=data['otaUpdateId'],
            targetSelection=data['targetSelection'],
            files=data['files'],
            targets=data['targets'],
            roleArn=data['roleArn'],
        )
        ```
        - This code block in `create_ota_update()` reads the configuration from `config.json`.
        - It opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) and uses `json.load()` to parse the JSON data into the `data` dictionary.
        - It then uses values from the `data` dictionary (like `roleArn`, `targets`, `files`) directly in the `create_ota_update` API call.
        - **Vulnerability:** The script blindly trusts the contents of `config.json`. If an attacker modifies this file, the script will use the malicious configurations without any validation.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup the environment:
        - Install the script and dependencies.
        - Run `python3 setup_ota_update.py` to create a `config.json` file. Complete the setup process with legitimate AWS configurations.
        - **Crucially, before proceeding**, change the file permissions of `config.json` to be world-writable: `chmod 777 config.json`. (This simulates misconfigured file permissions).
    - Step 2: Attacker Modifies `config.json`:
        - As an attacker (in the same system or with access to the file system), edit the `config.json` file using a text editor or command-line tool.
        - Modify the `roleArn` value to an ARN of an IAM role controlled by the attacker. (For a real test, you would create a malicious IAM role in your AWS test account). For example:
          ```json
          {
              "otaUpdateId": "...",
              "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::ATTACKER_ACCOUNT_ID:role/MaliciousOTARole",
              "targets": ["..."],
              "targetSelection": "...",
              "files": [...]
          }
          ```
          Replace `arn:aws:iam::ATTACKER_ACCOUNT_ID:role/MaliciousOTARole` with a placeholder or a real ARN for your testing.
    - Step 3: User Runs OTA Update:
        - As the legitimate user, run `python3 run_ota_update.py`.
    - Step 4: Verify Exploitation:
        - Check the AWS CloudTrail logs or the IAM role used by the `create_ota_update` API call.
        - **Expected Result:** The OTA update creation attempt will be made using the attacker-controlled IAM role specified in the modified `config.json`. If the attacker's IAM role has sufficient permissions, the OTA update will be created under the attacker's control. This demonstrates successful injection of malicious configuration via `config.json`.
        - **Further Verification (Optional but Recommended):** If you set up a malicious S3 file and target device in the attacker-modified `config.json`, you can verify if the malicious OTA update is actually deployed to the target device, confirming full control over the OTA process.

This test case demonstrates that by modifying the `config.json` file, an attacker can influence the AWS API calls made by the script, leading to potential AWS account compromise.
