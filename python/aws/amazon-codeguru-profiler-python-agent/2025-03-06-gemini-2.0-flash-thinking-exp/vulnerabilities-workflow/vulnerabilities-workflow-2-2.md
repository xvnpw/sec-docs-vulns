### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Logging of Profiling Data to File

- Description:
    1. The Amazon CodeGuru Profiler Python Agent allows users to save profiling data to a local file by setting the `reporting_mode` to `file`.
    2. When configured in this mode, the agent, using the `FileReporter`, serializes the collected profiling data into a JSON format.
    3. This JSON data, which includes stack traces, agent metadata, and call graphs, is then written to a file on the local file system.
    4. The profiling data inherently reflects the application's runtime state, including function names, file paths, and potentially, data processed by the application that is captured within stack frames or frame locals.
    5. If the profiled application handles sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data), this data might inadvertently be included in the profiling information.
    6. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the file system where these profile files are stored could read the files and extract sensitive information embedded within the profiling data.
    7. This vulnerability arises because the agent does not sanitize or filter sensitive data before writing the profile to the file.

- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker who gains access to the file system can read the profile files and potentially extract sensitive information that was processed by the profiled application. This could lead to the compromise of credentials, personal data, or other confidential information, depending on the nature of the profiled application and the data it handles.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The current implementation saves the complete profiling data to a file without any data sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Data Sanitization: Implement data sanitization techniques to remove or redact sensitive information from the profiling data before it is written to a file. This could involve techniques like:
        - Frame filtering: Excluding frames from specific modules or functions known to handle sensitive data.
        - Data masking: Redacting or replacing sensitive data patterns (e.g., API keys, passwords) within frame names, file paths, and potentially frame locals (though the latter might be complex and impact profiling accuracy).
    - Access Control: Implement or document the need for strict access control to the directory where profile files are stored. Ensure that only authorized users and processes can read these files.
    - Documentation and User Warning: Clearly document the security implications of using `file` reporting mode. Warn users that profile files might contain sensitive information and advise them on securing access to these files and choosing appropriate storage locations.

- Preconditions:
    - The `reporting_mode` of the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler Python Agent is configured to `file`. This mode is intended primarily for testing and debugging but could be inadvertently used in less secure production-like environments.
    - An attacker must achieve unauthorized access to the file system where the agent stores the generated profile files. This could be through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or system, insider threat, or misconfigured access permissions.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **FileReporter Class:** `/code/codeguru_profiler_agent/file_reporter/file_reporter.py` is responsible for writing the profile data to a file.
    ```python
    class FileReporter(Reporter):
        # ...
        def report(self, profile, agent_metadata=None, timestamp=None):
            # ...
            output_filename = self._output_filename_for(timestamp)
            logger.info("Writing profile to '{}'".format(output_filename))
            with open(output_filename, 'wb') as output_file_stream:
                self._profile_encoder.encode(
                    profile=profile, output_stream=output_file_stream)
            return output_filename
    ```
    2. **ProfileEncoder Class:** `/code/codeguru_profiler_agent/sdk_reporter/profile_encoder.py` encodes the profile data into JSON format.
    ```python
    class ProfileEncoder:
        # ...
        class InnerProfileEncoder:
            # ...
            def encode_content(self):
                profile_in_map = {
                    "start": int(self._profile.start),
                    "end": int(self._profile.end),
                    "agentMetadata": self._encode_agent_metadata(),
                    "callgraph": self._encode_call_graph(self._profile.callgraph),
                    "debugInfo": self._encode_debug_info()
                }
                return json.dumps(profile_in_map)
            # ...
    ```
    3. **Data Serialization:** The `InnerProfileEncoder.encode_content()` method converts the entire `profile` object into a dictionary and then serializes it to JSON using `json.dumps()`. There is no code present within `ProfileEncoder` or `FileReporter` to sanitize or filter the data before serialization. The serialized data includes detailed call graph information derived from stack traces, potentially including sensitive application-specific data.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Modify the application configuration to set `reporting_mode` to `file`.
        - Set `file_prefix` to a known location accessible for later inspection (e.g., `/tmp/codeguru_profiler_test_`).
        - Run a simple Python application that is profiled by the agent. This application should be designed to process and, ideally, include some dummy sensitive data (e.g., a placeholder API key or password) within its operations. For example, the application could read a dummy API key from an environment variable and use it in a function call.

    2. **Execution:**
        - Start the Python application with the CodeGuru Profiler agent attached.
        - Exercise the application's functionality that processes the dummy sensitive data to ensure it is likely to be captured in the stack traces during profiling.
        - Allow the profiler to run for a short duration (e.g., 1-2 reporting intervals) so that it generates at least one profile file.
        - Stop the profiled application.

    3. **Verification:**
        - Locate the profile file generated by the agent in the directory specified by `file_prefix` (e.g., `/tmp/`). The file name will start with the prefix and end with `.json`.
        - Open the JSON profile file and examine its contents, particularly the `callgraph` section.
        - Manually inspect the call graph nodes (frame names, file paths) and agent metadata for any traces of the dummy sensitive data that was processed by the profiled application.
        - If the dummy sensitive data (or patterns resembling sensitive data, depending on the sanitization needs) is found within the profile file, the vulnerability is confirmed.

    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The security test case should confirm that sensitive data processed by the profiled application can be found in the generated profile file when using `file` reporting mode, demonstrating the information disclosure vulnerability.
