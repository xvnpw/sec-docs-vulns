### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Profiling Data Exfiltration via Profiling Group Redirection
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains control over the environment where the application using `codeguru-profiler-agent` is running. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or its dependencies, or by compromising the infrastructure.
    2. The attacker modifies the environment variables `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME` or `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_TARGET_REGION` to point to a profiling group under their control.
    3. The `codeguru-profiler-agent`, upon initialization or during configuration refresh, reads these environment variables and starts reporting profiling data to the attacker-controlled profiling group.
    4. The attacker can then access the collected profiling data, which may contain sensitive information about the application's performance, internal logic, and potentially secrets embedded in the code or memory.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Exfiltration of sensitive profiling data. This data could include application source code snippets, executed function names, call stacks, performance bottlenecks, and potentially exposed secrets or business logic. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain deep insights into the application's inner workings, aiding in further attacks or exposing confidential information.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The agent is designed to report to the configured profiling group, and there are no checks to prevent reporting to an arbitrary group if the environment variables are manipulated.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Configuration Validation and Hardening**: Implement mechanisms to validate the profiling group name and region against an expected or pre-approved list. This could involve:
        - Restricting configuration to be set only through a secure configuration file with limited write access, instead of relying solely on environment variables.
        - Digitally signing the agent's configuration or using a secure vault to store and retrieve valid configuration parameters.
        - Implementing checks to ensure the profiling group and region are consistent with the intended operational environment, possibly by verifying against known AWS account or organizational settings.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Recommend and enforce the principle of least privilege for the IAM role or credentials used by the agent. This role should have the minimum necessary permissions to write profiling data to the intended CodeGuru Profiler profiling group and should not have broader access to other resources or services.
    - **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to the agent's configuration or unexpected reporting behavior. This could include logging configuration changes and monitoring network traffic for unusual destinations.
- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker gains control over the application's execution environment, allowing modification of environment variables.
    2. The application is running with `codeguru-profiler-agent` enabled.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `codeguru_profiler_agent/profiler_builder.py`, the functions `_get_profiling_group_name` and `_get_region` directly read the profiling group name and region from environment variables `PG_NAME_ENV` (`AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME`) and `REGION_ENV` (`AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_TARGET_REGION`).

    ```python
    def _get_profiling_group_name(pg_name=None, pg_name_from_arn=None, env=os.environ):
        return pg_name or _get_profiling_group_name_from_env(pg_name_from_arn, env)

    def _get_region(region_name=None, region_from_arn=None, env=os.environ):
        return region_name or _get_region_from_env(region_from_arn, env)
    ```

    - The `build_profiler` function in `codeguru_profiler_agent/profiler_builder.py` uses these functions to determine the profiling group name and region:

    ```python
    def build_profiler(pg_name=None, region_name=None, credential_profile=None,
                       env=os.environ, session_factory=boto3.session.Session, profiler_factory=None, override=None,
                       should_autocreate_profiling_group=False):
        # ...
        profiling_group_name = _get_profiling_group_name(pg_name, name_from_arn, env)
        # ...
        region = _get_region(region_name, region_from_arn, env)
        # ...
        return profiler_factory(profiling_group_name=profiling_group_name, region_name=region, aws_session=session,
                                    environment_override=override_values)
    ```

    -  The `SdkReporter` class, responsible for reporting profiles, uses the `profiling_group_name` directly, which is derived from the environment variables, without further validation:

    ```python
    class SdkReporter(Reporter):
        # ...
        def __init__(self, environment):
            # ...
            self.profiling_group_name = environment["profiling_group_name"]
            # ...

        def report(self, profile):
            # ...
            self.codeguru_client_builder.codeguru_client.post_agent_profile(
                agentProfile=profile_stream,
                contentType='application/json',
                profilingGroupName=self.profiling_group_name
            )
            # ...
    ```
    - This design allows an attacker who can modify environment variables to redirect profiling data to a destination they control.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a sample Python application that uses `codeguru-profiler-agent`. Ensure the agent is correctly configured and reporting to a legitimate profiling group (e.g., "LegitimateProfilingGroup").
    2. As an attacker, gain access to the application's environment (e.g., through a container escape or compromised application vulnerability).
    3. Modify the environment variable `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME` to point to a profiling group you control, for example, "AttackerProfilingGroup", which you have created in your AWS account.
    4. Trigger the application to generate profiling data (e.g., by sending requests to application endpoints).
    5. Check the "AttackerProfilingGroup" in your AWS account. You should observe profiling data from the target application being reported to this attacker-controlled profiling group.
    6. Verify that no profiling data is being sent to the original "LegitimateProfilingGroup" after the environment variable modification.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can successfully redirect profiling data by manipulating environment variables, confirming the vulnerability.
