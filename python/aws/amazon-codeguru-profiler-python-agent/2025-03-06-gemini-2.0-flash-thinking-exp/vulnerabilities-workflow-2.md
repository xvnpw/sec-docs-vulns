### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Profiling Data Redirection via Environment Variable Manipulation

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains control over the environment variables of an application using the `codeguru-profiler-agent`.
    2. The attacker sets the `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME` environment variable to the name of a profiling group they control in their AWS account.
    3. The application starts or restarts, and the `codeguru-profiler-agent` initializes, reading the profiling group name from the manipulated environment variable.
    4. The agent starts collecting profiling data from the application.
    5. The agent reports the collected profiling data to the profiling group specified in the attacker-controlled environment variable, effectively redirecting sensitive profiling data to the attacker's AWS account.

* Impact:
    - **High:** Sensitive application performance data, including stack traces, performance metrics, and potentially secrets or sensitive information exposed within stack frames, is exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled AWS account. This allows the attacker to gain insights into the application's internal workings, potential vulnerabilities, and sensitive data.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The agent currently reads and uses the profiling group name directly from environment variables or constructor parameters without input validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The agent should validate and sanitize the profiling group name, region, and potentially endpoint URL to prevent redirection to attacker-controlled destinations. For example, the agent could:
        - Restrict profiling group names to a predefined list or pattern.
        - Enforce that the profiling group name matches an expected format.
        - Disallow setting the profiling group name via environment variables and only allow it through secure configuration mechanisms.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Applications using the agent should be deployed with the least privileges necessary. Restricting the ability of external entities to modify environment variables can reduce the risk of this vulnerability. However, this is a general security best practice and not a mitigation within the agent itself.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to control the environment variables of the application where the `codeguru-profiler-agent` is running. This precondition depends on the deployment environment and application configuration. For example, in containerized environments, this could be achieved by modifying the container definition or through other configuration injection methods.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`codeguru_profiler_agent/profiler_builder.py`:**
        - The `build_profiler` function reads the profiling group name from environment variables `PG_NAME_ENV` or `PG_ARN_ENV` and from the `pg_name` parameter.
        - The function `_get_profiling_group_name` prioritizes `pg_name` parameter, then `PG_ARN_ENV`, then `PG_NAME_ENV`.
        - The region name is similarly read from `REGION_ENV`, `region_from_arn`, or `region_name` parameter, with parameter priority.
        - There is no input validation or sanitization of the profiling group name or region obtained from environment variables or parameters.
    2. **`codeguru_profiler_agent/Profiler.py`:**
        - The `Profiler` class constructor takes `profiling_group_name`, `region_name`, and `environment_override` as arguments.
        - It passes these configurations to `ProfilerRunner` and `SdkReporter` which ultimately use the `profiling_group_name` to report data to the CodeGuru Profiler service.
    3. **`codeguru_profiler_agent/sdk_reporter/sdk_reporter.py`:**
        - The `SdkReporter` class uses the `profiling_group_name` to make API calls to CodeGuru Profiler service in the `report` and `refresh_configuration` methods.
        - No validation of `profiling_group_name` is performed before making API calls.

    * Security Test Case:

    **Test Setup:**
    1.  **Attacker AWS Account:** Assume an attacker has an AWS account and has created a Profiling Group named `AttackerProfilingGroup`. Note down the name and region of this profiling group.
    2.  **Victim Application:** Deploy a sample Python application that integrates the `codeguru-profiler-agent`. Ensure the application is configured to send profiling data to a legitimate profiling group (e.g., `LegitimateProfilingGroup`) in a separate AWS account (victim's account).

    **Test Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Target Environment:** Determine how to set environment variables for the victim application. This will depend on the deployment environment (e.g., Docker container, EC2 instance, Lambda function). For example, if it's a Docker container, you might use `docker run -e AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME=AttackerProfilingGroup ...`.
    2.  **Set Malicious Environment Variable:** Modify the victim application's environment variables to set `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_GROUP_NAME` to `AttackerProfilingGroup` (the profiling group in the attacker's AWS account). Ensure `AWS_CODEGURU_PROFILER_ENABLED` is set to `true`.
    3.  **Trigger Profiling:** Run the victim application and trigger actions that generate profiling data (e.g., load testing, specific application workflows).
    4.  **Verify Redirection (Attacker Account):** In the attacker's AWS account, check the CodeGuru Profiler service for the `AttackerProfilingGroup`. Verify that profiling data from the victim application is appearing in this profiling group.
    5.  **Verify Data Absence (Victim Account):** In the victim's AWS account, check the CodeGuru Profiler service for the intended `LegitimateProfilingGroup`. Verify that no (or significantly less) profiling data is being reported to the intended profiling group.

    **Expected Result:**
    - Profiling data from the victim application should be successfully redirected to the `AttackerProfilingGroup` in the attacker's AWS account, demonstrating the vulnerability.
    - No or minimal profiling data should be found in the originally intended `LegitimateProfilingGroup` in the victim's AWS account.
