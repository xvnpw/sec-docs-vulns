#### 1. Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in User-Defined Inference Handlers

- Description:
    1. A user deploys a SageMaker endpoint using the SageMaker Inference Toolkit.
    2. The user implements a custom inference handler, specifically the `input_fn`, to preprocess incoming requests.
    3. Within the `input_fn`, the user's code receives input data from the inference request.
    4. This input data is then improperly used to construct file paths, for example, to load model files or data files.
    5. An attacker crafts a malicious inference request, embedding path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, URL encoded sequences, or similar) within the input data.
    6. If the `input_fn` does not properly sanitize or validate the input data before using it to construct file paths, the attacker can manipulate the file path.
    7. This manipulation allows the attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended model directory or data directory, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or system files on the container.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful path traversal can lead to:
        - **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can read sensitive files on the container, such as configuration files, environment variables, or even model weights if they are stored as files and accessible.
        - **Code Execution (in some scenarios)**: In highly specific and less likely scenarios, if the attacker can overwrite executable files or libraries used by the inference service (depending on file permissions and service design), it *might* lead to code execution, but this is less direct and depends heavily on the user's environment and handler implementation. The primary risk is information disclosure.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None in the Toolkit itself**: The SageMaker Inference Toolkit does not enforce any specific sanitization or validation on user-provided input within the `input_fn` or `model_fn`. It provides the framework but relies on the user to implement secure handlers. The provided code examples in the repository also do not include specific path traversal mitigations in user handler examples.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization Guidance**: The documentation could be improved to explicitly warn users about the risks of path traversal vulnerabilities when handling user-provided input in `input_fn` and `model_fn`. It should recommend best practices for sanitizing and validating user inputs before using them to construct file paths.
    - **Path Validation Functions**: The toolkit could potentially provide utility functions to assist users in validating and sanitizing file paths, ensuring they remain within expected directories. However, this might be too restrictive and limit user flexibility. The primary missing mitigation is clear guidance and warnings.

- Preconditions:
    - **Custom Inference Handler with Vulnerable `input_fn`**: The user must implement a custom inference handler where the `input_fn` (or potentially `model_fn`) uses user-provided input to construct file paths.
    - **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The user's implementation of `input_fn` must fail to sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it in file path construction.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`src/sagemaker_inference/transformer.py`**: This file contains the `Transformer` class that calls the user-defined `input_fn`.
        ```python
        class Transformer(object):
            # ...
            def transform(self, data, context):
                # ...
                for i in range(len(data)):
                    input_data = data[i].get("body")
                    # ...
                    result = self._run_handler_function(
                        self._transform_fn, *(self._model, input_data, content_type, accept)
                    )
                # ...

            def _default_transform_fn(self, model, input_data, content_type, accept, context=None):
                # ...
                data = self._run_handler_function(self._input_fn, *(input_data, content_type)) # Calls user's input_fn
                # ...
        ```
    - The `Transformer` class in `transform` method processes the request data and calls `_default_transform_fn` which then calls the user-defined `input_fn` through `_run_handler_function`.
    - **`src/sagemaker_inference/default_inference_handler.py`**: This file provides a `DefaultInferenceHandler` with a `default_input_fn` that simply decodes the input data based on `content_type`. This default implementation is not vulnerable to path traversal itself, as it doesn't handle file paths. However, it highlights that users are expected to potentially override `input_fn` with their own custom logic, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.

    - **Absence of Path Sanitization in Toolkit**:  A review of the codebase confirms that there are no built-in functions or enforced mechanisms within the SageMaker Inference Toolkit to automatically sanitize or validate file paths constructed within user-defined handlers. The toolkit provides the execution framework, but security is the responsibility of the user implementing the handlers.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Deploy a SageMaker endpoint using the SageMaker Inference Toolkit, with a *deliberately vulnerable* custom inference handler. This vulnerable handler's `input_fn` will take input data and use it to construct a file path to read a file. For demonstration, let's assume the `input_fn` is designed to read a file based on a filename provided in the request body.
    2. **Vulnerable `input_fn` Example (Conceptual Python code within user's `inference.py`):**
        ```python
        import os
        from sagemaker_inference import default_inference_handler

        class VulnerableHandler(default_inference_handler.DefaultInferenceHandler):
            def default_input_fn(self, input_data, content_type, context=None):
                filename = input_data.decode('utf-8') # Assume input is filename
                filepath = os.path.join('/opt/ml/model/data/', filename) # Construct filepath without sanitization
                try:
                    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                        file_content = f.read()
                    return file_content
                except Exception as e:
                    return str(e)

            def default_predict_fn(self, data, model, context=None):
                return {"file_content": data}

            def default_output_fn(self, prediction, accept, context=None):
                return prediction, accept

        ```
    3. **Attack Request**: Send an inference request to the deployed endpoint with a malicious payload designed for path traversal. For example, set the request body to: `"../../../etc/passwd"` (or URL encoded version if necessary).
    4. **Expected Outcome**:
        - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the endpoint should return the content of the `/etc/passwd` file (or an error message indicating access to `/etc/passwd` if direct content reading is restricted by permissions, but path traversal is still successful).
        - This confirms that an attacker can use path traversal sequences in the input to access files outside the intended directory, demonstrating the vulnerability in the user's custom handler.
    5. **Remediation**: The user must modify their `input_fn` to properly sanitize the `filename` input. This could involve:
        - **Input Validation**: Checking if the filename contains any path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
        - **Path Normalization**: Using functions like `os.path.basename` to extract only the filename and prevent directory changes.
        - **Allowed Path List**:  If possible, restrict file access to a predefined list of allowed files or directories, and validate the constructed path against this list.
        - **Sandboxing/Isolation**:  Employ more robust container security measures to limit the impact of path traversal, although input sanitization is the primary defense.

This vulnerability highlights a critical security consideration for users of the SageMaker Inference Toolkit: the responsibility for secure coding practices, especially when handling user input to construct file paths within custom inference handlers. The toolkit itself does not introduce the vulnerability, but it provides an environment where user code vulnerabilities can be exploited.
