- vulnerability name: Potential Code Execution via Malicious Lambda Event Payload
  description: |
    An attacker could craft a malicious Lambda event payload designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in how the `awslambdaric` library processes event data.
    This attack vector targets the event handling logic within the custom Lambda runtime, specifically how the `awslambdaric` library parses and processes the incoming Lambda event.

    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload. This payload could contain unexpected data types, very large strings, deeply nested structures, or attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities in JSON parsing or handling.
    2. The attacker invokes the AWS Lambda function, which is configured to use a custom runtime based on the `awslambdaric` library, and sends the crafted malicious JSON payload as the event data.
    3. The `awslambdaric` library, acting as the Runtime Interface Client, receives this event payload from the Lambda service.
    4. Within the `awslambdaric` library, specifically in components responsible for handling incoming events (e.g., `lambda_runtime_client.py`, `bootstrap.py`, `lambda_runtime_marshaller.py`), the malicious payload is processed.
    5. If a vulnerability exists in the event handling logic (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws due to improper input validation, or issues in JSON deserialization), the crafted payload could exploit this vulnerability.
    6. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution within the security context of the Lambda function's runtime environment. This means the attacker could potentially run arbitrary code within the Lambda function.

  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Lambda function's execution environment.
    This is a critical security impact because it allows an attacker to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to resources and data accessible to the Lambda function.
    - Modify the behavior of the Lambda function.
    - Potentially use the Lambda function as a pivot point to attack other AWS services or resources.
    - Cause denial of service or data corruption.
    The severity is critical due to the potential for full compromise of the Lambda function's runtime environment.

  vulnerability rank: critical
  currently implemented mitigations: |
    Based on the provided files, the following mitigations are currently implemented:
    - JSON parsing is handled using the `simplejson` library, which is generally considered robust against common JSON parsing vulnerabilities.
    - Content type is checked to be `application/json` before attempting JSON parsing in `lambda_runtime_marshaller.py`.
    - The code includes error handling for unmarshalling and marshalling operations, which might prevent some types of crashes but not necessarily code execution vulnerabilities.
    - The `_get_handler` function in `bootstrap.py` includes checks to prevent using built-in modules as handler modules, mitigating some basic module injection attempts.

    However, these mitigations may not be sufficient to prevent all types of code execution vulnerabilities arising from processing maliciously crafted event payloads. Deeper input validation and sanitization within the `awslambdaric` library itself, beyond basic JSON parsing, are not evident from the provided files.

  missing mitigations: |
    The following mitigations are missing or could be improved to further reduce the risk of code execution via malicious Lambda event payloads:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the `awslambdaric` library to handle various types of potentially malicious payloads. This should go beyond just checking content type and valid JSON format. It should include checks for:
      - Maximum payload size.
      - Depth and complexity of JSON structures to prevent resource exhaustion or stack overflows during parsing.
      - Whitelisting or blacklisting specific characters or patterns in keys and values to prevent injection attacks.
      - Data type validation to ensure expected data types are received.
    - **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on event payload handling to identify potential vulnerabilities that might have been missed in development.
    - **Fuzzing:** Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide range of malformed and malicious JSON payloads and test the `awslambdaric` library's robustness against them.
    - **Memory Safety Checks:** If the `runtime_client` extension (written in C++) is a critical part of event processing, ensure it is developed with memory safety in mind to prevent buffer overflows or other memory-related vulnerabilities. Code reviews and static analysis tools should be used.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the custom runtime environment and the `awslambdaric` library operate with the principle of least privilege. Limit the permissions and capabilities available to the runtime environment to reduce the potential impact of a successful code execution exploit.

  preconditions: |
    To trigger this vulnerability, the following preconditions must be met:
    - The attacker must be able to invoke the AWS Lambda function. The method of invocation depends on the Lambda function's configuration (e.g., API Gateway endpoint, SQS queue, etc.).
    - The Lambda function must be configured to use a custom runtime that incorporates the vulnerable version of the `awslambdaric` library.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted event payload as part of the Lambda function invocation.

  source code analysis: |
    Based on the provided files, a direct and obvious code injection vulnerability is not immediately apparent. However, the following areas in the code are relevant to consider for deeper analysis:

    - **`awslambdaric/lambda_runtime_marshaller.py` - `LambdaMarshaller.unmarshal_request`:**
      ```python
      def unmarshal_request(self, request, content_type="application/json"):
          if content_type != "application/json":
              return request
          try:
              return json.loads(request) # simplejson.loads
          except Exception as e:
              raise FaultException(...)
      ```
      - This function uses `simplejson.loads` to parse JSON if the `content_type` is "application/json". While `simplejson` is generally safe, vulnerabilities could still arise depending on how the parsed JSON data is subsequently used within the Lambda function's handler and potentially within `awslambdaric` itself.
      - The lack of further input validation *after* JSON parsing within `awslambdaric` is a potential concern. If the handler or `awslambdaric` components make assumptions about the structure or content of the parsed JSON without proper validation, it could lead to vulnerabilities.

    - **`awslambdaric/bootstrap.py` - `handle_event_request`:**
      ```python
      def handle_event_request(..., event_body, content_type, ...):
          ...
          try:
              event = lambda_runtime_client.marshaller.unmarshal_request(
                  event_body, content_type
              )
              response = request_handler(event, lambda_context)
              ...
          except FaultException as e:
              ...
          except Exception:
              ...
      ```
      - This function is the entry point for processing Lambda events. It unmarshals the request and then calls the user-defined `request_handler`.
      - If the `request_handler` or any code within `awslambdaric` that operates on the unmarshalled `event` makes unsafe assumptions about the data, it could be vulnerable.

    - **`awslambdaric/__main__.py`, `awslambdaric/bootstrap.py` - Handler Loading:**
      - The handler loading mechanism, while including some basic security considerations (like preventing built-in module conflicts), needs to be thoroughly reviewed for any potential injection vulnerabilities if the handler string was to be influenced by external input (which is not the case in standard Lambda invocation, but worth considering for completeness).

  security test case: |
    To validate this potential vulnerability, the following security test case can be implemented:

    1. **Setup:**
       - Deploy a sample AWS Lambda function using a Docker image built with `awslambdaric`. Use the example `Dockerfile` and `app.py` from the `README.md` as a starting point.
       - Ensure the Lambda function is publicly invokable (e.g., through an API Gateway endpoint or by configuring an appropriate trigger).
       - Set up logging for the Lambda function to capture any errors or unusual behavior.

    2. **Craft Malicious Payloads:**
       - Create a series of JSON payloads designed to test different aspects of input handling. Examples include:
         - **Large Payloads:** JSON payloads with very large string values or deeply nested structures to test for buffer overflows or resource exhaustion.
         ```json
         { "large_string": "A" * 1000000 }
         ```
         ```json
         { "nested": { "level1": { "level2": { ... } } } } // Many levels deep
         ```
         - **Payloads with Special Characters:** JSON payloads with special characters in keys and values that might be mishandled during processing.
         ```json
         { "key with !@#$": "value with <script>alert('XSS')</script>" }
         ```
         - **Type Confusion Payloads:** Payloads that attempt to cause type confusion by sending data in unexpected formats.
         ```json
         { "number_as_string": "123" }
         ```
         ```json
         { "array_instead_of_object": [ "item1", "item2" ] }
         ```
         - **Exploiting `simplejson` Vulnerabilities (if any known in used version):** Research known vulnerabilities in the specific version of `simplejson` used by `awslambdaric` and craft payloads to trigger them if applicable. (Check `RELEASE.CHANGELOG.md` for `simplejson` version history and consider testing against older versions if downgrading is possible for testing purposes).

    3. **Execute Test Cases:**
       - For each crafted payload:
         - Invoke the Lambda function, sending the payload as the event data.
         - Monitor the Lambda function's execution and logs for any of the following:
           - **Errors or Crashes:** Look for error messages in CloudWatch Logs indicating parsing failures, exceptions, or crashes within the `awslambdaric` library or the Lambda function.
           - **Unexpected Behavior:** Observe if the Lambda function's response or behavior deviates from the expected outcome for a normal invocation.
           - **Code Execution Indicators (Advanced):** In a more advanced setup, attempt to craft payloads that might trigger observable side effects if code execution occurs (e.g., attempting to write to `/tmp` directory, making network requests if the runtime environment allows, or causing a time delay). This might require more in-depth knowledge of the `awslambdaric` internals and runtime environment.

    4. **Analyze Results:**
       - If any of the payloads trigger errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior, analyze the logs and function execution to determine the root cause.
       - If a payload leads to a crash or error that suggests control over program flow or resource exhaustion, investigate further to confirm if a code execution vulnerability exists. This might involve code debugging or deeper static analysis of the `awslambdaric` library.

    5. **Reporting:**
       - Document the findings. If a code execution vulnerability is confirmed, follow the security reporting guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` to report the vulnerability to the AWS security team.

    **Note:** This test case is designed to be a starting point for vulnerability exploration. The specific payloads and analysis techniques might need to be refined based on further code review and understanding of the `awslambdaric` library's internal workings.
