* Vulnerability Name: CSV Injection in Training Data Loading
* Description: The `LazyTextDataset` in `mico/dataloader/query_doc_pair.py` uses `csv.reader` to parse CSV training data with `doublequote=False`. This setting, combined with specific delimiters and escape characters, can lead to CSV injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can craft malicious CSV data where fields containing quotes or escape characters are not parsed correctly. This can result in misinterpretation of the training data, potentially leading to model poisoning. Specifically, by injecting crafted text within a quoted field that contains commas or escape characters, an attacker can manipulate how the CSV parser interprets the data, causing data fields to be split or merged incorrectly.

* Impact: Model Poisoning. Maliciously crafted training data can bias the topic sharding model, causing it to misclassify documents or queries in a deployed system. This can lead to incorrect topic assignments, routing queries to wrong clusters, and ultimately degrading the performance and reliability of the system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code does not implement any input validation or sanitization for the training data.

* Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for CSV data. Specifically, proper handling of quotes and escape characters in CSV parsing.  Setting `doublequote=True` in `csv.reader` can mitigate basic double quote escaping, but robust input validation is still needed to prevent more complex injection attacks. Consider using a CSV parsing library that is more resilient to injection attacks or implementing manual validation/sanitization of the CSV data before training.

* Preconditions: The attacker needs to be able to provide maliciously crafted CSV training data to the system. In a real-world scenario, this could happen if the training data pipeline is not properly secured and an attacker can inject data into the training dataset.

* Source Code Analysis:
    * File: `/code/mico/dataloader/query_doc_pair.py`
    * Class: `LazyTextDataset`
    * Function: `__getitem__`
    * Vulnerable code:
      ```python
      csv_line = csv.reader([line], **self.csv_reader_setting)
      parsed_list = next(csv_line)
      ```
      * `self.csv_reader_setting` is initialized as `{'delimiter':",", 'quotechar':'"', 'doublequote':False, 'escapechar':'\\', 'skipinitialspace':True}` in the `__init__` method of `LazyTextDataset`.
      * `doublequote=False` disables the handling of double quotes within quoted fields.
      * If a line in the CSV file contains a field like `"value with comma, and quote "" inside"`, with `doublequote=False`, the `csv.reader` might not parse this correctly. It could split the field at the comma inside the quotes, or misinterpret the quotes.
      * An attacker can exploit this by crafting CSV lines that, when parsed, alter the intended training data structure. For example, they could inject extra fields, modify existing fields, or inject specific text into the training data that biases the model.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare Malicious CSV Data: Create a malicious CSV file (e.g., `malicious_train.csv`) with a crafted entry designed to exploit the CSV injection vulnerability. For example, include a document field with injected commas and quotes that, due to `doublequote=False`, will be misparsed. Let's say the CSV structure is "query, ID, doc, click, purchase". A malicious doc field could be: `"Malicious doc, injected data", extra_field`.
    2. Modify `run_mico.sh`: Change the `train_folder_path` in `run_mico.sh` to point to a directory containing `malicious_train.csv`. For simplicity, you can replace the example training data with this malicious file.
    3. Run Training: Execute `run_mico.sh`.
    4. Observe Model Behavior: After training with the malicious data, evaluate the trained model using `infer_on_test` or by running the evaluation separately. Check if the model's behavior is biased towards the injected data. For example, if the injected data contains specific keywords or patterns, see if the model becomes more likely to assign documents or queries containing those keywords to specific clusters, even if they don't naturally belong there.
    5. Verification: Compare the model's performance and clustering results with a model trained on clean data. A significant deviation in performance or cluster assignments, especially related to the injected content, would confirm the model poisoning vulnerability due to CSV injection.
