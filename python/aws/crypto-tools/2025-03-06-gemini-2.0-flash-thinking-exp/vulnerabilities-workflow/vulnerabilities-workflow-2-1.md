### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Default Test Cases in Project Templates

- Description:
    The provided Python project templates include placeholder test files (e.g., `test/unit/test_make_tests.py`) with a single, intentionally failing test case marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)`. This `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` decorator causes pytest to report these tests as "xfail" instead of "fail". If developers use these templates to create new cryptographic libraries and fail to replace these placeholder tests with actual, meaningful tests, they might be misled into believing their project is adequately tested. This is because the test suite will execute without reporting any failures, even though the core cryptographic functionalities remain untested. Consequently, critical security vulnerabilities could be overlooked during development and potentially released in the final product due to insufficient testing.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Use one of the Python project templates provided (e.g., `project-templates/python/{{cookiecutter.github_name}}`) to create a new cryptographic library project.
    2. Proceed with development without modifying or removing the default placeholder test files (e.g., `test/unit/test_make_tests.py`, `test/integration/test_make_tests.py`, `test/functional/test_make_tests.py`, `examples/test/test_make_tests.py`).
    3. Run the test suite using `tox` (e.g., `tox -e py38-local`).
    4. Observe that `tox` reports successful test execution with "xfail" results, but no "failures" or "errors", leading to a false sense of security regarding the project's test coverage.

- Impact:
    Developers may release cryptographic libraries with insufficient or ineffective testing. This can lead to undetected security vulnerabilities within the libraries themselves or in applications that integrate these libraries. The consequence of such vulnerabilities could range from data breaches due to improper encryption, exposure of plaintext data, or other security compromises arising from misused or flawed cryptographic implementations. The lack of robust testing increases the risk of shipping vulnerable cryptographic tools.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None directly within the project templates. The templates include:
    - Test directory structure (unit, integration, functional, examples).
    - Test execution framework (`pytest` and `tox`).
    - Suggestion to use security linters like `bandit`.
    However, there are no mechanisms in place to ensure that developers replace the placeholder tests or write adequate tests for cryptographic functionalities.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Clear Warning in Templates:** Include a prominent warning within the placeholder test files themselves (e.g., as a comment at the top of `test_make_tests.py`) and in the template's README, explicitly instructing developers to replace placeholder tests with real tests relevant to their cryptographic library.
    - **Example Test Cases:** Provide basic example test cases within the templates that demonstrate how to test common cryptographic operations. This could serve as a starting point and guide for developers on writing effective tests for crypto libraries.
    - **CI Configuration to Detect Placeholder Tests:** Enhance CI configurations to detect the presence of placeholder test files (e.g., by checking for files named `test_make_tests.py` or by analyzing the content of test files for the placeholder test function). The CI should fail if placeholder tests are still present in the project, forcing developers to address this issue before merging code.
    - **Test Coverage Threshold:** Implement a minimum test coverage threshold in CI pipelines. While not directly related to placeholder tests, enforcing a reasonable coverage threshold can encourage developers to write more tests and reduce the likelihood of releasing untested crypto code.

- Preconditions:
    - A developer uses one of the provided Python project templates to initiate a new cryptographic library project.
    - The developer proceeds with development but overlooks or forgets to replace the placeholder test files in the template with actual tests that verify the cryptographic functionalities of their library.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/project-templates/python/{{cookiecutter.github_name}}/test/unit/test_make_tests.py`
    ```python
    {{cookiecutter.derived.copyright_notice}}
    """Placeholder module to remind you to write tests."""
    import pytest
    import {{cookiecutter.module_name}}

    @pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)
    @pytest.mark.local
    def test_write_tests():
        assert False
    ```
    - The `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` decorator is used. This decorator, when combined with `strict=True`, marks the test as an expected failure. When pytest runs tests marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)`, they will be reported as "xfail" if they fail (as expected) and as "xpass" if they unexpectedly pass. Critically, neither "xfail" nor "xpass" results in a test suite failure in pytest's default behavior.
    - The test function `test_write_tests` always asserts `False`, ensuring it will always fail as intended by the template creator, and thus be marked as "xfail" by pytest.
    - When a developer runs `tox` or `pytest`, these tests will execute. However, because they are marked `xfail`, the test run will be considered successful as long as no tests without the `xfail` marker fail. This can give a false impression that tests are passing, even when critical cryptographic functionality is completely untested.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Project:** Use the Python project template to create a new project. For example, use `cookiecutter` to generate a project from the template located at `/code/project-templates/python/{{cookiecutter.github_name}}`.
    2. **Do Not Modify Tests:** Navigate to the newly created project directory and leave the default placeholder test files in place (e.g., `test/unit/test_make_tests.py`). Do not add any new test files or modify the existing ones.
    3. **Run Test Suite:** Execute the test suite using `tox`. For example, run `tox -e py38-local` from the project's root directory.
    4. **Examine Test Results:** Observe the output from `tox`. It should indicate that the test environment ran successfully without any failures. You will likely see output similar to: `py38-local: commands succeeded`, and a summary indicating the number of tests run, with results like "1 xfailed in ...s".  Crucially, there will be no indication of test failures that would typically halt a CI pipeline or alert a developer to issues.
    5. **Verification:** The successful execution of `tox` without failures, despite the absence of meaningful tests, demonstrates the vulnerability. A developer might mistakenly conclude that their project is tested because the test command completes successfully, while in reality, the cryptographic functionalities are not being tested at all due to reliance on placeholder tests marked as `xfail`. This scenario proves that the default test setup in the templates can mislead developers into releasing untested cryptographic libraries.
