## Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure handling of `netns` mount option leading to privilege escalation
  - **Description:**
    1. The `mount.efs` script allows mounting EFS file systems within a specified network namespace using the `-o netns=<path>` option.
    2. The script uses the `nsenter` command to execute `mount.nfs4` within the provided network namespace.
    3. If an attacker can control the `netns` path, they could potentially provide a path to a network namespace they own or control.
    4. By mounting the EFS filesystem within a manipulated network namespace and potentially using other mount options to influence the mount behaviour, an attacker might bypass security restrictions or gain unexpected access to resources outside of the intended scope.
    5. This could lead to privilege escalation if the attacker can leverage this access to gain further control over the system.
  - **Impact:** Local privilege escalation. An attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges by manipulating the network namespace in which the EFS filesystem is mounted, potentially bypassing security controls and gaining unauthorized access to system resources or sensitive data.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses the user-supplied path for the `netns` mount option without validation beyond checking if the option is present.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Validate that the `netns` path is safe and restricted to authorized namespaces. Ideally, only allow mounting to namespaces owned by the mounting user or managed by the system administrator.
    - Principle of least privilege: While `mount.efs` needs elevated privileges, the part handling `netns` option should be carefully scrutinized and potentially isolated to minimize the risk of privilege escalation.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - Local attacker access to the system.
    - Ability to execute `mount` command with `efs` type and `-o netns` option, which typically requires `sudo` privileges, but the vulnerability lies in abusing these privileges.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/src/mount_efs/__init__.py`, the `parse_arguments` function processes the mount options.
    2. The `netns` option is extracted from the parsed options:
    ```python
    if "netns" in options:
        command = ["nsenter", "--net=" + options["netns"]] + command
    ```
    3. The `options["netns"]` value, directly provided by the user, is used to construct the `nsenter` command.
    4. No validation or sanitization is performed on the `options["netns"]` value before executing the `nsenter` command.
    5. Visualization:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[mount command with -o netns=/malicious/path] --> B(mount.efs script);
        B --> C{parse_arguments()};
        C --> D[Extract netns option value];
        D --> E[Construct nsenter command with user-supplied path];
        E --> F[subprocess.Popen(nsenter command)];
        F --> G[mount.nfs4 executed in user-controlled netns];
        G --> H[Potential Privilege Escalation];
    ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - An Ubuntu instance with `amazon-efs-utils` installed.
        - Create two network namespaces, `ns1` and `ns2`. `ns1` will be the legitimate namespace, and `ns2` will be controlled by the attacker. For simplicity, we will use paths `/proc/self/ns/net` and `/proc/self/ns/net` for testing purposes but in real attack scenario attacker will control different namespace.
        - Create an EFS filesystem and mount target accessible from the instance.
        - Create a mount point directory, e.g., `/mnt/efs-test`.
    2. **Steps:**
        - As a normal user, execute the mount command, attempting to use `/proc/self/ns/net` as `netns` path.
        ```bash
        sudo mount -t efs -o tls,netns=/proc/self/ns/net <efs_id> /mnt/efs-test
        ```
        - Verify that the mount is successful. This step uses the current namespace and acts as a baseline.
        - As a normal user, execute the mount command, attempting to use `/proc/self/ns/net` again as `netns` path.
        ```bash
        sudo mount -t efs -o tls,netns=/proc/self/ns/net <efs_id> /mnt/efs-test
        ```
        - Examine the process list (e.g., using `ps aux | grep mount.nfs4`) to confirm that `mount.nfs4` process is executed within the specified namespace.
        - Attempt to exploit the manipulated network namespace. This step is highly dependent on the attacker's goal and the specific configuration, but could involve attempting to access network resources outside of the intended namespace or influencing network traffic. For example, try to ping a resource that should not be accessible from the original namespace.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The mount should be successful in both cases.
        - The `mount.nfs4` process should be running within the specified network namespace.
        - The attacker may be able to demonstrate some level of control or bypass of network namespace isolation, although full privilege escalation exploit might require further steps depending on the system configuration and attacker goals.
        - The security test case validates the insecure usage of user-controlled `netns` path, proving the vulnerability exists and can be triggered.
