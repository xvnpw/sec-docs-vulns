### Command Injection via `netns` Mount Option

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious mount command using the `mount.efs` utility.
    2. This command includes the `-o netns=<malicious_path>` option, where `<malicious_path>` contains a command injection payload.
    3. When `mount.efs` is executed with this crafted command, it attempts to use the provided `netns` path.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization in the `mount.efs` script, the malicious payload within the `netns` option is executed as part of the `nsenter` command.
    5. This results in arbitrary command execution on the system with the privileges of the `mount.efs` utility, typically root.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges (root) on the system.
    - This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not sanitize or validate the `netns` mount option value before using it in shell commands.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `netns` mount option to prevent command injection.
    - Use safer alternatives to shell commands: Refactor the code to avoid using shell commands for network namespace manipulation, if possible, or use parameterized commands to prevent injection.
    - Principle of least privilege: While `mount.efs` likely needs root privileges for mounting, ensure that any external command execution is performed with the minimal privileges necessary, if refactoring to avoid shell commands is not feasible.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `mount` command, which is typically restricted to users with `sudo` privileges or root.
    - The `efs-utils` package must be installed, making the `mount.efs` utility available.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/mount_efs/__init__.py`, the `mount_nfs` function constructs the mount command.
    - When the `netns` option is provided, the script prepends the `nsenter` command with the user-supplied `netns` path to the mount command:

    ```python
    if "netns" in options:
        command = ["nsenter", "--net=" + options["netns"]] + command
    ```

    - The `options["netns"]` value, which is directly derived from user input via the `-o netns=` mount option, is concatenated into the shell command without any sanitization.
    - This allows for command injection. For example, if an attacker provides `-o netns="/path/to/netns; whoami > /tmp/pwned"`, the resulting command becomes:

    ```bash
    nsenter --net=/path/to/netns; whoami > /tmp/pwned /sbin/mount.nfs4 ...
    ```

    - This will execute `whoami > /tmp/pwned` before the intended `nsenter` and `mount.nfs4` commands, leading to arbitrary command execution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a test environment with `efs-utils` installed and a writable temporary directory (`/tmp/efs_test_mount`).
    2. As a non-root user, execute the following mount command to attempt command injection:
    ```bash
    sudo mount -t efs -o netns='/tmp/pwned; touch /tmp/efs_pwned_file' <file_system_id> /tmp/efs_test_mount
    ```
    Replace `<file_system_id>` with a placeholder EFS file system ID (it does not need to be a valid ID for this test, as the goal is to test command injection before the mount attempt).
    3. Check if the file `/tmp/efs_pwned_file` has been created:
    ```bash
    ls /tmp/efs_pwned_file
    ```
    If the file exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful.
    4. Examine the file permissions of `/tmp/efs_pwned_file`. It should be owned by `root` because `mount.efs` is executed with root privileges via `sudo`.
    5. (Optional) To further verify, modify the injected command to something more impactful, like creating a user or modifying system files, and observe the results.
