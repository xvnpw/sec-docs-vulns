*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure handling of `mounttargetip` option leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  A malicious user can craft a mount command using `mount.efs` and the `-o mounttargetip=<attacker_controlled_ip>` option.
        2.  `mount.efs` script will use the provided IP address directly to establish a connection to the NFS server.
        3.  If the attacker provides an IP address pointing to an internal service or resource (e.g., an internal HTTP service, metadata endpoint, or database), the `efs-proxy` or `stunnel` process, running with elevated privileges when invoked via `sudo mount`, will initiate a connection to this attacker-specified internal IP address.
        4.  This can be exploited to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, potentially leaking sensitive information or triggering unintended actions on internal systems accessible from the machine where `mount.efs` is executed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access internal resources not intended to be exposed publicly, potentially leaking sensitive data by directing the mount helper to interact with internal services and observing the responses.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not direct privilege escalation, SSRF can be a step in a more complex attack chain to gain further access or control within the internal network.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The code directly uses the provided `mounttargetip` without validation beyond basic string handling.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation for the `mounttargetip` option. Restrict allowed IP addresses to only those expected for EFS mount targets, or preferably resolve the DNS name provided instead of directly accepting an IP.
        *   **Blocklist/Allowlist:**  Maintain a blocklist or allowlist of IP ranges or networks that are considered safe or unsafe for the `mounttargetip` option.
        *   **Warning to User:** If direct IP mounting is necessary, issue a clear warning to the user about the security implications and risks of SSRF.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   User must have `sudo` privileges to execute `mount.efs`.
        *   The attacker must be able to craft a mount command and specify the `mounttargetip` option.
        *   The system where `mount.efs` is executed must have network connectivity to the internal resources the attacker wants to target.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  In `/code/src/mount_efs/__init__.py`, the `parse_arguments` function processes command-line arguments, including options passed with `-o`.
        2.  The `mounttargetip` value from options is directly passed to `get_dns_name_and_fallback_mount_target_ip_address` function.
        3.  In `get_dns_name_and_fallback_mount_target_ip_address` function, if `mounttargetip` option is present, the script directly uses this IP address without further validation in the `mount_nfs` function to construct the mount command.
        4.  The `mount_nfs` function in `/code/src/mount_efs/__init__.py` then uses this IP address to form the NFS mount path:
        ```python
        if legacy_stunnel_mode_enabled(options, config):
            if "tls" in options:
                mount_path = "127.0.0.1:%s" % path
            elif fallback_ip_address:
                mount_path = "%s:%s" % (fallback_ip_address, path) # fallback_ip_address can be attacker controlled via mounttargetip
            else:
                mount_path = "%s:%s" % (dns_name, path)
        else:
            mount_path = "127.0.0.1:%s" % path
        ```
        5.  If stunnel/efs-proxy is used (for TLS mounts), the `connect` directive in the stunnel/efs-proxy configuration is set to this attacker-controlled IP address. This configuration is then used by the privileged `stunnel`/`efs-proxy` process, leading to the SSRF.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Pre-requisites:**
            *   Set up a test instance with `efs-utils` installed.
            *   Ensure the test instance has `sudo` access.
            *   Identify an internal service or resource accessible from the test instance that an attacker could target (e.g., a mock HTTP server listening on an internal IP). Let's assume the internal service IP is `192.168.1.100` and listens on port `80`.
        2.  **Steps:**
            *   Craft a malicious mount command: `sudo mount -t efs -o mounttargetip=192.168.1.100 fs-xxxxxxxx /mnt/test`. Replace `fs-xxxxxxxx` with a dummy filesystem ID (it doesn't need to be a real EFS filesystem for this test as we are testing SSRF before actual mount).
            *   Execute the malicious mount command on the test instance.
            *   Monitor the network traffic from the test instance or logs of the internal service at `192.168.1.100:80`.
        3.  **Expected Result:**
            *   Observe network connection attempts or requests originating from the test instance (specifically from the `stunnel` or `efs-proxy` process if TLS is enabled) to `192.168.1.100:80`.
            *   If you set up a mock HTTP server, you should see HTTP GET requests in its logs, confirming the SSRF vulnerability.
        4.  **Cleanup:**
            *   Unmount the test mount point: `sudo umount /mnt/test` (if mount succeeded partially).
            *   Remove any artifacts created during the test.
