## Combined Vulnerability List

### Command Injection via Hostname/IP Address in Target Argument

* Description:
    1. The `mssh` and `msftp` scripts take user input for the target hostname or IP address without proper sanitization.
    2. This target argument is passed through the `input_parser.py` and `EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py` to construct the final SSH command.
    3. The `EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py` then executes this command using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`.
    4. By providing a malicious hostname or IP address containing shell metacharacters, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell command.
    5. For example, a user can provide a target like ``; touch /tmp/pwned;`` which will be interpreted by the shell, executing the `touch /tmp/pwned` command in addition to the intended SSH command.

* Impact:
    - High: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the `mssh` script with the privileges of the user running the script. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not implement any input sanitization or validation for the target hostname or IP address to prevent command injection.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization of the target hostname/IP address to remove or escape shell metacharacters before passing it to `subprocess.Popen`. Consider using a safe function for shell command construction, such as `shlex.quote` or avoid `shell=True` and pass commands as list to `subprocess.Popen`.
    - Input Validation: Validate the target hostname/IP address against a strict whitelist or regular expression to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `mssh` script.
    - The attacker must be able to provide arguments to the `mssh` script, specifically the target hostname or IP address.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `bin/mssh`: This script is the entry point. It calls `ec2instanceconnectcli.mops.main('ssh', 'ssh')`.
    2. `ec2instanceconnectcli/mops.py`: The `main` function parses arguments using `argparse` and `input_parser.parseargs(args, mode)`. The target is extracted in `input_parser.py`.
    3. `ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`:
        - `parseargs(args, mode)` function processes command line arguments.
        - `_parse_command_flags(custom_flags, instance_bundles, is_ssh=(mode=='ssh'))` parses flags and target from raw command.
        - `_parse_instance_bundles(instance_bundles)` further processes the target, but does not sanitize it. It only validates format like IP address or DNS name using regex and socket functions, not for shell injection.
    4. `ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`:
        - `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class takes the program, instance bundles, key file, flags, and program command as input.
        - `get_command()` method constructs the final command string using string formatting and includes the target via `_get_target()` which uses unsanitized `instance_bundle['host_info']`.
    5. `ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py`:
        - `EC2InstanceConnectCLI` class takes instance bundles, public key, CLI command, and logger as input.
        - `invoke_command()` calls `self.run_command(self.cli_command.get_command())`.
        - `run_command(self, command=None)` executes the command using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`. **Here, `shell=True` is used, which makes the system vulnerable to command injection.** The `command` variable is constructed from user-controlled `target` argument without sanitization.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `mssh` script.
    2. Execute the following command:
        ```bash
        ./bin/mssh ''; touch /tmp/pwned;'@localhost -u default
        ```
    3. After executing the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on your local system.
    4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present because the `touch /tmp/pwned` command, injected through the hostname, was executed on the local system.

### Command Injection via Username Parameter in `mssh` and `msftp`

* Description:
    1. The username parameter is taken as user input and incorporated into the SSH/SFTP command within the `_get_target` method of `EC2InstanceConnectCommand`.
    2. If a malicious username containing shell metacharacters is provided, and if this input is not properly sanitized, these metacharacters can be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    3. For example, providing a username like ``"``; touch /tmp/pwned``"`` will inject the command `touch /tmp/pwned` into the shell command executed by `subprocess.Popen`.

* Impact:
    - High. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the machine running `mssh` or `msftp` with the privileges of the user running the tool. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any sanitization or input validation to prevent command injection in the username parameter. Input validation in `input_parser.py` checks for valid username format but not on preventing shell injection.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for username parameter to remove or escape shell metacharacters before incorporating them into the command.
    - Use of parameterized commands or the `subprocess` module in a way that avoids shell interpretation.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `mssh` or `msftp` command, specifically the username parameter.
    - The tool must be executed on a system where the attacker wants to execute commands.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`:**
        - The `parseargs` function parses the command line arguments.
        - The `_parse_instance_bundles` function extracts the username from the input and validates it using `_is_valid_username`.
        - `_is_valid_username` validates if the username is a valid UNIX username format, but does not sanitize against shell injection.
    2. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`:**
        - The `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class constructs the command string in `get_command`.
        - The `_get_target` method directly incorporates the username into the command string without sanitization.
    3. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py`:**
        - The `EC2InstanceConnectCLI` class executes the generated command in `run_command`.
        - `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)` is used, which makes the application vulnerable to command injection if the command is not properly sanitized.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `mssh` script.
    2. Execute the following command, replacing `<instance-id>` with a valid EC2 instance ID and `<aws-profile>` with your AWS profile if needed:
        ``./bin/mssh -u <aws-profile> "``; touch /tmp/pwned``"@<instance-id>``
    3. After executing the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on your local system.
    4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present because the `touch /tmp/pwned` command, injected through the username, was executed on the local system.

### Command Injection via Flags Argument

* Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the SSH command by providing maliciously crafted flags through the command line arguments of the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` scripts.
    2. The `input_parser.py` module parses the command line arguments and extracts the flags provided by the user.
    3. The `EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py` module then constructs the final SSH command by directly concatenating these user-provided flags into the command string without proper sanitization.
    4. The `EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py` module executes this constructed command using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`, which allows the injected commands to be executed by the system.
    5. For example, an attacker could use a flag like `-o ProxyCommand=bash -c "malicious_command"` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the `mssh` tool.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine running the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` client with the privileges of the user running the tool. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not implement any input sanitization or validation to prevent command injection in the flags argument.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize the flags argument to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before including them in the command string.
    - Command construction without shell: Construct the SSH command using `subprocess.Popen` with a list of arguments instead of `shell=True` to avoid shell interpretation of injected commands.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` scripts. This is typically the case for a local attacker or if the tool is exposed through a web interface or API that takes user-controlled input.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`**: The `_parse_command_flags` function extracts flags from the command line arguments without sanitization.
    2. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`**: The `get_command` function constructs the command string and directly concatenates the unsanitized `self.flags` into the command string.
    3. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py`**: The `run_command` function executes the command using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`. Using `shell=True` makes the application vulnerable to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Navigate to the `bin` directory of the `ec2instanceconnectcli` project.
    3. Execute the `mssh` script with a malicious flag:
        ```bash
        ./mssh -t <instance-id> -z <availability-zone> -r <region> '-o ProxyCommand=bash -c "touch /tmp/pwned"'
        ```
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the system running the `mssh` command.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability exists.

### Command Injection via Program Command Argument

* Description:
    1. The `mssh` script allows users to specify an arbitrary command to be executed on the remote instance after SSH connection.
    2. This `program_command` argument is passed to `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` and is appended to the SSH command string without sanitization.
    3. If the `program_command` contains shell metacharacters, it can lead to command injection when `subprocess.Popen` executes the command with `shell=True`.
    4. For example, providing a `program_command` like `; touch /tmp/pwned;` can result in local command execution.

* Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: No sanitization or validation for the program command argument.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Sanitize the `program_command` argument to escape or remove shell metacharacters.
    - Input Validation: Validate the `program_command` against a whitelist of allowed commands or characters, although sanitization is more practical for general command arguments.

* Preconditions:
    - Attacker can execute `mssh` and provide a program command argument.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py` - `run_command` function:** Executes command using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`.
    2. **`EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py` - `get_command` function:** Constructs the command string by concatenating `self.program_command` without sanitization.
    3. **`mops.py` - `main` function:** Passes `program_command` from parsed arguments to `EC2InstanceConnectCommand`.
    4. **`input_parser.py` - `parseargs` function:** Extracts `program_command` from command line arguments without sanitization.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Navigate to the `bin` directory of the project.
    3. Execute the `mssh` script with a malicious `program_command` argument:
       ```bash
       ./mssh <instance-id> -- '; touch /tmp/pwned; '
       ```
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the local system where `mssh` was executed. If the file exists, the command injection is successful.
