### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Hostname Parameter in `mssh` and `msftp`

* Description:
    1. The `mssh` and `msftp` scripts take user input, including the hostname, which is processed by `ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py` and `ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`.
    2. The hostname parameter is incorporated into the SSH or SFTP command within the `_get_target` method of `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class.
    3. The generated command is executed using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)` in `EC2InstanceConnectCLI.run_command`.
    4. If a malicious hostname containing shell metacharacters is provided as input, and if this input is not properly sanitized, these metacharacters can be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    5. For example, providing a hostname like ``"``; touch /tmp/pwned``"`` will inject the command `touch /tmp/pwned` into the shell command executed by `subprocess.Popen`.

* Impact:
    - High. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the machine running `mssh` or `msftp` with the privileges of the user running the tool. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any sanitization or input validation to prevent command injection in the hostname parameter. Input validation in `input_parser.py` focuses on format (valid DNS, IP, username) but not on preventing shell injection.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for hostname and username parameters to remove or escape shell metacharacters before incorporating them into the command.
    - Use of parameterized commands or the `subprocess` module in a way that avoids shell interpretation (e.g., by passing command as a list and `shell=False`).

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `mssh` or `msftp` command, specifically the hostname parameter (either directly or indirectly through a configuration file if supported - not evident in provided files).
    - The tool must be executed on a system where the attacker wants to execute commands.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`:**
        - The `parseargs` function parses the command line arguments.
        - The `_parse_instance_bundles` function extracts the target hostname from the input.
        - Input validation in `_is_valid_target` checks for valid DNS or IP format but does not sanitize for shell injection.

    ```python
    # File: /code/ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py
    def _parse_instance_bundles(instance_bundles):
        # ...
        for bundle in instance_bundles:
            # ...
            if bundle.get('target', None):
                if not _is_valid_target(bundle.get('target', '')): # Validates DNS/IP but no sanitization
                    # It might be an IP
                    raise AssertionError('Invalid target')
        # ...
        return instance_bundles
    ```

    2. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`:**
        - The `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class constructs the command string in `get_command`.
        - The `_get_target` method directly incorporates the hostname into the command string without sanitization.

    ```python
    # File: /code/ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py
    class EC2InstanceConnectCommand(object):
        # ...
        def get_command(self):
            # ...
            command = "{0} {1}".format(command, self._get_target(self.instance_bundles[0])) # Hostname is directly inserted
            # ...
            return command

        @staticmethod
        def _get_target(instance_bundle):
            # ...
            if instance_bundle.get('host_info', None):
                target = "{0}@{1}".format(instance_bundle['username'], instance_bundle['host_info']) # Hostname is directly used
            # ...
            return target
    ```

    3. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py`:**
        - The `EC2InstanceConnectCLI` class executes the generated command in `run_command`.
        - `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)` is used, which makes the application vulnerable to command injection if the command is not properly sanitized.

    ```python
    # File: /code/ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py
    class EC2InstanceConnectCLI(object):
        # ...
        def run_command(self, command=None):
            # ...
            invocation_proc = Popen(command, shell=True) # shell=True is used, enabling command injection
            # ...
            return invocation_proc.returncode
    ```

    * Security Test Case:
        1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `mssh` script.
        2. Execute the following command, replacing `<instance-id>` with a valid EC2 instance ID and `<aws-profile>` with your AWS profile if needed:
        ``./bin/mssh -u <aws-profile> "``; touch /tmp/pwned``"@<instance-id>``
        3. After executing the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on your local system.
        4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present because the `touch /tmp/pwned` command, injected through the hostname, was executed on the local system.

### Vulnerability 2: Command Injection via Username Parameter in `mssh` and `msftp`

* Description:
    1. Similar to hostname, the username parameter is also taken as user input and incorporated into the SSH/SFTP command within the `_get_target` method of `EC2InstanceConnectCommand`.
    2. If a malicious username containing shell metacharacters is provided, and if this input is not properly sanitized, these metacharacters can be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    3. For example, providing a username like ``"``; touch /tmp/pwned``"`` will inject the command `touch /tmp/pwned` into the shell command executed by `subprocess.Popen`.

* Impact:
    - High. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the machine running `mssh` or `msftp` with the privileges of the user running the tool. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any sanitization or input validation to prevent command injection in the username parameter. Input validation in `input_parser.py` checks for valid username format but not on preventing shell injection.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for username parameter to remove or escape shell metacharacters before incorporating them into the command.
    - Use of parameterized commands or the `subprocess` module in a way that avoids shell interpretation.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `mssh` or `msftp` command, specifically the username parameter.
    - The tool must be executed on a system where the attacker wants to execute commands.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`:**
        - The `parseargs` function parses the command line arguments.
        - The `_parse_instance_bundles` function extracts the username from the input and validates it using `_is_valid_username`.
        - `_is_valid_username` validates if the username is a valid UNIX username format, but does not sanitize against shell injection.

    ```python
    # File: /code/ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py
    def _parse_instance_bundles(instance_bundles):
        # ...
        for bundle in instance_bundles:
            # ...
            if '@' in bundle['target']:
                # A user was specified
                bundle['username'], bundle['target'] = bundle['target'].split('@') # username extracted here
            # ...
            if not _is_valid_username(bundle['username']): # Validates username format but no sanitization
                raise AssertionError('{0} is not a valid UNIX username'.format(bundle['username']))
        # ...
        return instance_bundles
    ```

    2. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`:**
        - The `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class constructs the command string in `get_command`.
        - The `_get_target` method directly incorporates the username into the command string without sanitization.

    ```python
    # File: /code/ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py
    class EC2InstanceConnectCommand(object):
        # ...
        def get_command(self):
            # ...
            command = "{0} {1}".format(command, self._get_target(self.instance_bundles[0])) # Target is constructed using _get_target
            # ...
            return command

        @staticmethod
        def _get_target(instance_bundle):
            # ...
            if instance_bundle.get('host_info', None):
                target = "{0}@{1}".format(instance_bundle['username'], instance_bundle['host_info']) # Username is directly used
            # ...
            return target
