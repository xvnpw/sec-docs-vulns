- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via SSH Flags
- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the SSH command by providing maliciously crafted flags through the command line arguments of the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` scripts.
    2. The `input_parser.py` module parses the command line arguments and extracts the flags provided by the user.
    3. The `EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py` module then constructs the final SSH command by directly concatenating these user-provided flags into the command string without proper sanitization.
    4. The `EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py` module executes this constructed command using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`, which allows the injected commands to be executed by the system.
    5. For example, an attacker could use a flag like `-o ProxyCommand=bash -c "malicious_command"` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the `mssh` tool.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine running the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` client with the privileges of the user running the tool. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not implement any input sanitization or validation to prevent command injection in the flags argument.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize the flags argument to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before including them in the command string.
    - Command construction without shell: Construct the SSH command using `subprocess.Popen` with a list of arguments instead of `shell=True` to avoid shell interpretation of injected commands.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the `mssh` or `mssh-putty` scripts. This is typically the case for a local attacker or if the tool is exposed through a web interface or API that takes user-controlled input.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/input_parser.py`**: The `_parse_command_flags` function extracts flags from the command line arguments.
    ```python
    def _parse_command_flags(raw_command, instance_bundles, is_ssh=False):
        ...
        flags = ''
        ...
        while command_index < len(raw_command) - 1:
            if raw_command[command_index][0] != '-' and not is_flagged:
                # We found something that's not a flag or a flag value.  Exit flag loop.
                break
            used += 1
            # This is either a flag or a flag value
            flags = '{0} {1}'.format(flags, raw_command[command_index])
            ...
        flags = flags.strip()
        ...
        return flags, command, instance_bundles
    ```
    This code iterates through the arguments and accumulates anything starting with '-' as a flag, without any sanitization.

    2. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py`**: The `get_command` function in `EC2InstanceConnectCommand` class constructs the command string.
    ```python
    def get_command(self):
        """
        Generates and returns the generated command
        """
        # Start with protocol & identity file
        command = '{0} -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i {1}'.format(self.program, self.key_file)

        # Next add command flags if present
        if len(self.flags) > 0:
            command = "{0} {1}".format(command, self.flags)
        ...
        return command
    ```
    The line `command = "{0} {1}".format(command, self.flags)` directly concatenates the unsanitized `self.flags` into the command string.

    3. **`ec2instanceconnectcli/EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py`**: The `run_command` function executes the command using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`.
    ```python
    def run_command(self, command=None):
        """
        Runs the given command in a sub-shell
        ...
        """
        if not command:
            raise ValueError('Must provide a command')

        invocation_proc = Popen(command, shell=True)
        ...
        return invocation_proc.returncode
    ```
    Using `shell=True` makes the application vulnerable to command injection because the shell interprets the entire command string, including any malicious commands injected within the flags.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (flags) --> input_parser.py --> EC2InstanceConnectCommand.py (command construction - vulnerable concatenation) --> EC2InstanceConnectCLI.py (run_command with shell=True - execution) --> System Command Execution
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Navigate to the `bin` directory of the `ec2instanceconnectcli` project.
    3. Execute the `mssh` script with a malicious flag:
        ```bash
        ./mssh -t <instance-id> -z <availability-zone> -r <region> '-o ProxyCommand=bash -c "touch /tmp/pwned"'
        ```
        Replace `<instance-id>`, `<availability-zone>`, and `<region>` with valid values for your AWS environment, or use dummy values if you only want to test local command injection.
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the system running the `mssh` command.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability exists.
