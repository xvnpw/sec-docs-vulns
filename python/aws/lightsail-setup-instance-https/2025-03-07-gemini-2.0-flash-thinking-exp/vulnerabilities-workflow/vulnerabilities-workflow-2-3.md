### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure File Permissions on SSL Certificate and Private Key Files
- Description:
    - The provided scripts automate the setup of HTTPS for WordPress instances on Amazon Lightsail.
    - These scripts utilize Let's Encrypt and Certbot to generate SSL certificates.
    - However, the scripts do not explicitly enforce secure file permissions on the generated SSL certificate files (`fullchain.pem`) and private key files (`privkey.pem`).
    - By default, the file permissions set by Certbot or the system might be overly permissive in the context of a shared Lightsail instance.
    - A local attacker who gains unauthorized access to the WordPress instance (e.g., by exploiting a vulnerability in WordPress or its plugins) could potentially read these certificate and private key files.
    - Access to the private key would allow the attacker to impersonate the website, conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, and decrypt website traffic, leading to a significant security breach.
- Impact:
    - Website impersonation: An attacker can use the stolen private key to set up a fake website and impersonate the legitimate website, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks: The attacker can intercept and decrypt traffic between users and the website, compromising sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
    - Loss of confidentiality and integrity: Website traffic and user data can be exposed and manipulated by the attacker.
    - Brand reputation damage: A successful impersonation or data breach can severely damage the website's and organization's reputation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided scripts do not include any explicit steps to set secure file permissions on the SSL certificate and private key files. The scripts rely on the default file permission behavior of Certbot and the underlying operating system.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicitly set restrictive file permissions on the SSL certificate and private key files after certificate generation or renewal.
        - Private key files (`privkey.pem`) should have permissions set to `0600` (read and write for owner only, typically root).
        - Certificate files (`fullchain.pem`) can have permissions set to `0644` (read for owner, group, and others) or `0640` (read for owner and group only, if web server user is in a dedicated group). The owner should be `root`, and the group should be `root` or a dedicated SSL certificate group.
    - Implement file permission checks in the scripts to ensure that the permissions are correctly set and alert administrators if they are not secure.
    - Add documentation that explicitly warns users about the importance of secure file permissions for SSL certificates and private keys and provides instructions on how to manually verify and set these permissions if needed.
- Preconditions:
    - A WordPress instance is deployed on Amazon Lightsail using the provided scripts to enable HTTPS.
    - A certificate has been successfully generated and installed using Certbot.
    - A local attacker gains unauthorized access to the WordPress instance, for example, by exploiting a vulnerability in WordPress, plugins, or through compromised credentials.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Review of `/code/https-rewrite.py` and `/code/le-cert-renewal.py` scripts:
        - Neither script contains any commands or logic to explicitly set or modify file permissions for SSL certificate files or private key files.
        - `le-cert-renewal.py` script calls `certbot renew`, which handles certificate renewal, but the script itself does not interact with file permissions.
        - `https-rewrite.py` script primarily focuses on configuring Apache virtual hosts and WordPress settings for HTTPS redirection and does not involve certificate file permission management.
    - The scripts implicitly rely on the default file permission settings applied by Certbot and the operating system during certificate generation and renewal.
    - If the default permissions are not sufficiently restrictive, especially in a shared environment like Lightsail, a local attacker could potentially access sensitive certificate files.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a WordPress instance on Amazon Lightsail.
    2. Use the provided scripts (specifically, by running `sudo python3 /opt/bitnami/lightsail/scripts/https-rewrite.py <your_certificate_name>`) to set up HTTPS for the WordPress instance. Replace `<your_certificate_name>` with the actual certificate name used during setup.
    3. Log in to the Lightsail instance via SSH as the `bitnami` user (or any user with similar privileges to the web server user).
    4. Navigate to the Let's Encrypt live directory where certificates are stored, typically `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your_domain>/`. Replace `<your_domain>` with the domain name for which the certificate was issued.
    5. List the file permissions of `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` using the command `ls -l`. Observe the permissions.
    6. Attempt to read the content of `privkey.pem` using the command `cat privkey.pem`.
    7. If the `bitnami` user (or the user you are logged in as) can successfully read the `privkey.pem` file, it indicates overly permissive file permissions and confirms the vulnerability.
    8. For a secure configuration, `privkey.pem` should NOT be readable by the `bitnami` user or any user other than `root`. Ideally, the permissions should be `0600` and owned by `root:root`. `fullchain.pem` can be readable by the web server user or group if necessary for the web server to access the certificate, but private key must be restricted to root user only.
