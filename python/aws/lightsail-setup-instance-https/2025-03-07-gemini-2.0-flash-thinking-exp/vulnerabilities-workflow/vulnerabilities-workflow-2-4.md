* Vulnerability Name: Insecure ServerAlias Configuration in Apache VirtualHost

* Description:
    1. The `https-rewrite.py` script is designed to configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection for WordPress instances on Amazon Lightsail.
    2. The script parses the domain names from the output of `certbot certificates` command.
    3. In the `modify_vhost_conf` function, if there is only one domain name associated with the certificate (the primary domain), the script removes the primary domain from the domain list.
    4. Then, it checks the length of the remaining domain list. If the list is empty (meaning only the primary domain was present), it sets the `ServerAlias` directive in the Apache VirtualHost configuration file to `"*"`.
    5. Configuring `ServerAlias *` makes the VirtualHost a catch-all, causing it to respond to requests for any domain name that does not have its own explicitly defined VirtualHost in Apache.
    6. This means that if an attacker points their own domain to the IP address of the Lightsail WordPress instance, the instance will serve the WordPress site for the attacker's domain as well, even if it's not intended.

* Impact:
    1. **Subdomain Takeover Risk:** An attacker can point a subdomain they control to the IP address of the Lightsail instance. Because of the wildcard `ServerAlias`, the WordPress instance will respond to requests for this attacker-controlled subdomain.
    2. **Brand Impersonation:** The attacker can host content on their domain using the WordPress instance's resources, potentially impersonating the legitimate website or brand.
    3. **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could use this to host phishing pages that appear to be associated with the legitimate domain, as the content is served from the legitimate server's IP address (though under a different domain name).
    4. **Resource Consumption:** The WordPress instance might consume resources serving requests for unintended domains, potentially impacting performance for legitimate users.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * There are no mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent the wildcard `ServerAlias` configuration. The script directly sets `ServerAlias *` when only one domain is associated with the certificate.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Avoid Wildcard `ServerAlias`:** The script should avoid setting `ServerAlias *`. Instead, it should only include specific domain names listed in the certificate in the `ServerAlias` directive. If there are no additional domains besides the primary domain, the `ServerAlias` line could be omitted entirely or explicitly set to the primary domain if needed for specific Apache configurations, although generally `ServerName` should suffice for the primary domain.
    * **Best Practice for Virtual Hosts:** Follow the principle of least privilege and explicitly define VirtualHosts for each domain the server is intended to serve, instead of relying on wildcard catch-all configurations.

* Preconditions:
    1. A WordPress instance is deployed on Amazon Lightsail using the scripts provided.
    2. The `https-rewrite.py` script has been executed to enable HTTPS redirection.
    3. The certificate associated with the WordPress instance is configured with only one domain name (the primary domain) or the script is executed in a scenario where it incorrectly determines there are no additional domains.
    4. An attacker has the ability to register and control a domain name and point its DNS records to the public IP address of the Lightsail instance.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/https-rewrite.py` and examine the `modify_vhost_conf` function.
    2. Observe the logic for setting `ServerAlias`:
    ```python
    def modify_vhost_conf(file_path, domain_list):
        # ...
        default_domain = domain_list[0]
        domain_list.remove(domain_list[0])
        aliases = "*"
        if len(domain_list) > 0:
            aliases = " ".join(domain_list)
        # ...
        with open(file_path, "w") as fh:
            for line in lines_before_directory_block:
                if line.startswith("ServerName "):
                    log_info(f"Writing ServerName: {default_domain}")
                    line = f"{LEADING_SPACE}ServerName {default_domain}"
                if line.startswith("ServerAlias "):
                    log_info(f"Writing ServerAlias: {aliases}")
                    line = f"{LEADING_SPACE}ServerAlias {aliases}"
                fh.writelines(f"{line}{NEWLINE}")
        # ...
    ```
    3. The code initializes `aliases = "*"`.
    4. It then checks `if len(domain_list) > 0`.  However, `domain_list` at this point *excludes* the first domain (which was assigned to `default_domain` and used for `ServerName`). So `len(domain_list) > 0` is true only if there were *more than one* domain initially reported by `certbot certificates` output *after* removing "Domains:" prefix.
    5. If the initial `certbot certificates` output had only one domain listed (after "Domains:"), then after removing "Domains:" and the first domain, `domain_list` will be empty, and `len(domain_list) > 0` will be false. In this case, `aliases` remains `"*"`.
    6. Consequently, the `ServerAlias` in the Apache configuration will be set to `"*"` when the certificate is for a single domain, leading to the catch-all VirtualHost configuration.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a fresh WordPress instance on Amazon Lightsail.
    2. Set up HTTPS for the WordPress instance using the provided scripts, ensuring that the Let's Encrypt certificate is issued for only one domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).  Follow the instructions to enable HTTPS rewrite using `https-rewrite.py WebsiteSetupLECert`.
    3. Obtain the public IP address of the Lightsail instance.
    4. Register a new, distinct domain name (e.g., `attackerdomain.com`) that is not related to the WordPress instance or the certificate.
    5. Configure the DNS records for `attackerdomain.com` to point the A record to the public IP address of the Lightsail instance. Wait for DNS propagation.
    6. Access `http://attackerdomain.com` in a web browser.
    7. Observe that you are redirected to `https://attackerdomain.com`.
    8. Further observe that the content of the WordPress site (originally intended for `yourdomain.com`) is displayed at `https://attackerdomain.com`.
    9. This confirms that the WordPress instance is incorrectly responding to requests for `attackerdomain.com` due to the wildcard `ServerAlias` configuration.
