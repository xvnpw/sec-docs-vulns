### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Command Injection in `https-rewrite.py` via `cert_name`

- **Description:**
    1. The `https-rewrite.py` script is designed to be executed during the `SetupInstanceHttps` API call in Amazon Lightsail.
    2. The script takes a certificate name as a command-line argument via `argv[1]`, which is assigned to the variable `cert_name`.
    3. This `cert_name` variable is then directly embedded into a shell command string within an f-string: `f'certbot certificates | grep "Certificate Name: {cert_name}" -A{LINES_AFTER} | grep "Domains: "'`.
    4. This command string is executed using `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, which interprets the entire command string as a shell command, including any shell metacharacters present in the `cert_name` variable.
    5. An attacker who can control the `cert_name` argument, likely through the `SetupInstanceHttps` API call parameters, can inject malicious shell commands by crafting a `cert_name` containing shell metacharacters and commands.
    6. For example, by providing a `cert_name` like `"test"; whoami #`, the resulting command executed by the script becomes: `certbot certificates | grep "Certificate Name: test"; whoami # -A5 | grep "Domains: "`.
    7. Due to `shell=True`, the injected command `whoami` is executed on the system.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the underlying Lightsail instance.
    - The commands are executed with the privileges of the user running the `https-rewrite.py` script, which is likely root or a highly privileged user in automated setup scenarios.
    - This can lead to a complete compromise of the Lightsail instance, including:
        - Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Modification or deletion of critical system files.
        - Denial of service.
        - Lateral movement to other systems within the AWS environment if instance roles are misconfigured.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code does not include any input validation, sanitization, or encoding of the `cert_name` argument before using it in the shell command.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The `cert_name` argument received from external sources (like API calls) should be rigorously validated to ensure it conforms to expected patterns (e.g., alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and dots only) and does not contain any shell metacharacters or command separators.
    - **Use `shlex.quote`:** If using `shell=True` is deemed absolutely necessary, the `cert_name` argument should be passed through `shlex.quote` before being incorporated into the command string. This will properly escape shell metacharacters and prevent command injection.
    - **Avoid `shell=True`:** The most secure approach is to avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` altogether. Instead, the command and its arguments should be passed as a list to `subprocess.run`. This prevents shell interpretation and command injection vulnerabilities. In this specific case, the command could be rewritten to avoid shell and use `certbot certificates` output directly in python.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to control the `cert_name` parameter that is passed as the first command-line argument to the `https-rewrite.py` script when it is executed as part of the `SetupInstanceHttps` API call.
    - It is assumed that the `SetupInstanceHttps` API or the system invoking this script allows for the certificate name to be specified or influenced by an attacker.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/https-rewrite.py`
    - Function: `main()`
    - Line: `cert_name = argv[1]` - The script retrieves the certificate name directly from the first command-line argument without any validation or sanitization.
    - Line: `returncode, stdout, stderr = run_cmd(f'certbot certificates | grep "Certificate Name: {cert_name}" -A{LINES_AFTER} | grep "Domains: "')` - This line constructs and executes the vulnerable shell command. The `cert_name` variable is directly inserted into the command string without any escaping or sanitization, and the command is executed with `shell=True`, enabling command injection.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Prepare a test Lightsail instance where the `SetupInstanceHttps` API call can be triggered, and where you can observe the execution of `https-rewrite.py` (e.g., through logs or by monitoring system processes).
    2. **Craft Malicious `certificateName`:** Construct a malicious `certificateName` value designed to inject a command. For example: `"test-cert"; touch /tmp/pwned_https_rewrite #"`
    3. **Trigger `SetupInstanceHttps` API:** Invoke the `SetupInstanceHttps` API call, providing the crafted malicious `certificateName` as the `certificateName` parameter (assuming this parameter maps to the script's `argv[1]`).
    4. **Observe Instance:** Access the Lightsail instance via SSH or the Lightsail console and check for the presence of the file `/tmp/pwned_https_rewrite`.
    5. **Verify Command Execution:** If the file `/tmp/pwned_https_rewrite` exists, it confirms that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned_https_rewrite` was successfully executed due to the command injection vulnerability in `https-rewrite.py`.
    6. **Check Logs (Optional):** Examine the logs generated by `https-rewrite.py` (if logging is configured to capture command execution details) to further verify the execution of the injected command. You might see log entries related to the `certbot` command execution, and potentially error messages if the injected command interferes with the intended script logic.
