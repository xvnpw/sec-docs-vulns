Based on the provided vulnerability description and the instructions, the following list of vulnerabilities is generated:

### Vulnerability 1

- Vulnerability name: Insecure IAM Role Trust Policy
- Description: The `enable-irsa` command-line utility creates an IAM role with an overly permissive trust policy. The trust policy allows any AWS service ("Service": "eks.amazonaws.com") to assume the created IAM role. This violates the principle of least privilege and could allow unintended services or actors to assume the role. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially gain unauthorized access to AWS resources if they can leverage any AWS service to assume the created role.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to AWS resources. An attacker could potentially escalate privileges or access sensitive data within the AWS account.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The script as provided creates an IAM role with a wide-open trust policy.
- Missing mitigations: The IAM role's trust policy should be restricted to allow only the `aws-node` service account, within the `kube-system` namespace, of the specific EKS cluster to assume the role. This can be achieved by modifying the `create_iam_role` function to construct a more restrictive `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`.
- Preconditions: An administrator must run the `enable-irsa` utility, providing a cluster name and role name.
- Source code analysis:
  - In the file `/code/projects/enable-irsa/src/main.py`, the function `create_iam_role` defines the trust policy for the IAM role being created.
  - The `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` is hardcoded to allow any service principal `eks.amazonaws.com` to assume the role:
    ```python
    assume_role_policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  - This policy is overly broad, as it does not restrict the role assumption to a specific service account or EKS cluster, violating the principle of least privilege.
- Security test case:
  1. Execute the `enable-irsa` utility using the command: `python main.py --cluster-name test-cluster --role-name test-role`.
  2. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
  3. Find the IAM role created by the script (e.g., `test-role`).
  4. Inspect the trust policy of the created IAM role.
  5. Observe that the `Principal` section of the trust policy is set to:
     ```json
     "Principal": {
         "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
     }
     ```
  6. This confirms that the trust policy is insecurely configured, allowing any AWS service to assume the role, and validates the vulnerability.
