### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Ray Dashboard Exposure and Potential Web Vulnerabilities
- Description:
    1. The Ray Docker images built using Dockerfiles in this repository include the Ray dashboard, which is a web-based UI for monitoring and managing Ray clusters.
    2. By default, the Ray dashboard might be exposed within the Docker container and potentially accessible if the container's ports are exposed during deployment (e.g., on Amazon SageMaker).
    3. If a vulnerable version of Ray (e.g., Ray 1.6.0 as used in `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile`) is used and the dashboard is exposed, it could be susceptible to web-based attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or even Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in that Ray version's dashboard components (which may include Flask or other web technologies).
    4. An attacker who can reach the exposed Ray dashboard (e.g., if the SageMaker endpoint's security group or network configuration inadvertently allows access to the dashboard port) could exploit these web vulnerabilities.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform actions within the Ray cluster, potentially leading to:
        - **Information Disclosure**: Access to sensitive information displayed on the Ray dashboard (job details, resource utilization, etc.).
        - **Denial of Service**: Disrupting the Ray cluster's operations, causing training or inference jobs to fail.
        - **Remote Code Execution**: In the most severe cases, an attacker might be able to achieve remote code execution on the SageMaker instance hosting the Ray container, gaining full control over the environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium to High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly within the provided project files to prevent dashboard exposure or secure it. The Dockerfiles themselves do not include specific security configurations for Ray dashboard.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Disable Dashboard by Default**: The default configuration of the Ray Docker images should ideally disable the Ray dashboard to minimize the attack surface, unless explicitly required and properly secured by the user.
    - **Documentation on Securing/Disabling Dashboard**: Provide clear documentation on how users can disable the Ray dashboard or configure network access restrictions (e.g., using firewalls, security groups) if they choose to enable it.
    - **Regularly Update Ray Version**: Encourage and facilitate updating to the latest Ray versions to patch known vulnerabilities in the Ray dashboard and other components.
- Preconditions:
    1. A user builds a Ray Docker image from this repository (e.g., using `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile`).
    2. The user deploys this Docker image on Amazon SageMaker or a similar environment, potentially exposing container ports to external networks.
    3. The Ray dashboard is enabled and running within the deployed container.
    4. Network configurations (SageMaker security groups, network ACLs, etc.) are not configured to block access to the Ray dashboard port (typically 8265).
    5. The Ray version (e.g., 1.6.0) or its dashboard dependencies (e.g., Flask 1.1.1) contains exploitable web vulnerabilities.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Dockerfile Analysis (`ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile`)**:
        - The Dockerfile installs `ray==1.6.0` and `ray[tune]==1.6.0`, `ray[rllib]==1.6.0`. These versions may contain known vulnerabilities.
        - It also installs `Flask==1.1.1`, which might have security issues.
        - The `ENTRYPOINT` script `start.sh` in `ray/lib/start.sh` starts the framework but doesn't explicitly configure or disable the Ray dashboard.
    - **Ray Documentation**:
        - Review Ray documentation for version 1.6.0 to understand if the dashboard is enabled by default, on which port it runs, and if there are any security considerations or configuration options for disabling or securing it.
        - Check for known CVEs or security advisories related to Ray dashboard in version 1.6.0 or its dependencies like Flask 1.1.1.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Build Ray Docker Image**:
       ```bash
       docker build -t ray-test:1.6.0-tf-cpu -f ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile.tf --build-arg processor=cpu --build-arg suffix=ubuntu18.04 --build-arg region=us-west-2 .
       ```
    2. **Run Ray Docker Image**: Run the built Docker image, ensuring port 8265 (default Ray dashboard port) is exposed and mapped to a local port.
       ```bash
       docker run -p 8265:8265 ray-test:1.6.0-tf-cpu
       ```
    3. **Access Ray Dashboard**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8265` (or the mapped port). If the Ray dashboard is accessible, proceed to step 4.
    4. **Vulnerability Scan and Exploit Attempt**:
       - Use a web vulnerability scanner (like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto) against the Ray dashboard URL (`http://localhost:8265`) to identify potential vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, or others.
       - Manually attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities. For example, try injecting JavaScript code into dashboard input fields to test for XSS, or try to find CSRF-vulnerable actions.
       - Search for known CVEs or public exploits for Ray dashboard version 1.6.0 or Flask 1.1.1 and attempt to reproduce them against the running dashboard.
    5. **Expected Result**: If the Ray dashboard is accessible and vulnerabilities are found and exploitable, the test case is successful in demonstrating the vulnerability. If the dashboard is not accessible by default, or if no exploitable vulnerabilities are found in the dashboard for version 1.6.0, the test case might not directly prove a vulnerability from this project, but it highlights a potential risk that needs mitigation through documentation and configuration guidance.
