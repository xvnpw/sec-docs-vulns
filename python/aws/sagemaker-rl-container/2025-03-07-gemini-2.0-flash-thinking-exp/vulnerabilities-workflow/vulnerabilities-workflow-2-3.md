#### 1. Vulnerable Ray Version

* Description:
    1. The Dockerfile `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile` installs Ray version 1.6.0.
    2. Ray version 1.6.0 and earlier versions are vulnerable to multiple security issues as documented by CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-49116, CVE-2023-49117, CVE-2023-49118, CVE-2023-49119, CVE-2023-49120, CVE-2023-49121, CVE-2023-6025, CVE-2023-6026, CVE-2024-28186, CVE-2024-28187).
    3. An attacker could potentially exploit these known vulnerabilities in Ray 1.6.0 during the execution of a reinforcement learning training job in SageMaker.
    4. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the SageMaker environment, unauthorized access to resources, or other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.

* Impact:
    * High. Arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other unauthorized actions within the SageMaker environment.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The Dockerfile explicitly installs the vulnerable version of Ray.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Upgrade Ray to a version that is not affected by known CVEs. The latest stable version of Ray should be used to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

* Preconditions:
    * A SageMaker Reinforcement Learning training job is configured to use a Docker image built from `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile` or any other Dockerfile that uses a vulnerable version of Ray.
    * An attacker has the ability to influence the execution of the Ray toolkit within the SageMaker environment, for example, by providing malicious input data or configurations that trigger the Ray vulnerabilities.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```
    File: /code/ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile
    Content:
    ...
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
        ...
        ray==1.6.0 \
        ray[tune]==1.6.0 \
        ray[rllib]==1.6.0 \
        ...
    ```
    * The `Dockerfile` explicitly installs `ray==1.6.0`, `ray[tune]==1.6.0`, and `ray[rllib]==1.6.0`.
    * This hardcoded version makes the resulting Docker images vulnerable to known security issues in Ray 1.6.0.
    * During a SageMaker training job, when the Ray toolkit is initialized and used, these vulnerabilities become exploitable.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Build a Docker image using the provided `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile`.
    2. Push this Docker image to an ECR repository accessible by SageMaker.
    3. Create a SageMaker Reinforcement Learning training job using the created Docker image and the Ray toolkit.
    4. Attempt to exploit a known vulnerability in Ray 1.6.0 (e.g., by crafting a specific input or configuration based on a known CVE for Ray 1.6.0) during the training job execution.
    5. Verify if the exploit is successful, for instance, by checking for unexpected behavior, unauthorized access, or code execution within the SageMaker environment. Due to the complexity of exploiting Ray vulnerabilities, a simpler test case could involve demonstrating that a vulnerable version of Ray is indeed installed in the Docker image.
    6. Execute a command within the container to check the installed Ray version: `pip show ray | grep Version`. Verify that the installed version is 1.6.0, confirming the presence of the vulnerable software.
