### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Outdated Base Images in Dockerfiles
- Description:
  - The project provides Dockerfiles for building Reinforcement Learning containers.
  - These Dockerfiles, particularly `vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile`, `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile` and `coach/docker/$COACH_TF_TOOLKIT_VERSION/Dockerfile.tf`, specify base container images using the `FROM` instruction.
  - For example, `vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:16.04` as a base image, which is an older version of Ubuntu and may contain unpatched security vulnerabilities.
  - Similarly, `ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile` and `coach/docker/$COACH_TF_TOOLKIT_VERSION/Dockerfile.tf` rely on `sagemaker-*` base images provided by AWS Deep Learning Containers. While these are managed by AWS, they can still become outdated if not updated regularly, potentially containing known vulnerabilities.
  - If these base images are outdated and contain security vulnerabilities, any Docker images built using these Dockerfiles will inherit these vulnerabilities.
  - An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities in a SageMaker environment running containers built from these Dockerfiles to compromise the system.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in base images can lead to various security impacts.
  - An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the SageMaker environment.
  - Data breaches might occur if sensitive data is accessible within the compromised environment.
  - Malicious activities, such as running unauthorized code or disrupting services, could be performed within the SageMaker environment.
  - The overall security and integrity of the Reinforcement Learning workloads running on SageMaker could be compromised.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - No explicit mitigations for outdated base images are evident in the provided project files.
  - The build scripts (`build.sh`, `buildspec-*.yml`) do pull base images before building, but there is no process to ensure the base images themselves are regularly updated or scanned for vulnerabilities.
  - The `README.md` provides instructions on pulling base images, but this is for building purposes and doesn't address vulnerability management.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Regular Base Image Updates**: Implement a process to regularly update the base images specified in the Dockerfiles to their latest patched versions. This includes both `ubuntu:16.04` (consider upgrading to a more recent LTS version) and `sagemaker-*` images.
  - **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the Docker image build pipeline. This would help identify vulnerabilities in base images and dependencies before images are deployed. Tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore can be used for this purpose.
  - **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update system packages and Python packages within the Dockerfiles to their latest secure versions using `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` and `pip install --upgrade <package>`.
  - **Documented Security Policy**: Create and document a security policy that outlines the process for base image management, vulnerability scanning, and patching within this project.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to target a SageMaker environment that is running Docker containers built using the provided Dockerfiles.
  - The base images used in the Dockerfiles must contain known, exploitable security vulnerabilities.
  - The vulnerabilities must not be mitigated by other security controls in the SageMaker environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - **`vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile`**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM ubuntu:16.04
    ```
    - This Dockerfile directly uses `ubuntu:16.04` as the base image. Ubuntu 16.04 reached the end of standard support in April 2021 and end of extended security maintenance (ESM) in April 2024. Using an outdated base image like this directly introduces known vulnerabilities into the Docker image.
  - **`ray/docker/1.6.0/Dockerfile`**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM 763104351884.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${FRAMEWORK}-training:${VERSION}-${CPU_OR_GPU}-${SUFFIX}
    ```
    - This Dockerfile and similar Dockerfiles for Coach rely on `sagemaker-*` base images. While the specific Dockerfile pulls the latest based on provided ARGs, there is no guarantee that these `sagemaker-*` base images are always updated with the latest security patches by the maintainers of those images (AWS Deep Learning Containers team).
    - The project does not have explicit mechanisms to verify the freshness or security status of these `sagemaker-*` base images.
  - **Build Scripts (`buildspec-*.yml`, `scripts/build.sh`)**:
    - The build scripts primarily focus on building and publishing the Docker images.
    - They include steps to pull base images:
      ```bash
      docker pull $BASE_IMAGE_ECR_REPO:$VW_BASE_TAG
      ```
      or
      ```bash
      docker pull $TF_IMAGE:$RAY_TF_CPU_BASE_TAG
      ```
    - While these commands pull the base images, they do not inherently ensure that the *latest secure* versions are used. If the tags used in these scripts point to older, vulnerable versions, the built images will inherit those vulnerabilities.
    - There is no vulnerability scanning or base image update enforcement in these scripts.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Identify Vulnerable Base Image**: Choose a specific Dockerfile, for example `vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile`, which uses `ubuntu:16.04`.
  2. **Scan Base Image for Vulnerabilities**: Use a vulnerability scanning tool like Trivy to scan the `ubuntu:16.04` base image:
     ```bash
     docker pull ubuntu:16.04
     trivy image ubuntu:16.04
     ```
     - Trivy will likely report numerous HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities in `ubuntu:16.04` due to its age and end-of-life status.
  3. **Build Docker Image**: Build a Docker image using `vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile`:
     ```bash
     docker build -t vulnerable-vw-image -f vw/docker/8.7.0/Dockerfile .
     ```
  4. **Scan Built Docker Image**: Scan the newly built `vulnerable-vw-image` using Trivy:
     ```bash
     trivy image vulnerable-vw-image
     ```
     - The scan should show that `vulnerable-vw-image` inherits the vulnerabilities from the `ubuntu:16.04` base image.
  5. **(Optional) Exploit Vulnerability (Proof of Concept)**:
     - If the vulnerability scan identifies an easily exploitable vulnerability (e.g., a publicly known exploit for a service running in the base image), attempt to demonstrate a proof-of-concept exploit. This might involve deploying the `vulnerable-vw-image` to a test SageMaker environment (or a local Docker environment mimicking SageMaker) and attempting to trigger the vulnerability from an external attacker's perspective. (Note: Ethical considerations apply; only perform this in a controlled test environment with explicit permission).
  6. **Report Findings**: Document the identified vulnerabilities, the scan results, and (if applicable) the proof-of-concept exploit to demonstrate the validity and impact of the "Outdated Base Images" vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how easily vulnerabilities from outdated base images can be inherited by the Docker images built by this project, highlighting the risk to SageMaker environments using these containers.
