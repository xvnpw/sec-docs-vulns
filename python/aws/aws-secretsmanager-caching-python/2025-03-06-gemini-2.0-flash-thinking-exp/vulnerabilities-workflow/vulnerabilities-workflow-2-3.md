### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: In-Memory Secret Exposure

- Description:
  - An attacker who gains access to the memory space of a Python application using this library can potentially extract secrets stored in the in-process cache.
  - Step 1: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the memory of the Python process where the `aws-secretsmanager-caching-python` library is running. This could be achieved through various methods depending on the environment, such as:
    - Memory dumping tools if the attacker has local access to the machine or container.
    - Process inspection techniques if the attacker can execute code within the same environment (e.g., in a containerized environment or through compromised application code).
  - Step 2: The attacker scans the memory space for string or byte patterns that are likely to be secrets. Since the library stores secrets as Python string or bytes objects in the LRU cache without default encryption, the secrets will be present in plaintext in memory.
  - Step 3: The attacker extracts the identified secret data from the memory dump or process inspection results.
  - Step 4: The attacker can now use the extracted secrets for unauthorized access to systems or data protected by these secrets.

- Impact:
  - Exposure of sensitive secrets managed by AWS Secrets Manager.
  - Unauthorized access to protected resources or systems that rely on these secrets for authentication or authorization.
  - Potential data breaches, privilege escalation, and other security compromises depending on the nature and scope of the exposed secrets.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None by default. The library does not implement any built-in mechanisms to encrypt or protect secrets in memory.
  - The `SecretCacheHook` interface in `src/aws_secretsmanager_caching/cache/secret_cache_hook.py` allows developers to implement custom encryption/decryption logic for cached secrets. However, this is not a default or mandatory feature.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Default in-memory encryption of cached secrets. The library should ideally provide an option (or enforce) encryption of secrets before storing them in the LRU cache.
  - Secure memory handling practices to minimize the risk of secrets being exposed in memory dumps (though this is generally complex in Python).
  - Clear documentation and warnings about the risks of in-memory caching of sensitive secrets, especially without encryption, and guidance on using `SecretCacheHook` for implementing encryption.

- Preconditions:
  - The application must be using the `aws-secretsmanager-caching-python` library to cache secrets in memory.
  - An attacker must be able to gain access to the memory space of the running Python process. This could be through local access, container escape, or compromised application code that allows memory inspection.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **`src/aws_secretsmanager_caching/cache/lru.py`**: This file implements the LRU cache. The `LRUCache` class stores `LRUItem` objects in a dictionary `self._cache`. `LRUItem` holds the actual secret data in `self.data`.
  ```python
  class LRUCache:
      # ...
      def __init__(self, max_size=1024):
          # ...
          self._cache = {} # Dictionary to store cached items
          # ...

      def put_if_absent(self, key, data):
          # ...
          item = LRUItem(key=key, data=data) # 'data' is the secret, stored in LRUItem
          self._cache[key] = item
          # ...

      def get(self, key):
          # ...
          item = self._cache[key]
          return item.data # Returns the secret data
  ```
  - **`src/aws_secretsmanager_caching/cache/items.py`**: `SecretCacheItem` and `SecretCacheVersion` classes retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and store them. The `_set_result` method stores the retrieved secret value into `self._result`.
  ```python
  class SecretCacheObject:
      # ...
      def __init__(self, config, client, secret_id):
          # ...
          self._result = None # Stores the secret value
          # ...

      def _set_result(self, result):
          """Store the given result using a hook if present"""
          if self._config.secret_cache_hook is None:
              self._result = result # Secret is directly stored without encryption if no hook is used
              return

          self._result = self._config.secret_cache_hook.put(result) # Hook might encrypt, but is optional

      def _get_result(self):
          """Get the stored result using a hook if present"""
          if self._config.secret_cache_hook is None:
              return self._result # Secret is directly returned without decryption if no hook is used

          return self._config.secret_cache_hook.get(self._result) # Hook might decrypt, but is optional
  ```
  - **`src/aws_secretsmanager_caching/secret_cache.py`**: `SecretCache` class uses `LRUCache` to store `SecretCacheItem` objects. The `get_secret_string` and `get_secret_binary` methods retrieve secrets from the cache.
  ```python
  class SecretCache:
      # ...
      def __init__(self, config=SecretCacheConfig(), client=None):
          # ...
          self._cache = LRUCache(max_size=self._config.max_cache_size) # LRU Cache is initialized
          # ...

      def _get_cached_secret(self, secret_id):
          # ...
          secret = self._cache.get(secret_id) # Get SecretCacheItem from LRU Cache
          # ...
          return self._cache.get(secret_id)

      def get_secret_string(self, secret_id, version_stage=None):
          # ...
          secret = self._get_cached_secret(secret_id).get_secret_value(version_stage) # Retrieve secret value
          if secret is None:
              return secret
          return secret.get("SecretString") # SecretString is returned in plaintext
  ```
  - **Visualization**:
    ```
    [Python Application] --> [SecretCache Object] --> [LRUCache] --> [LRUItem] --> [Secret Data (Plaintext in Memory)]
    ```
    The secret data flows from AWS Secrets Manager, through the caching layers, and is finally stored in `LRUItem.data` within the `LRUCache`. Without a `SecretCacheHook` to encrypt, this data remains in plaintext in the application's memory.

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Set up a Python application that uses `aws-secretsmanager-caching-python` to retrieve and cache a secret from AWS Secrets Manager.
    ```python
    import botocore.session
    from aws_secretsmanager_caching import SecretCache

    # Replace 'your-secret-name' with an actual secret name in your AWS Secrets Manager
    secret_name = 'your-secret-name'

    client = botocore.session.get_session().create_client('secretsmanager', region_name='us-west-2') # Or your region
    cache = SecretCache(client=client)

    secret_value = cache.get_secret_string(secret_name)
    print(f"Retrieved secret: {secret_value}")

    # Keep the process running to allow for memory inspection
    input("Press Enter to continue and allow memory inspection...")
    ```
  - Step 2: Run the Python application. Ensure that the secret is successfully retrieved and cached (you should see "Retrieved secret: ..." printed).
  - Step 3: While the Python application is running, use a memory dumping tool (e.g., `gcore` on Linux, or process explorer/memory dump features on Windows) to create a memory dump of the running Python process.
    - For example, on Linux, find the PID of the Python process and run: `gcore <PID>`.
  - Step 4: Analyze the memory dump file using a text editor or memory analysis tool (e.g., `strings` command on Linux, or memory analysis plugins in debuggers).
  - Step 5: Search for the plaintext secret value within the memory dump file. You should be able to find the secret string that was retrieved and cached by the application, demonstrating that it is stored in plaintext in memory.
  - Step 6: (Optional) To further validate, modify the test case to use `SecretCacheHook` to encrypt/decrypt the secret and repeat steps 3-5. You should then not be able to find the plaintext secret in the memory dump, or only find the encrypted version if the hook is implemented correctly.

This test case demonstrates the vulnerability by showing that secrets cached using `aws-secretsmanager-caching-python` are present in plaintext in the process memory and can be extracted using memory dumping techniques.
