### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Notebook Conversion Code Injection
- Description:
    1. A malicious user crafts a Jupyter notebook containing a code cell with specially designed content.
    2. The user scans this notebook using the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension.
    3. The extension utilizes `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` to convert the notebook into a Python script for analysis.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization during the conversion process, malicious code from the notebook is directly embedded into the generated Python script.
    5. While the injected code is not directly executed by the CodeGuru scan itself, the generated Python file now contains attacker-controlled code.
    6. If this generated Python file is subsequently executed or processed by the user or another tool, the injected malicious code will be executed, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the user's environment.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution in the user's JupyterLab environment or any environment where the generated Python file is executed. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities depending on the injected code.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `is_command` function in `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` attempts to comment out lines starting with certain shell commands (`cd`, `ls`, `pip`).
    - Mitigation location: `/code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py`
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust input sanitization and validation of notebook cell content before incorporating it into the generated Python script.
    - Use of secure code generation techniques that prevent code injection vulnerabilities. For example, using AST manipulation instead of string concatenation to build the Python script.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the notebook conversion process to limit the impact of potential code injection.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must install and use the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension.
    - The user must scan a maliciously crafted Jupyter notebook using the extension.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py`
    2. Function: `run(inp, out)`
    3. The code iterates through notebook cells and extracts code from 'code' cells:
    ```python
    for cell in cells:
      if cell['cell_type'] == 'code':
        code = cell['source']
        codeStr = ""
        for c in code:
            codeStr+=c
        cellCode = ipython2python(codeStr)
        cellCode = cellCode.rstrip(cellCode[-1])# remove the last line break
        if len(code) == 1: # handle single line command
          if is_command(code[0]):
            cellCode = 'pass #' + cellCode
    ```
    4. The extracted `cellCode` is directly appended to the `notebookScript` string:
    ```python
    for cm in cellMetaWithEC: # append executed code cells.
        notebookScript += '__CELL_EDGE__('+str(cm[0])+')\n'+cm[2]+'\n'
    for cm in cellMetaWoEC: # append unexecuted code cells in the end.
        notebookScript += '__CELL_EDGE__('+str(cm[0])+')\n'+cm[2]+'\n'
    ```
    5. **Vulnerability:** The direct string concatenation of `cellCode` into `notebookScript` without proper sanitization allows for code injection. If a malicious notebook provides code within a cell that is designed to be interpreted as code when concatenated, it will be injected into the final Python script. The `is_command` function provides a very basic and easily bypassable attempt at mitigation.
    6. Visualization:
    ```
    Notebook Cell Content (Malicious) --> parseNotebookIntoScript.py --> Python Script (INJECTED CODE)
                                        |
                                        Vulnerable String Concatenation
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a file named `malicious.ipynb` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
     "cells": [
      {
       "cell_type": "code",
       "execution_count": null,
       "metadata": {},
       "outputs": [],
       "source": [
        "import os\n",
        "os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')"
       ]
      }
     ],
     "metadata": {
      "kernelspec": {
       "display_name": "Python 3",
       "language": "python",
       "name": "python3"
      },
      "language_info": {
       "codemirror_mode": {
        "name": "ipython",
        "version": 3
       },
       "file_extension": ".py",
       "mimetype": "text/x-python",
       "name": "python",
       "nbconvert_exporter": "python",
       "pygments_lexer": "ipython3",
       "version": "3.8.5"
      }
     },
     "nbformat": 4,
     "nbformat_minor": 4
    }
    ```
    2. Execute the `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` script from the command line, providing the malicious notebook as input and an output file:
    ```sh
    python /code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py malicious.ipynb malicious.py
    ```
    3. Examine the generated `malicious.py` file. It should contain the injected code:
    ```python
    def __CELL_EDGE__(x):
    	pass
    __CELL_EDGE__(0)
    import os
    os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')
    ```
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, the code injection and arbitrary code execution are successful.
    ```sh
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```
    5. Expected result: The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created, demonstrating that the code injected through the malicious notebook was executed when the generated Python script was (hypothetically) run. This confirms the Notebook Conversion Code Injection vulnerability.
