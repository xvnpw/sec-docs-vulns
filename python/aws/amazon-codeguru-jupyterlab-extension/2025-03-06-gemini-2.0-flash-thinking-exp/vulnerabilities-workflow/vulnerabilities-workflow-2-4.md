- ### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection in Notebook Conversion

- Description:
    1. The `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` script converts Jupyter Notebook cells into Python scripts for analysis by Amazon CodeGuru Security.
    2. The `is_command` function in `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` attempts to detect and neutralize potentially harmful shell commands within notebook cells by checking if a line starts with `cd`, `ls`, or `pip`.
    3. If a command is detected, it is commented out in the generated Python script using `pass #`.
    4. However, this command detection is very basic and can be easily bypassed by using alternative shell command execution methods or different commands not in the limited list.
    5. An attacker can craft a malicious Jupyter notebook with a code cell containing shell commands that are not recognized by `is_command`, such as `!bash -c "malicious command"` or `import os; os.system("malicious command")`.
    6. When the CodeGuru extension scans this malicious notebook, `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` processes the notebook and generates a Python script that includes the attacker's injected shell commands without proper sanitization.
    7. When this generated Python script is processed by the CodeGuru Security service (or potentially during intermediate processing steps within the extension itself), the injected commands are executed on the server where JupyterLab is running.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine or the server where JupyterLab is running.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control of the system, access sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `is_command` function in `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` attempts to mitigate command execution by checking for `cd`, `ls`, and `pip` commands and commenting them out. This is located in `/code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py`.
    - However, this mitigation is insufficient as it only covers a limited set of commands and can be easily bypassed.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization to remove or neutralize any potentially harmful shell commands or code constructs within notebook cells before converting them to Python.
    - Sandboxing: Execute the notebook conversion and analysis process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any successful command injection.
    - Secure code execution: Employ secure code execution practices during notebook processing and analysis to prevent unintended command execution.
    - Blocklist/Allowlist refinement: Expand the blocklist of commands or create an allowlist of safe operations within notebook cells to restrict potentially dangerous functionalities.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): While CSP is mentioned in `/code/tests/fixtures/converted.py`, it is related to web application security and not directly to backend command injection in notebook conversion. CSP headers are designed to prevent client-side attacks in web browsers, not server-side command injection.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Jupyter notebook.
    - The user must open and scan the malicious notebook using the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py`
    2. **Function:** `is_command(line)`
    ```python
    commands = ['cd', 'ls', 'pip']
    def is_command(line):
      for command in commands:
        if line.lstrip().startswith(command):
          return True
      return False
    ```
    This function defines a limited list of `commands = ['cd', 'ls', 'pip']`.
    It checks if a line starts with any of these commands after stripping leading whitespace.
    3. **Function:** `run(inp, out)`
    ```python
        for cell in cells:
          if cell['cell_type'] == 'code':
            code = cell['source']
            codeStr = ""
            for c in code:
                codeStr+=c
            cellCode = ipython2python(codeStr)
            cellCode = cellCode.rstrip(cellCode[-1])# remove the last line break
            if len(code) == 1: # handle single line command
              if is_command(code[0]):
                cellCode = 'pass #' + cellCode
    ```
    In the `run` function, for each code cell, it iterates through the lines of code.
    If a cell contains only one line (`len(code) == 1`) and `is_command(code[0])` returns true, it prepends `pass #` to `cellCode`, effectively commenting out the detected command in the generated Python script.
    4. **Vulnerability:** The `is_command` function only checks for a very limited set of commands. Attackers can easily bypass this by using other commands or methods to execute shell commands within a notebook cell. For example, using magic commands like `!`, `%%bash`, or Python's `os` module. These methods are not checked by `is_command` and will be directly included in the generated Python script, leading to potential command injection when the script is processed.

- Security test case:
    1. **Create a malicious Jupyter Notebook:** Create a new Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `malicious_notebook.ipynb`).
    2. **Add a code cell with a command injection payload:** In the first cell, add the following Python code which uses a magic command to execute a shell command:
    ```python
    !touch /tmp/codeguru_pwned
    ```
    This command attempts to create a file named `codeguru_pwned` in the `/tmp` directory on the server.
    3. **Save the Notebook:** Save the notebook as `malicious_notebook.ipynb`.
    4. **Open JupyterLab with the extension installed:** Ensure the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension is installed and enabled in your JupyterLab environment.
    5. **Open the malicious notebook:** Open `malicious_notebook.ipynb` in JupyterLab.
    6. **Run CodeGuru Scan:** Trigger a CodeGuru Security scan on the `malicious_notebook.ipynb` file using the extension's scan functionality.
    7. **Check for file creation:** After initiating the scan, check if the file `/tmp/codeguru_pwned` has been created on the server where JupyterLab is running. You might need shell access to the JupyterLab server to verify this.
    8. **Verification:** If the file `/tmp/codeguru_pwned` exists in the `/tmp` directory, it confirms that the `!touch /tmp/codeguru_pwned` command from the notebook was executed on the server, demonstrating a successful command injection vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that the rudimentary command filtering is insufficient and allows for command injection through notebook magic commands.
