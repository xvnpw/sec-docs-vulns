- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Notebook Conversion
- Description:
    An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into a Jupyter notebook that will be executed on the user's machine during the notebook scanning process. This is due to insufficient sanitization of notebook cell content when converting it to a Python script for analysis by Amazon CodeGuru Security. Specifically, the `is_command` function in `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` attempts to identify and comment out specific shell commands (`cd`, `ls`, `pip`). However, this function is easily bypassed, allowing malicious commands to be embedded in a notebook cell and executed when the notebook is processed.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Create a Jupyter notebook.
    2. In a code cell, insert a shell command disguised to bypass the `is_command` check. For example, instead of `!ls`, use a variation like  `'l' + 's'` or backticks `` `ls` ``.
    3. Save the notebook.
    4. Trigger a scan of the notebook using the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension.
    5. The `parseNotebookIntoScript.py` script will convert the notebook to a Python script. Due to the bypassed command detection, the disguised shell command will not be commented out.
    6. When the generated Python script is executed (implicitly or explicitly during some stage of the scanning process, although not directly executed by the extension itself, the vulnerability lies in the potential for misinterpretation or execution by underlying tools or user actions based on the generated script), the injected shell command will be executed on the user's machine. While the extension doesn't directly execute the generated script, the presence of unsanitized commands in the generated script poses a significant risk, as users or automated processes might inadvertently execute it, or security tools might flag it, causing confusion and potential misdiagnosis. The core issue is the creation of a Python script with embedded, executable shell commands originating from user-controlled notebook content.
- Impact:
    Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system by crafting a malicious notebook. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or further exploitation of the user's environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The project attempts to mitigate command execution by identifying and commenting out specific commands in the `is_command` function within `parseNotebookIntoScript.py`.
    ```python
    commands = ['cd', 'ls', 'pip']
    def is_command(line):
      for command in commands:
        if line.lstrip().startswith(command):
          return True
      return False
    ```
    This mitigation is insufficient as it relies on a simple string prefix check against a limited list of commands, which can be easily bypassed.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust sanitization of notebook cell content to prevent injection of shell commands. Instead of trying to identify and comment out specific commands, the code should either:
        -  Completely disallow shell commands in notebooks processed by the extension.
        -  Use a secure method to execute allowed commands in a sandboxed environment, preventing arbitrary code execution.
        -  Properly escape or remove any characters or patterns that could be interpreted as shell commands during the conversion to Python.
    - Input validation: Thoroughly validate the content of the Jupyter notebook before processing it.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension and any processes it invokes run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful exploit.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must install and enable the Amazon CodeGuru JupyterLab extension.
    - The user must open and scan a malicious Jupyter notebook crafted by an attacker.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/amazon_codeguru_jupyterlab_extension/parseNotebookIntoScript.py`
    2. Function: `is_command(line)`
       ```python
       commands = ['cd', 'ls', 'pip']
       def is_command(line):
         for command in commands:
           if line.lstrip().startswith(command):
             return True
         return False
       ```
       This function checks if a line starts with `cd`, `ls`, or `pip` after stripping leading whitespace.
    3. Function: `run(inp, out)`
       ```python
       def run(inp, out):
         with open(inp,'r') as red:
           notebook = json.load(red)
           cells = notebook['cells']
           notebookScript = 'def __CELL_EDGE__(x):\n\tpass\n'
           cellMetaWithEC = [] # cells with execution count
           cellMetaWoEC = [] # cells without execution count
           cellnum = 0
           for cell in cells:
             if cell['cell_type'] == 'code':
               code = cell['source']
               codeStr = ""
               for c in code:
                   codeStr+=c
               cellCode = ipython2python(codeStr)
               cellCode = cellCode.rstrip(cellCode[-1])# remove the last line break
               if len(code) == 1: # handle single line command
                 if is_command(code[0]):
                   cellCode = 'pass #' + cellCode # Comment out identified commands
               if cell['execution_count'] is None:
                 cellMetaWoEC.append((cellnum, -1, cellCode))
               else:
                 cellMetaWithEC.append((cellnum, cell['execution_count'], cellCode))
               cellnum += 1
           # ... (rest of the function) ...
       ```
       The `run` function iterates through notebook cells, extracts code, converts IPython syntax to Python, and then calls `is_command` to check for specific commands. If a command is detected, it prepends `pass #` to comment it out.
    4. Vulnerability: The `is_command` function is easily bypassed. An attacker can use string manipulation or other shell command invocation methods that are not in the `commands` list to inject and execute arbitrary commands. For example, using backticks `` `whoami` `` or other command injection techniques will not be detected by `is_command`. The `ipython2python` function might also transform or interpret certain notebook constructs in a way that leads to unintended command execution in the generated python script context.  Although the extension doesn't directly execute this generated python script, the vulnerability lies in creating a file with user-controlled, executable commands, which is a security risk.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new Jupyter notebook named `malicious_notebook.ipynb`.
    2. Add a new code cell with the following content:
       ```python
       import os
       os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')
       ````
    3. Save the notebook.
    4. Open the JupyterLab instance with the Amazon CodeGuru extension installed.
    5. Open the `malicious_notebook.ipynb`.
    6. Trigger a scan of this notebook by executing the "Run Scan" command from the extension.
    7. After the scan process completes (or even during it, depending on when the conversion happens), check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system where JupyterLab is running.
    8. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates that the `os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')` command was executed, proving the command injection vulnerability.

    Alternatively, to demonstrate bypassing `is_command` more directly (although `os.system` is already a direct bypass in this context):

    1. Create a new Jupyter notebook named `malicious_notebook_cmd_injection.ipynb`.
    2. Add a new code cell with the following content:
       ```python
       `whoami > /tmp/whoami_output.txt`
       ```
    3. Save the notebook.
    4. Open the JupyterLab instance with the Amazon CodeGuru extension installed.
    5. Open the `malicious_notebook_cmd_injection.ipynb`.
    6. Trigger a scan of this notebook.
    7. After the scan, check if the file `/tmp/whoami_output.txt` exists in the `/tmp` directory and contains the output of the `whoami` command. This would demonstrate that backtick command execution bypassed the `is_command` check and allowed shell command injection.
