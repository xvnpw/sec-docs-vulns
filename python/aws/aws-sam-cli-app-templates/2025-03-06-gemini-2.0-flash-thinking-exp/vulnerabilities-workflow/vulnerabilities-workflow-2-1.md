## Vulnerability List for AWS SAM CLI Application Templates

### Vulnerability 1: Malicious Code Injection via Cookiecutter Templates

* **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Code Injection via Cookiecutter Templates
* **Description:**
    1. A malicious actor crafts a cookiecutter template.
    2. This template contains malicious code embedded within Jinja2 templating directives. For example, the template could include code to execute system commands or exfiltrate data.
    3. A developer, unknowingly or through social engineering, uses the `sam init` command with the `--location` parameter, pointing to the malicious template repository (e.g., `sam init --no-input --location <URL_TO_MALICIOUS_TEMPLATE> --name test-project`).
    4. SAM CLI fetches the template and utilizes `cookiecutter` to render the template files based on user inputs or default configurations.
    5. During the template rendering process, `cookiecutter` executes the malicious code embedded in the Jinja2 directives within the template files.
    6. This leads to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
* **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - Data theft: Sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, source code, or personal data, can be stolen from the developer's machine.
        - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware, backdoors, or ransomware on the developer's system.
        - System compromise: Complete compromise of the developer's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to pivot to other systems or networks accessible from the compromised machine.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None in the project files. The project relies on users to use templates from trusted sources.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization: The `sam init` process should validate and sanitize template content to prevent the execution of arbitrary code. This could involve scanning templates for suspicious code patterns or disallowing certain Jinja2 features.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: The template rendering process should be sandboxed or isolated to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution. This could involve running `cookiecutter` in a restricted environment with limited system access.
    - Template Code Review and Security Audits: Templates within the official repository should undergo rigorous code review and security audits to identify and eliminate any potential malicious code or vulnerabilities.
    - Developer Warnings and Documentation: Implement clear warnings and documentation within SAM CLI and the application template repository, educating developers about the risks of using templates from untrusted sources and the importance of verifying template integrity.
* **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must execute the `sam init` command.
    - The `sam init` command must use the `--location` parameter to specify a template source.
    - The specified template source must be malicious or compromised.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    The provided project files consist mainly of test code, example lambda function code, and configuration files for various application templates. They do not include the source code for the SAM CLI or the `sam init` command. Therefore, direct source code analysis of the vulnerability within these files is not possible.

    However, the vulnerability stems from the inherent behavior of `cookiecutter` and Jinja2 templating, as leveraged by `sam init`. The `sam init` command, as described in `/code/README.md` and template-specific README.md files (not provided in PROJECT FILES, but assumed from context), uses `cookiecutter` to generate projects from templates.  The `cookiecutter` tool, using the Jinja2 templating engine, can interpret and execute code embedded within templates.

    For example, the following code snippet in a template file could execute arbitrary Python code during `cookiecutter` rendering:

    ```
    {{ '{{' }} import os; os.system('malicious_command') {{ '}}' }}
    ```

    When `sam init` processes a template containing such code, `cookiecutter` will execute the `os.system('malicious_command')` on the developer's machine, leading to code execution vulnerability.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a malicious cookiecutter template repository:**
        - Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `malicious-sam-template`).
        - Create a `cookiecutter.json` file with basic template information.
        - Create a template file (e.g., `hello_world/app.py`) containing malicious code within Jinja2 delimiters:

        ```
        # hello_world/app.py (malicious template file)
        import os
        import json

        def lambda_handler(event, context):
            {{ '{{' }} import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_template_injection') {{ '}}' }}
            return {
                "statusCode": 200,
                "body": json.dumps({
                    "message": "Hello from SAM!",
                }),
            }
        ```
        - Commit and push these files to the `malicious-sam-template` repository.

    2. **Prepare a test machine:**
        - Set up a clean test machine with AWS SAM CLI installed.

    3. **Execute `sam init` with the malicious template:**
        - Run the following command in the test machine's terminal, replacing `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username where you hosted the malicious template:

        ```bash
        sam init --no-input --location https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/malicious-sam-template --name test-project-malicious
        ```

    4. **Verify malicious code execution:**
        - After the `sam init` command completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_template_injection` exists on the test machine.

        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned_template_injection
        ```

        - If the file `pwned_template_injection` exists in the `/tmp` directory, it indicates that the malicious code within the cookiecutter template was successfully executed during `sam init`, confirming the vulnerability.
