### Vulnerabilities List

- Vulnerability name: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Example Code
    - Description:
        1. The `README.md` file contains example code snippets demonstrating how to use the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin for AWS SigV4 authentication.
        2. These examples, found under sections like "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session" and "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials", include hardcoded AWS access key ID (`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`), secret access key (`wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`), and session token (`AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>`).
        3. Developers, especially those new to AWS or quickly implementing the plugin, might refer to these examples for guidance and copy-paste the code directly into their application code.
        4. Unaware of the security implications or failing to replace the example credentials, developers might unintentionally use these hardcoded example credentials or, even worse, replace the placeholders with their *actual* AWS credentials directly within the code.
        5. This results in hardcoded AWS credentials being embedded within their applications, which can then be exposed through various means such as public code repositories, accessible application deployments, or inadvertently shared configuration files.
        6. An attacker can discover these exposed credentials by scanning public repositories, accessing the application's codebase or execution environment, or through other means of information gathering.
        7. Once the attacker obtains these credentials, they can use them to authenticate to the associated AWS account and resources, specifically Amazon Keyspaces instances.
    - Impact: Full compromise of AWS account and resources, specifically Amazon Keyspaces, if the hardcoded credentials have sufficient permissions. This can lead to:
        - Data breaches: Sensitive data stored in Amazon Keyspaces could be accessed, stolen, modified, or deleted.
        - Resource hijacking: Amazon Keyspaces resources could be used for malicious purposes, leading to unexpected AWS charges.
        - Financial losses: Unauthorized usage of AWS resources and potential regulatory fines due to data breaches.
        - Reputational damage: Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation due to security incidents.
    - Vulnerability rank: Critical
    - Currently implemented mitigations:
        - None. The README provides example code with explicitly hardcoded credentials without any warning or best practice advice against doing so. The example credentials include the string "EXAMPLE", which is a weak attempt at indicating they are placeholders, but it is insufficient as users might overlook this or not understand the security implications.
    - Missing mitigations:
        - **Security Warning in README:** Add a prominent and explicit warning in the `README.md` file, especially within and around the example usage sections and right before the code blocks containing hardcoded credentials. This warning should strongly advise users against hardcoding AWS credentials in production environments, highlight the severe security risks, and direct them to secure credential management practices.
        - **Best Practices Documentation:** Include a dedicated section in the `README.md` or a separate documentation file detailing best practices for managing AWS credentials when using this plugin. This section should recommend and explain secure alternatives such as using environment variables, AWS configuration files, IAM roles, AWS Secrets Manager, or the Boto3 default credential provider chain, linking to official AWS documentation on credential security.
        - **Secure Example Code:** Modify the example code in the `README.md` to demonstrate secure credential handling. Replace hardcoded credentials with clear placeholder values that are obviously not valid credentials and cannot be misinterpreted as such (e.g., `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`, `<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`, `<YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>`).  Alternatively, show how to initialize a `boto3.Session` without explicitly passing credentials, relying on default credential providers or environment variables for configuration, and emphasize this secure approach in the documentation.
        - **Code Review and Static Analysis Recommendations:** In the documentation, advise users to perform code reviews and use static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials before deploying their applications.
    - Preconditions:
        - A developer uses the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin to connect to Amazon Keyspaces and refers to the `README.md` file for example usage.
        - The developer copies the example code from the `README.md` as a template for implementing the authentication plugin.
        - The developer fails to recognize the hardcoded credentials as placeholders, is not fully aware of the security risks of hardcoding credentials, or does not follow secure coding practices.
        - The developer exposes the application code containing hardcoded credentials in a public repository (e.g., GitHub), accessible environment, or publicly shared configuration files.
    - Source code analysis:
        - **File: `/code/README.md`**
        - The `README.md` file contains example code blocks under sections such as "Example Usage", "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session", and "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials".
        - These code blocks directly instantiate `boto3.Session` and `SigV4AuthProvider` with hardcoded values for `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `aws_session_token`. For example:
        ```python
        boto_session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                     aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                     aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                     region_name="us-east-2")
        auth_provider = SigV4AuthProvider(boto_session)
        ```
        ```python
        auth_provider = SigV4AuthProvider(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                          aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                          aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                          region_name="us-east-2")
        ```
        - The use of `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` and `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` as example credentials, without prominent warnings, creates a vulnerability by potentially misleading developers into believing it is acceptable or safe to hardcode their own credentials similarly, especially those unfamiliar with AWS security best practices. The documentation lacks sufficient cautionary advice directly adjacent to these code examples about the severe security risks of hardcoding credentials.
        - **File: `/code/cassandra_sigv4/auth.py`**
        - The `SigV4AuthProvider` class constructor in `auth.py` is designed to accept AWS credentials directly as parameters: `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `aws_session_token`. While this design is necessary for programmatic credential provision, it directly enables the insecure practice of hardcoding credentials if developers use these parameters with literal string values, especially when following the vulnerable `README.md` examples.
    - Security test case:
        1. **Setup:**
            - Assume an attacker has access to the project's `README.md` file (publicly available on GitHub).
            - A developer, "VulnerableDev", intends to use the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin in their application.
            - VulnerableDev refers to the `README.md` for example usage and copies the example code directly.
            - VulnerableDev naively replaces the example placeholder credentials in the code with their *actual* AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for their AWS account, directly embedding them as strings in their application code.
            - VulnerableDev commits this application code, including the hardcoded AWS credentials, to a public Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).
        2. **Attack:**
            - The attacker discovers VulnerableDev's public Git repository.
            - The attacker browses the repository's code and identifies the file where VulnerableDev implemented the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin, finding the hardcoded AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key within the code.
            - The attacker copies the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
            - The attacker configures the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on their local machine using the stolen credentials: `aws configure`.
            - The attacker uses the AWS CLI to attempt to access VulnerableDev's Amazon Keyspaces resources, for example, by listing keyspaces: `aws keyspaces list-keyspaces --region <VulnerableDev's Keyspaces region>`.
        3. **Expected Outcome:**
            - If VulnerableDev has hardcoded valid, active AWS credentials, the attacker will successfully authenticate to VulnerableDev's AWS account using the stolen credentials.
            - The attacker will be able to list keyspaces and potentially perform other actions on VulnerableDev's Amazon Keyspaces instance, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised AWS credentials. This demonstrates successful unauthorized access due to hardcoded credentials.
        4. **Alternative Test Case (Demonstrating Vulnerability in Code):**
            - Create a Python virtual environment and install necessary libraries (`cassandra-sigv4`, `cassandra-driver`, `boto3`).
            - Create a Python script (`test_hardcoded_creds.py`) and copy the "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session" example code from `README.md` into it.
            - Run the script: `python test_hardcoded_creds.py`.
        5. **Expected Outcome (Alternative Test Case):**
            - The script will attempt to establish a connection to Amazon Keyspaces using the hardcoded credentials. Even if the connection fails with the example credentials, the test confirms that the code utilizes hardcoded credentials for authentication as presented in the example, highlighting the vulnerability. Replacing the example credentials with valid AWS credentials would allow successful connection, further proving the risk if real credentials were unintentionally hardcoded.
