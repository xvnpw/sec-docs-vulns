### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Example Code
- Description:
    - The `README.md` file provides example code demonstrating how to use the `cassandra-sigv4` library.
    - This example code includes hardcoded AWS access keys (`aws_access_key_id`) and secret keys (`aws_secret_access_key`) within the `boto3.Session` initialization.
    - A user might copy and paste this example code directly into their production application without realizing the security implications of using hardcoded credentials.
    - If the user deploys this code to production, the hardcoded AWS credentials will be exposed within their application.
    - An attacker who gains access to the application's codebase or execution environment (e.g., through code repository access, server compromise, or even accidentally committing the code to a public repository) can extract these credentials.
    - With the extracted AWS credentials, the attacker can then authenticate to Amazon Keyspaces and potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's Cassandra data.
- Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Access to Amazon Keyspaces**: Attackers can use the exposed AWS credentials to authenticate as the legitimate user to Amazon Keyspaces.
    - **Data Breach**: Once authenticated, attackers can read, modify, or delete data stored in Amazon Keyspaces, leading to a data breach.
    - **Data Manipulation**: Attackers might manipulate data for malicious purposes, causing data integrity issues.
    - **Resource Abuse**: Attackers could abuse the Amazon Keyspaces resources associated with the compromised credentials, potentially incurring costs for the legitimate user.
    - **Reputational Damage**: A data breach or security incident can significantly damage the user's reputation and customer trust.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The example code in the `README.md` directly presents hardcoded credentials without any warnings or alternative secure methods. While the documentation mentions other methods like environment variables and boto3 session configuration, the vulnerable example is still prominently featured.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Remove Hardcoded Credentials from Example Code**: The most critical mitigation is to remove the hardcoded AWS access key ID and secret access key from the example code in `README.md`. Replace them with placeholders or instructions to use secure credential management methods.
    - **Add Strong Warning Against Hardcoded Credentials**: Include a prominent warning in the `README.md` directly above or near the example code, explicitly stating the security risks of using hardcoded credentials in production environments.
    - **Recommend Secure Credential Management Methods**: In the `README.md`, clearly recommend and explain secure alternatives for managing AWS credentials, such as:
        - **Environment Variables**: Guide users on how to configure AWS credentials using environment variables.
        - **IAM Roles**: Explain how to leverage IAM roles for applications running on AWS infrastructure.
        - **AWS Secrets Manager**:  Suggest using AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing and retrieving credentials.
        - **Boto3 Default Credential Provider Chain**: Emphasize that `boto3` by default searches for credentials in a secure order, and users should rely on this chain instead of hardcoding credentials.
    - **Code Review and Static Analysis Recommendations**:  In the documentation, advise users to perform code reviews and use static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials before deploying their applications.
- Preconditions:
    - A user needs to copy the example code from the `README.md` file.
    - The user must fail to replace the example hardcoded AWS credentials with their own secure credentials or a secure credential management method.
    - The user must deploy the application containing the hardcoded credentials to a production or accessible environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
    - The `README.md` file contains example code blocks under the "Example Usage", "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session", and "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials" sections.
    - In each of these code blocks, the `boto3.Session` or `SigV4AuthProvider` is initialized with explicit `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `aws_session_token` parameters.
    - Example code snippet from "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session":
        ```python
        boto_session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                     aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                     aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                     region_name="us-east-2")
        ```
    - The values "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" and "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY" are clearly example access key ID and secret access key, but they are presented in a way that a user might mistakenly believe they are valid or can be used as is.
    - There are no warnings or disclaimers immediately surrounding these code examples to prevent users from misusing them in production.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create a Python virtual environment.
        - Install the `cassandra-sigv4` library: `pip install cassandra-sigv4`.
        - Install the `cassandra-driver`: `pip install cassandra-driver`.
        - Install `boto3`: `pip install boto3`.
        - Create a Python file, e.g., `test_hardcoded_creds.py`.
    2. **Vulnerable Code**:
        - Copy the "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session" example code from the `README.md` into `test_hardcoded_creds.py`.
        ```python
        from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
        from cassandra_sigv4.auth import SigV4AuthProvider
        from ssl import SSLContext, PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2, CERT_REQUIRED
        import boto3

        ssl_context = SSLContext(PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
        ssl_context.load_verify_locations('./AmazonRootCA1.pem') # You might need to download AmazonRootCA1.pem or comment out for test
        ssl_context.verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED
        boto_session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                     aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                     aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                     region_name="us-east-2")
        auth_provider = SigV4AuthProvider(boto_session)
        cluster = Cluster(['cassandra.us-east-2.amazonaws.com'], ssl_context=ssl_context, auth_provider=auth_provider,
                          port=9142)
        try:
            session = cluster.connect()
            print("Connection attempt initiated with hardcoded credentials.") # Indicate connection attempt
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Connection attempt with hardcoded credentials failed (expected in most cases): {e}") # Indicate connection failure

        ```
        - **Note**: You may need to download the `AmazonRootCA1.pem` certificate or comment out the SSL context lines for a basic test if you don't have a proper certificate setup. Also, connecting to `cassandra.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` with invalid credentials will likely fail, but the key is to show that the code *attempts* to use the hardcoded credentials for authentication.
    3. **Execution**:
        - Run the Python script: `python test_hardcoded_creds.py`.
    4. **Expected Outcome**:
        - The script will attempt to establish a connection to the Cassandra cluster using the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin and the hardcoded credentials provided in the example.
        - You will observe output indicating that a connection attempt was made using the hardcoded credentials. Even if the connection fails (due to invalid example credentials or network issues), the test demonstrates that the code indeed utilizes the hardcoded credentials for authentication, confirming the vulnerability.
        - If you were to replace the example credentials with valid AWS credentials for an Amazon Keyspaces instance, and have the necessary network and SSL setup, the script would successfully connect, further proving the vulnerability if these credentials were unintentionally left hardcoded.
