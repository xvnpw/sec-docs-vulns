### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Example Usage
- Description:
    - The `README.md` file provides example code snippets demonstrating how to use the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin.
    - These examples include hardcoded AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token for demonstration purposes.
    - Developers, especially those new to AWS or quickly implementing the plugin, might copy and paste these examples directly into their application code.
    - They might unintentionally use these hardcoded example credentials or, worse, replace the placeholders with their *actual* AWS credentials directly in the code.
    - This results in hardcoded AWS credentials within their applications.
- Impact:
    - If AWS credentials are hardcoded and exposed (e.g., through public code repositories, logs, or configuration files), unauthorized users could gain access to the associated AWS account and resources, specifically Amazon Keyspaces instances.
    - This unauthorized access can lead to:
        - Data breaches: Sensitive data stored in Amazon Keyspaces could be accessed and stolen.
        - Data manipulation: Data within Amazon Keyspaces could be modified or deleted.
        - Resource hijacking:  Amazon Keyspaces resources could be used for malicious purposes.
        - Financial losses:  Unauthorized usage of Amazon Keyspaces resources can lead to unexpected AWS charges.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code and documentation examples directly show hardcoded credentials without sufficient warnings against this practice.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit Warning in README:** Add a prominent warning in the README.md, especially within and around the example usage sections. This warning should strongly advise against hardcoding AWS credentials in production environments. It should clearly recommend secure credential management practices.
    - **Best Practices Documentation:** Include a dedicated section in the documentation detailing secure credential management best practices for AWS when using this plugin. This section should link to official AWS documentation on credential security (e.g., IAM roles, environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Credentials Provider Chain).
- Preconditions:
    - A developer uses the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin to connect to Amazon Keyspaces.
    - The developer refers to the example code provided in the `README.md` file for guidance.
    - The developer copies the example code and either uses the hardcoded example credentials or replaces them with their actual AWS credentials directly in their application code.
    - The application code with hardcoded credentials is deployed or shared in a way that makes the credentials accessible to unauthorized parties (e.g., committed to a public repository, stored in publicly accessible logs, or left in configuration files within a publicly accessible system).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/README.md`**:
        - The `README.md` file contains multiple code examples in the "Example Usage", "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session", and "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials" sections.
        - These examples are intended to demonstrate how to initialize and use the `SigV4AuthProvider`.
        - **Vulnerability Point:**  Critically, these examples directly embed hardcoded AWS credentials as strings within the code:
            ```python
            boto_session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                         aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                         aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                         region_name="us-east-2")
            ```
            and
            ```python
            auth_provider = SigV4AuthProvider(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                              aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                              aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                              region_name="us-east-2")
            ```
        - **Missing Mitigation:** The `README.md` lacks any prominent warning or cautionary advice directly adjacent to these code examples about the severe security risks of hardcoding credentials, especially in production environments. While the documentation does mention other configuration methods (Environment Variable, Boto3 Session Configuration), it does not explicitly discourage hardcoding in the example context itself.
    - **File: `/code/cassandra_sigv4/auth.py`**:
        - The `SigV4AuthProvider` class constructor in `auth.py` (File: `/code/cassandra_sigv4/auth.py`) is designed to accept AWS credentials directly as parameters: `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `aws_session_token`.
        - While this design is necessary for certain use cases where programmatic credential provision is required, it directly supports and enables the insecure practice of hardcoding credentials if developers choose to use these parameters with literal string values, especially when following the `README.md` examples.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume an attacker has access to the project's `README.md` file (publicly available on GitHub).
        - A developer, "VulnerableDev", intends to use the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin in their application to connect to Amazon Keyspaces.
        - VulnerableDev refers to the `README.md` for example usage and, without fully understanding the security implications, copies the example code directly.
        - VulnerableDev naively replaces the example placeholder credentials in the code with their *actual* AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for their AWS account, directly embedding them as strings in their application code.
        - VulnerableDev then commits this application code, including the hardcoded AWS credentials, to a public Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) for version control and collaboration.
    2. **Attack:**
        - The attacker discovers VulnerableDev's public Git repository (e.g., through searching for keywords related to Amazon Keyspaces or the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin on GitHub).
        - The attacker browses the repository's code and identifies the file where VulnerableDev implemented the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin, finding the hardcoded AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key within the code.
        - The attacker copies the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
        - The attacker configures the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on their local machine using the stolen credentials: `aws configure`.
        - The attacker uses the AWS CLI to attempt to access VulnerableDev's Amazon Keyspaces resources. For example, the attacker can list keyspaces in the assumed region: `aws keyspaces list-keyspaces --region <VulnerableDev's Keyspaces region>`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:**
        - If VulnerableDev has indeed hardcoded valid, active AWS credentials, the attacker will successfully authenticate to VulnerableDev's AWS account using the stolen credentials.
        - The attacker will be able to list keyspaces and potentially perform other actions on VulnerableDev's Amazon Keyspaces instance, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised AWS credentials. This demonstrates successful unauthorized access due to hardcoded credentials.
        - **Note:** While the example credentials ("AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE", "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY") provided in the `README.md` are invalid and would not grant access, this test case illustrates the *process* by which an attacker can exploit hardcoded credentials if a developer mistakenly uses their *real* credentials in the same way as shown in the example. The vulnerability lies in the example's presentation and the lack of sufficient warning, which increases the likelihood of developers making this critical security mistake.
