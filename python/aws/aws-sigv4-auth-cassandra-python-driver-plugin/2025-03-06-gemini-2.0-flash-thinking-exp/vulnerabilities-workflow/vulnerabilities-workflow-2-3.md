### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Example Code

- Description:
    1. The `README.md` file contains example code snippets demonstrating how to use the `cassandra-sigv4` plugin.
    2. These examples include hardcoded AWS access key ID (`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`), secret access key (`wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`), and session token (`AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>`).
    3. A user, especially one new to AWS or this plugin, might copy and paste these example code snippets directly into their application for testing or initial setup.
    4. If the user fails to replace these hardcoded example credentials with their own valid AWS credentials before deploying or using the application in a real environment, the application will be using publicly known or easily guessable credentials.
    5. An attacker who becomes aware of these hardcoded credentials could potentially use them to access the user's Amazon Keyspaces instance, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

- Impact:
    High. If a user inadvertently uses the hardcoded credentials in a live environment, it can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to Amazon Keyspaces.
    - Data breaches, including reading, modifying, or deleting data within the Keyspaces.
    - Potential escalation of privileges if the hardcoded credentials have broader permissions than intended for example usage.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The code itself does not contain any mitigations for this documentation-related vulnerability. The example credentials include the string "EXAMPLE", which is a weak attempt at indicating they are placeholders, but it is insufficient as users might overlook this or not understand the security implications.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove the hardcoded AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token from all example code blocks in `README.md`.
    - Replace the hardcoded credentials with clear placeholder values that are obviously not valid credentials and cannot be misinterpreted as such. For example, use placeholders like `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`, `<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`, and `<YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>`.
    - Add a prominent warning section in the "Example Usage" and "Programmatically Configure the Driver" sections of the `README.md`. This warning should explicitly state:
        - That the provided credentials are for example purposes only and are not valid for accessing real AWS resources.
        - The severe security risks associated with using hardcoded credentials.
        - Instructions on how to obtain and securely manage their own AWS credentials (e.g., using IAM roles, environment variables, AWS configuration files, or boto3 session profiles).

- Preconditions:
    - A user needs to access the `README.md` file and copy the example code snippets.
    - The user must fail to recognize the hardcoded credentials as placeholders or not understand the security risk of using them.
    - The user must deploy or run the application with the copied example code in an environment where it can attempt to connect to Amazon Keyspaces.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
    - Sections:
        - "Example Usage"
        - "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session"
        - "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials"
    - Code snippets within these sections contain the following hardcoded credentials:
        ```python
        boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                             aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                             aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                             region_name="us-east-2")
        ```
        ```python
        SigV4AuthProvider(aws_access_key_id="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                                  aws_secret_access_key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
                                  aws_session_token="AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of token>",
                                  region_name="us-east-2")
        ```
    - These hardcoded strings are directly embedded in the example code, making them easily accessible to anyone reading the documentation and posing a risk if users 그대로 copy and paste them into their applications without proper credential management.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: No specific setup is needed for this test as it focuses on reviewing the content of the `README.md` file.
    2. Procedure:
        a. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor or web browser.
        b. Navigate to the "Example Usage" section.
        c. Examine the Python code block provided under "Programmatically Configure the Driver With a boto3 session".
        d. Identify the lines where `boto3.Session` is initialized and check the values assigned to `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `aws_session_token`.
        e. Verify that these parameters are set to the hardcoded values: `"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"`, `"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"`, and a placeholder session token, respectively.
        f. Repeat steps c-e for the code block under "Programmatically Configure the Drive with raw AWS Credentials", checking the `SigV4AuthProvider` initialization.
    3. Expected Result: The test should confirm the presence of hardcoded AWS credentials (`"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"` and `"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"`) within the example code blocks in the `README.md` file.
    4. Actual Result: Upon inspection, the `README.md` file indeed contains the hardcoded AWS credentials as expected.
    5. Conclusion: The security test case successfully demonstrates the vulnerability. The `README.md` file includes hardcoded AWS credentials in its example code, which is a security risk due to potential user misconfiguration and credential exposure.
