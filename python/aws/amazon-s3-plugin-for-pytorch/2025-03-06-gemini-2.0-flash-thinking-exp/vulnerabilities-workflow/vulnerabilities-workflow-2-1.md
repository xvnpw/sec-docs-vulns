- Vulnerability Name: S3 URL Path Traversal in `list_files` and Dataset Classes
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious S3 URL containing path traversal sequences such as `..` or URL-encoded representations like `%2e%2e`. For example: `s3://victim-bucket/normal_path/../sensitive_data/`.
    2. A victim uses this malicious URL with the S3 plugin, either directly in functions like `list_files()` or indirectly by passing it to dataset classes like `S3Dataset` or `S3IterableDataset`.
    3. If the S3 URL parsing logic within the plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the URL path, the path traversal sequences are passed to the AWS S3 API.
    4. The S3 API processes these path traversal sequences, potentially allowing the plugin to access or list files outside the intended S3 bucket path.
    5. This can lead to information disclosure, where an attacker could discover the existence and names of files or folders in parent directories or other sensitive locations within the victim's S3 bucket, based on the permissions associated with the victim's AWS credentials.
- Impact: Information Disclosure. An attacker can potentially list files and directories in S3 buckets outside the intended path, revealing sensitive information about bucket structure and file names.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None identified in the provided code. The code does not appear to have any explicit input validation or sanitization for S3 URLs to prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust S3 URL parsing and validation in the C++ backend to sanitize URL paths and prevent path traversal sequences.
    - Before making any S3 API calls (like `ListObjectsV2` or `GetObject`), the plugin should validate and normalize the object key or prefix to remove or neutralize path traversal elements.
    - Consider using a dedicated URL parsing library in C++ that provides built-in path normalization and sanitization functionalities.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim must use a maliciously crafted S3 URL, either directly or indirectly through an application using this plugin.
    - The AWS credentials used by the victim's application or environment must have sufficient permissions to access and list objects in the targeted S3 bucket and potentially parent directories if path traversal is successful.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided code files do not contain the core C++ implementation where S3 URL parsing and interaction with AWS S3 API happens. However, based on the Python test files (`test_utils.py`, `test_s3dataset.py`, `test_s3iterabledataset.py`, `test_regions.py`) and the general usage patterns described in `README.md` and example Python scripts, the plugin takes S3 URLs as input to functions like `list_files()`, and dataset classes constructors (`S3Dataset`, `S3IterableDataset`).
    - The vulnerability likely resides in the C++ backend (`aws_io` extension module, built by CMake as seen in `setup.py`). A hypothetical vulnerable code snippet in C++ could look like this (illustrative):

    ```c++
    #include <aws/s3/S3Client.h>
    #include <aws/s3/model/ListObjectsV2Request.h>
    #include <aws/core/Aws.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    #include <string>

    std::vector<std::string> list_s3_objects(const std::string& s3_url) {
        Aws::SDKOptions options;
        Aws::InitAPI(options);
        {
            Aws::S3::S3Client s3_client;
            std::string bucket_name;
            std::string object_prefix;

            // Hypothetically vulnerable parsing: splitting URL by '/' without sanitization
            size_t prefix_start = s3_url.find("s3://");
            if (prefix_start != 0) return {};
            std::string path_part = s3_url.substr(5);
            size_t bucket_end = path_part.find('/');
            if (bucket_end == std::string::npos) return {};
            bucket_name = path_part.substr(0, bucket_end);
            object_prefix = path_part.substr(bucket_end + 1);

            Aws::S3::Model::ListObjectsV2Request list_request;
            list_request.WithBucket(bucket_name.c_str()).WithPrefix(object_prefix.c_str()); // Potentially vulnerable prefix

            Aws::S3::Model::ListObjectsV2Outcome outcome = s3_client.ListObjectsV2(list_request);
            std::vector<std::string> keys;
            if (outcome.IsSuccess()) {
                for (const auto& object : outcome.GetResult().GetContents()) {
                    keys.push_back(object.GetKey().c_str());
                }
            } else {
                std::cerr << "Error listing objects in S3: " << outcome.GetError().GetMessage() << std::endl;
            }
            Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);
            return keys;
        }
    }
    ```
    - In this hypothetical code, the `object_prefix` derived from the S3 URL is directly used in the `ListObjectsV2Request` without any validation. If the `s3_url` contains path traversal sequences like `..`, the S3 API will interpret them, potentially leading to listing of objects outside the intended prefix.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - You need access to an AWS account and the ability to create an S3 bucket. Let's name it `test-bucket-awsio-vuln`.
        - Inside `test-bucket-awsio-vuln`, create two folders: `normal-folder` and `sensitive-folder`.
        - In `normal-folder`, create a file named `file_in_normal.txt`.
        - In `sensitive-folder`, create a file named `secret_file.txt`.
        - Ensure that the AWS credentials configured for running the test have `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` permissions on `test-bucket-awsio-vuln`.
    2. **Malicious URL Crafting:**
        - Construct a malicious S3 URL that uses path traversal to try and list the contents of `sensitive-folder` when intending to access `normal-folder`. The malicious URL would be: `s3://test-bucket-awsio-vuln/normal-folder/../sensitive-folder`.
    3. **Execution of Test:**
        - Use the `list_files()` function from the `awsio.python.lib.io.s3.s3dataset` module with the crafted malicious URL in a Python script:

        ```python
        from awsio.python.lib.io.s3.s3dataset import list_files

        malicious_url = 's3://test-bucket-awsio-vuln/normal-folder/../sensitive-folder' # Replace with your bucket name

        try:
            files_listed = list_files(malicious_url)
            print("Files listed:", files_listed)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error:", e)
        ```
        - **Note:** Replace `test-bucket-awsio-vuln` with the actual name of the bucket you created.
    4. **Expected Vulnerable Outcome:**
        - If the path traversal vulnerability exists, the `list_files()` function, when called with the malicious URL `s3://test-bucket-awsio-vuln/normal-folder/../sensitive-folder`, will likely return a list of files or folders within the `sensitive-folder`. This would indicate that the `..` sequence was processed, allowing access outside the intended `normal-folder` path. The output `files_listed` would contain entries related to `sensitive-folder`, possibly including `s3://test-bucket-awsio-vuln/sensitive-folder/secret_file.txt`.
    5. **Expected Secure Outcome:**
        - If path traversal is correctly mitigated, `list_files()` should not list the contents of `sensitive-folder`. Ideally, it should either:
            - Return an empty list, indicating no files found at the resolved path (if `..` is effectively neutralized).
            - Raise an error, indicating an invalid path or path traversal attempt is detected.
            - List files within a directory named literally `..` inside `normal-folder/sensitive_folder` (which is highly unlikely to exist in the setup).
        - In a secure scenario, the output `files_listed` should NOT contain any files from `sensitive-folder`.
    6. **Verification:**
        - Examine the output of the Python script. If `files_listed` contains entries that are within `sensitive-folder` (like `s3://test-bucket-awsio-vuln/sensitive-folder/secret_file.txt`), the path traversal vulnerability is confirmed. If the list is empty or contains files only from within or logically related to `normal-folder` (and not `sensitive-folder`), then path traversal is likely being mitigated.
