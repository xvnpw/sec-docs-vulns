### Vulnerability Name: Local File Inclusion in `add-raw-model` command

Description:
An attacker can exploit a local file inclusion vulnerability in the `add-raw-model` command by providing a malicious file path to the `--model-local-path` option. If the `panorama-cli` tool does not properly sanitize this input, it could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the developer's local filesystem. This is because the tool might process or include the file specified by the attacker without proper validation, potentially revealing sensitive information.

Impact:
An attacker could read sensitive files from the developer's machine, such as configuration files, private keys, source code, or any other file that the user running `panorama-cli` has access to. This information could be used for further attacks, such as gaining unauthorized access to AWS accounts or internal systems, or to compromise the developer's environment and intellectual property.

Vulnerability Rank: High

Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. Based on the provided documentation, there is no mention of input sanitization or security measures to prevent local file inclusion for the `--model-local-path` option in the `add-raw-model` command.  Without access to the source code, it is assumed that no specific mitigations are implemented within the tool itself regarding path sanitization for local file paths.

Missing Mitigations:
Input sanitization and path validation are missing for the `--model-local-path` option in the `add-raw-model` command.
- Implement path validation to ensure that the provided path is restricted to the intended directories, such as the project's asset directory or a designated safe location for model files.
- Sanitize the input path to prevent path traversal attacks by blocking characters like `..` and ensuring that the path is treated as a filename within the allowed directory and not as an arbitrary system path.
- Employ secure file handling practices to avoid directly using user-provided paths in file operations without validation.

Preconditions:
- The attacker needs to convince a developer to use the `aws-panorama-cli` tool.
- The developer must execute the `add-raw-model` command with the `--model-local-path` option and provide a malicious file path.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the file path on the developer's local filesystem that they want to access.

Source Code Analysis:
Unfortunately, the provided project files do not include the Python source code where the command-line interface logic and the `add-raw-model` command are implemented. Therefore, a detailed step-by-step source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code section is not possible with the given information. To perform a complete source code analysis, access to the `panoramacli` Python package's source code, specifically the implementation of the `add-raw-model` command and how it handles the `--model-local-path` option, is required.

Assuming a hypothetical scenario where the `add_raw_model` function directly uses the `--model-local-path` value in file operations without validation, the vulnerability can be triggered as follows:
1. The `add_raw_model` command is invoked with the `--model-local-path` argument.
2. The value provided to `--model-local-path` is intended to be the path to a local model file.
3. If the code directly uses this path in file operations (e.g., copying the file to the project's assets directory) without checking if the path is valid and safe, it becomes vulnerable to LFI.
4. An attacker can provide a path to a sensitive file outside the intended project directory, such as `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows, as the `--model-local-path`.
5. The tool, without proper sanitization, will attempt to access and potentially copy or process the file specified by the attacker.
6. This allows the attacker to read the content of arbitrary files on the developer's system that the user running the tool has permissions to access.

Security Test Case:
1. Initialize a new Panorama project using the CLI:
   ```shell
   panorama-cli init-project --name test_lfi_project
   cd test_lfi_project
   ```
2. Create a dummy descriptor file (e.g., `test_descriptor.json`) with basic content required for the `add-raw-model` command:
   ```shell
   echo '{"mlModelDescriptor": {"envelopeVersion": "2021-01-01"}}' > test_descriptor.json
   ```
3. Attempt to add a raw model using the `add-raw-model` command, providing the path to a sensitive system file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `/etc/hosts` on macOS) as the `--model-local-path`:
   ```shell
   panorama-cli add-raw-model --model-asset-name sensitive_file_content --model-local-path /etc/passwd --descriptor-path test_descriptor.json --packages-path packages/accountXYZ-call_node-1.0
   ```
   Note: You might need to create the directory `packages/accountXYZ-call_node-1.0` if it doesn't exist, or adjust the `--packages-path` to an existing package directory in your test project.
4. Examine the output of the command for any errors. If the command completes successfully without indicating a security issue, proceed to the next step.
5. Check the project's asset directory (typically `test_lfi_project/assets` or within a package's `assets` subdirectory, depending on the tool's implementation and `--packages-path` argument). Look for a file related to the `--model-asset-name` provided (e.g., `sensitive_file_content.tar.gz` or similar).
6. Inspect the contents of the created asset file. If the asset file contains the content of the sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), it confirms the Local File Inclusion vulnerability. You can extract the archive if it's a compressed format or directly read the file if it's plain text to verify its content.

If this test case successfully includes the content of `/etc/passwd` (or another sensitive file) into the project's assets, it demonstrates a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the `add-raw-model` command due to insufficient path sanitization of the `--model-local-path` input.
