- Vulnerability Name: Privileged Docker Image User
  - Description:
    - The project offers "privileged" Docker images designed for local experimentation and debugging.
    - These images are configured to run as the `root` user within the Docker container.
    - If a user were to deploy a "privileged" image in a non-development environment and expose the Airflow webserver, any exploitable code execution vulnerabilities in Airflow would then run with root privileges inside the container.
    - Step-by-step to trigger vulnerability:
      1. User builds a "privileged" Docker image (e.g., `amazon-mwaa-docker-images/airflow:2.9.2-explorer-privileged-dev`).
      2. User runs the privileged Docker image and exposes the Airflow webserver to the network.
      3. Attacker identifies and exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the version of Apache Airflow running within the Docker image.
      4. The exploit executes arbitrary code within the Airflow container environment with root privileges.
  - Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of an Airflow RCE vulnerability in a "privileged" Docker image allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the `root` user within the container.
    - This can lead to:
      - Full compromise of the Docker container.
      - Unauthorized access to and modification of any files within the container.
      - Installation of malicious software within the container.
      - Potential container escape and compromise of the host system, depending on Docker runtime configuration and vulnerabilities.
      - Exfiltration of sensitive data accessible within the container's environment.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Documentation Warning: The README.md explicitly documents the "privileged" image type, stating it "run as the `root` user instead" and is "useful if the user wants to do some experiments as the root user". This serves as a documented warning against using these images in production-like scenarios.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Stronger warnings in documentation: Enhance the README.md to more explicitly warn against deploying "privileged" images in non-development environments due to the escalated security risks.
    - Discouragement of privileged images:  Clearly discourage the use of "privileged" images except for specific local experimentation and debugging purposes.
    - Consider removing privileged images: Evaluate the necessity of providing "privileged" images and consider removing them to eliminate the risk of accidental or intentional misuse in production-like environments.
  - Preconditions:
    - User builds and deploys a "privileged" Docker image.
    - The Airflow webserver within the Docker container is exposed and accessible to potential attackers.
    - A known and exploitable Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the specific version of Apache Airflow deployed within the Docker image.
  - Source code analysis:
    - README.md: Documents the existence and purpose of "privileged" images, highlighting root user execution for experimentation.
    - `/code/images/airflow/2.10.1/build.sh` (and similar `build.sh` files for other Airflow versions): Scripts that build the Docker images iterate through build types, including "explorer-privileged", and construct Dockerfile names and tags accordingly.
    - Dockerfile templates (`/code/images/airflow/2.10.1/Dockerfiles/Dockerfile-explorer-privileged-dev` and similar): These Dockerfiles, generated from `Dockerfile.derivatives.j2`, conditionally set `USER root` based on the `build_type` being "explorer-privileged".
  - Security test case:
    1. Build a "privileged" Docker image (e.g., `amazon-mwaa-docker-images/airflow:2.9.2-explorer-privileged-dev`) using the provided `run.sh` script for the specific Airflow version.
    2. Run the built "privileged" Docker image, ensuring that port 8080 (the default Airflow webserver port) is exposed and accessible from outside the Docker host.
    3. Identify a known and publicly documented Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that affects the specific version of Apache Airflow (e.g., Airflow 2.9.2 or the version being tested). For example, research CVE databases for known RCE vulnerabilities in that Airflow version.
    4. Develop or obtain a working exploit that leverages the identified RCE vulnerability. This exploit should be designed to execute a command within the container that clearly demonstrates root privileges (e.g., a command that creates a file in the `/root` directory, which is typically only writable by the root user).
    5. Send the crafted exploit request to the exposed Airflow webserver endpoint. The exact method will depend on the specifics of the chosen Airflow RCE vulnerability (e.g., sending a malicious DAG file, crafting a specific HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint).
    6. After sending the exploit, access a shell within the running Docker container (e.g., using `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`).
    7. Within the container shell, verify the successful execution of the exploit by checking for the expected outcome of the command (e.g., check if the file in `/root` was created, confirming root-level code execution).
