### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Origin Control Policy Modification via Malicious Manifest
- Description:
  1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS credentials configured for the toolkit. This could be achieved through various means such as credential leakage, compromised EC2 instances, or insider threat.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious CSV manifest file. This file is designed to be used as input for the `apply_package_configurations.py` script. The manifest contains modified origin control configurations that weaken the security of the AWS CodeArtifact repository. For instance, the attacker could change the `upstream` policy from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW` for critical internal packages, or change `publish` policy from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW` for packages intended to be protected from external contributions.
  3. The attacker executes the `apply_package_configurations.py` script, providing the crafted malicious manifest file as input using the `--input` parameter.
  4. The script, using the compromised AWS credentials, processes the malicious manifest. For each package entry in the manifest, it calls the AWS CodeArtifact `PutPackageOriginConfiguration` API to update the origin control policy according to the attacker's specifications.
  5. As a result, the origin control policies in the AWS CodeArtifact repository are weakened. This allows for dependency confusion attacks because the repository now might be configured to accept package versions from unintended, potentially malicious, upstream sources.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to weaken the origin control policies of an AWS CodeArtifact repository.
  - This weakened state makes the repository vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks.
  - Attackers can potentially inject malicious packages into the software supply chain by exploiting the relaxed origin control policies.
  - This could lead to compromised builds, deployment of vulnerable applications, and potential data breaches or system compromise in downstream systems that rely on packages from the affected repository.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The toolkit itself provides a `--ask-confirmation` flag in `apply_package_configurations.py`. If used, this flag requires manual confirmation for each origin control policy change, which could potentially alert administrators to unexpected modifications if they are reviewing each change carefully. However, this is not a default setting and relies on vigilant administrators.
  - Backup and restore functionality is implemented in `apply_package_configurations.py`. This allows for reverting to a previous configuration if malicious changes are detected, provided backups were enabled and not compromised.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  The AWS credentials used by the toolkit should have the minimum necessary permissions. Ideally, the credentials should be scoped down to only the specific CodeArtifact repositories and actions required, and not broader AWS account access.
  - **Credential Management Best Practices**: Emphasize secure storage and management of AWS credentials. Avoid storing credentials directly in scripts or configuration files. Encourage the use of IAM roles for EC2 instances or container environments, and AWS Secrets Manager or similar services for other deployment scenarios.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: While the `apply_package_configurations.py` script does validate the input CSV file for format and required fields, it does not perform any validation on the *content* of the origin control policies themselves to ensure they align with security best practices or organizational policies. Implementing checks to prevent overly permissive policies (e.g., alerting or blocking if upstream is set to ALLOW when it should be BLOCK for internal packages) could enhance security.
  - **Audit Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging of all actions performed by the toolkit, especially changes to origin control policies. Monitor these logs for suspicious activities or unauthorized modifications. Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for real-time alerting.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for the AWS accounts and IAM users that are authorized to run the toolkit. This adds an extra layer of security to protect against credential compromise.
- Preconditions:
  - **Compromised AWS Credentials**: The attacker must gain access to valid AWS credentials that are authorized to execute the `apply_package_configurations.py` script and modify origin control policies in the target AWS CodeArtifact domain and repository.
  - **Target Repository Access**: The compromised credentials must have sufficient permissions to modify the origin control policies of the target AWS CodeArtifact repository.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - **`apply_package_configurations.py`**:
    ```python
    def run_individual_task(codeartifact_client, task, backup_manager):
        task_id, reader, done_callback, error_callback = task
        res = None
        try:
            if args.ask_confirmation and not get_user_confirmation():
                return task_id, res, False
            if backup_manager:
                backup_manager.do_backup(reader(task_id), codeartifact_client.get_restrictions(**reader(task_id)))
            if not args.dry_run:
                res = codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions(**reader(task_id)) # Vulnerable line
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"error! {e}")
            error_callback(task_id)
            return task_id, res, False

        done_callback(task_id)
        return task_id, res, True
    ```
    - The `run_individual_task` function in `apply_package_configurations.py` is responsible for applying the origin control configurations.
    - It retrieves task data, including the desired origin control settings, from the `WorkspaceManager`.
    - It calls `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions(**reader(task_id))` to apply the configurations to AWS CodeArtifact. The `reader(task_id)` function (from `WorkspaceManager`) reads the configuration directly from the input file (or workspace files derived from it).
    - If an attacker can modify the input CSV file that `WorkspaceManager` processes, they can control the values passed to `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions`, thus manipulating the origin control policies.
  - **`toolkit/workspace.py`**:
    - `WorkspaceManager` is responsible for parsing the input CSV and creating individual task files.
    - It reads data directly from the input CSV file in `create_input_files()` and stores it in workspace files.
    - This design means that whatever is in the input CSV directly influences the actions performed by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
  - **`toolkit/codeartifact_client.py`**:
    - `CodeArtifactClient.apply_restrictions` directly calls the `put_package_origin_configuration` API of AWS CodeArtifact using the parameters provided. There is no additional validation or security check within this client method beyond what AWS CodeArtifact API itself enforces.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites**:
     - You need AWS credentials configured that have permissions to:
       - Read and write origin control policies for a CodeArtifact repository.
       - List packages in the repository.
     - You need an existing AWS CodeArtifact domain and repository to test against.
     - Install the toolkit as described in the `README.md`.
  2. **Setup**:
     - Assume you have an input CSV file (e.g., `initial_config.csv`) that represents the current, secure origin control policy settings for your repository. Create this file or use the output of `generate_package_configurations.py`.
     - Apply this initial configuration using `apply_package_configurations.py` to set a baseline.
  3. **Craft Malicious Manifest**:
     - Create a new CSV file (e.g., `malicious_config.csv`) based on `initial_config.csv`.
     - In `malicious_config.csv`, modify the `upstream` value from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW` for a critical internal package you want to test (e.g., `internal-package-1`). Ensure other fields like `domain`, `repository`, `format`, `namespace`, `package` remain correct for the target package.
  4. **Execute `apply_package_configurations.py` with Malicious Manifest**:
     ```bash
     python apply_package_configurations.py --region <your-region> --domain <your-domain> --repository <your-repository> --input malicious_config.csv
     ```
     Replace `<your-region>`, `<your-domain>`, and `<your-repository>` with your actual AWS details.
     **Do not use `--dry-run`**.
  5. **Verify Policy Change in AWS Console or via AWS CLI**:
     - Go to the AWS CodeArtifact console for your domain and repository.
     - Find the package `internal-package-1`.
     - Check its origin control policy. Verify that the `upstream` policy is now set to `ALLOW`, as specified in your `malicious_config.csv`.
     - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to describe the package and verify the `upstream` restriction:
       ```bash
       aws codeartifact describe-package --domain <your-domain> --repository <your-repository> --format <package-format> --package internal-package-1 --package <package-name> --region <your-region>
       ```
  6. **Expected Result**:
     - If the test is successful, you should observe that the origin control policy for `internal-package-1` has been changed to `upstream=ALLOW`, demonstrating that a malicious manifest can indeed weaken the security configuration when processed by `apply_package_configurations.py` with valid AWS credentials.

This vulnerability highlights the risk of insecure application configuration when using powerful tools like this toolkit, especially when AWS credentials are not properly secured. While the tool itself is designed for bulk policy management, unauthorized use can have significant security implications.
