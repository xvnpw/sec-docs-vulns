### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Input Validation in CSV File Leads to Origin Control Weakening
  - Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to AWS credentials with sufficient permissions to execute `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious CSV input file, or modifies an existing one, to weaken origin control policies. For example, the attacker can change the `upstream` and `publish` flags in the CSV file to `ALLOW` for specific packages that should have stricter controls (e.g., internal packages that should have `upstream=BLOCK`).
    3. The attacker executes `apply_package_configurations.py` using the modified CSV file as input, targeting the victim's CodeArtifact repository.
    4. The `validate_file()` function in `apply_package_configurations.py` performs basic checks on the CSV format and field values, but it **does not validate the semantic correctness or security implications of the configurations**. Specifically, it does not verify if the package names, namespaces, or the combination of `upstream` and `publish` flags are intended or secure.
    5. The `apply_package_configurations.py` script processes the malicious CSV and calls the CodeArtifact API to update the origin control configurations according to the attacker's modified settings.
    6. The origin control policies for the targeted packages are weakened, potentially re-enabling upstream access for internal packages. This increases the risk of dependency confusion attacks, as malicious external packages with the same name can now be installed from upstream sources if they become available there.
  - Impact: Weakened origin control policies. An attacker can maliciously reconfigure package origin controls, specifically by re-enabling upstream access and/or package publishing for packages that should be restricted. This increases the risk of dependency confusion attacks, where internal projects might inadvertently download and use malicious packages from public repositories if an attacker manages to publish a package with the same name to a public repository.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Basic CSV format validation in `validate_file()` function, which checks for header presence, required fields, and valid values for `upstream` and `publish` flags.
    - User confirmation prompt via `--ask-confirmation` flag, which requires manual approval before applying changes. However, this relies on the administrator correctly reviewing the changes, which might be difficult for large CSV files and complex configurations.
    - Backup of existing origin control configurations via `BackupManager` (unless `--no-backup` flag is used), allowing for potential rollback to a previous state.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Semantic validation of the CSV content against expected or allowed configurations. This could include:
      - Validating package names and namespaces against a whitelist or expected patterns.
      - Enforcing policies on allowed combinations of `upstream` and `publish` flags for specific packages or namespaces.
    - Input integrity verification, such as digital signing or checksumming of the CSV file, to ensure it has not been tampered with after generation.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and principle of least privilege for AWS credentials used to run the script. While not directly mitigating the input validation vulnerability, restricting permissions can limit the impact of compromised credentials.
  - Preconditions:
    - Attacker has obtained valid AWS credentials with sufficient permissions to execute `apply_package_configurations.py` and modify CodeArtifact origin control configurations (specifically, `codeartifact:PutPackageOriginConfiguration`).
    - Attacker has the ability to modify the CSV input file that will be used by `apply_package_configurations.py` before it is processed. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising the system where the CSV file is stored, gaining access to a shared file system, or through social engineering.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Input Processing and Validation (`apply_package_configurations.py`):**
       - The script starts by parsing command-line arguments using `parse_args()`, including the `--input` argument which specifies the CSV file path.
       - The `validate_file()` function is called to perform initial validation on the input CSV file. Let's examine `validate_file()`:
         ```python
         def validate_file():
             with open(args.input, "r") as f:
                 reader = csv.DictReader(f)
                 validate_header(f, reader)
                 for line in reader:
                     validate_line(line, reader.line_num)
             print('File is valid and contains {} lines'.format(reader.line_num))
             return reader.line_num

         def validate_header(f, reader):
             # Verify the header is present
             sniffer = csv.Sniffer()
             has_header = sniffer.has_header(f.read(2048))
             if not has_header:
                 raise Exception("No header detected!")
             f.seek(0)
             # Verify that it has all necessary fields
             if Counter(reader.fieldnames) != Counter(CSV_HEADER):
                 raise Exception("Check your header, some fields are missing!")

         def validate_line(line, line_number):
             if line['domain'] != args.domain:
                 raise Exception('[{}] Domain {} is different from expected value of {}'
                                 .format(line_number, line['domain'], args.domain))
             if line['repository'] != args.repository:
                 raise Exception('[{}] Repository {} is different from expected value of {}'
                                 .format(line_number, line['repository'], args.repository))
             if line['upstream'] not in ALLOWED_FLAG_VALUES:
                 raise Exception('[{}] \"upstream\" must be either ALLOW or BLOCK, cannot be {}'
                                 .format(line_number, line['upstream']))
             if line['publish'] not in ALLOWED_FLAG_VALUES:
                 raise Exception('[{}] \"publish\" must be either ALLOW or BLOCK, cannot be {}'
                                 .format(line_number, line['upstream']))
         ```
         - `validate_file()` checks for CSV header, required fields (`CSV_HEADER`), and validates that `domain`, `repository`, `upstream`, and `publish` fields are present and have allowed values (`ALLOW` or `BLOCK`).
         - **Crucially, it does NOT validate the package names, namespaces, or the combination of configurations**. An attacker can modify the CSV to include any package name and namespace and set `upstream` and `publish` to `ALLOW` without triggering any validation errors.

    2. **Task Execution (`apply_package_configurations.py` and `run_individual_task()`):**
       - The `dispatch_work()` function reads tasks from the workspace and uses `thread_map` to process them in parallel using `dispatch_task()`.
       - `dispatch_task()` calls `run_individual_task()`.
       - `run_individual_task()`:
         ```python
         def run_individual_task(codeartifact_client, task, backup_manager):
             task_id, reader, done_callback, error_callback = task
             res = None
             try:
                 if args.ask_confirmation and not get_user_confirmation():
                     return task_id, res, False
                 if backup_manager:
                     backup_manager.do_backup(reader(task_id), codeartifact_client.get_restrictions(**reader(task_id)))
                 if not args.dry_run:
                     res = codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions(**reader(task_id))
             except Exception as e:
                 print(f"error! {e}")
                 error_callback(task_id)
                 return task_id, res, False

             done_callback(task_id)
             return task_id, res, True
         ```
         - This function reads task data using `reader(task_id)` (which retrieves data from workspace files created from the CSV), optionally performs backup, and then calls `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions()` to apply the configurations from the CSV line to CodeArtifact.
         - `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions()` directly calls the `put_package_origin_configuration` API without further validation of the input data beyond what is performed by the AWS SDK itself (which is primarily API parameter validation, not semantic security validation).

    ```

    **Conclusion:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of semantic validation of the input CSV file. The script trusts the CSV content after basic format checks and applies the configurations directly to CodeArtifact, allowing an attacker to weaken origin control policies by crafting a malicious CSV.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
       - You need an AWS account with CodeArtifact domain and repository set up.
       - You have AWS credentials configured that have permissions to:
         - Execute `apply_package_configurations.py`.
         - Read and write CodeArtifact origin configurations (`codeartifact:PutPackageOriginConfiguration`, `codeartifact:DescribePackage`).
       - You have the `aws-codeartifact-package-origin-control-toolkit` project code downloaded and installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    2. **Setup:**
       - Identify an existing package in your CodeArtifact repository for testing. Let's assume a package named `internal-package` in `pypi` format, namespace `my-namespace` (if applicable), domain `test-domain`, and repository `test-repo`.
       - Check the current origin control configuration for `internal-package` using the AWS CLI or Console and note its `upstream` and `publish` settings. Assume it is initially configured with `upstream=BLOCK,publish=ALLOW` (secure configuration).
    3. **Create a Malicious CSV File (`malicious_config.csv`):**
       ```csv
       domain,repository,namespace,format,package,upstream,publish
       test-domain,test-repo,my-namespace,pypi,internal-package,ALLOW,ALLOW
       ```
       This CSV file is crafted to change the `upstream` setting for `internal-package` to `ALLOW`, weakening the origin control policy.
    4. **Execute `apply_package_configurations.py` with the malicious CSV:**
       ```bash
       python apply_package_configurations.py --region <your-aws-region> --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --input malicious_config.csv --no-backup --dry-run
       ```
       - Run with `--dry-run` first to preview the changes. Review the output to ensure it indicates that the origin configuration for `internal-package` will be changed to `upstream=ALLOW,publish=ALLOW`.
       - If the dry-run output is as expected, execute the script without `--dry-run` to apply the changes:
       ```bash
       python apply_package_configurations.py --region <your-aws-region> --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --input malicious_config.csv --no-backup
       ```
    5. **Verify the Vulnerability:**
       - After running the script, check the origin control configuration for `internal-package` again using the AWS CLI or Console.
       - **Expected Result:** The origin control configuration for `internal-package` should now be `upstream=ALLOW,publish=ALLOW`, demonstrating that the attacker successfully weakened the origin control policy by providing a malicious CSV input.
       - If you had backups enabled, you could restore the original configuration using the `--restore` flag and the same input file.

This security test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the insufficient input validation vulnerability to weaken origin control policies in AWS CodeArtifact using the provided toolkit.
