### Vulnerability 1: Manifest File Manipulation Vulnerability

* Vulnerability Name: Manifest File Manipulation Vulnerability
* Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the system where the manifest file (CSV) generated by `generate_package_configurations.py` is stored before it is used by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    2. The attacker modifies the manifest file. They can change the `upstream` and `publish` flags from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW` for specific packages or namespaces in the CSV file.
    3. The system administrator, unaware of the malicious modification, executes `apply_package_configurations.py` using the compromised manifest file.
    4. `apply_package_configurations.py` reads the modified manifest file and applies the origin control configurations as specified in the tampered CSV.
    5. As a result, the origin control policies in AWS CodeArtifact are weakened or disabled for the targeted packages, potentially re-enabling upstream package sources or allowing unauthorized publishing. This increases the risk of dependency confusion attacks as packages that were intended to be protected by origin control are now vulnerable.
* Impact:
    - Weakened or disabled origin control policies in AWS CodeArtifact, directly undermining the security provided by the toolkit.
    - Increased risk of dependency confusion attacks, where malicious external packages could be substituted for internal packages due to relaxed origin controls.
    - Potential for unauthorized publishing of package versions into the CodeArtifact repository if the `publish` flag is maliciously modified to `ALLOW`.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The tool does not implement any integrity checks or mechanisms to prevent manipulation of the manifest file between generation and application.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for the manifest file. This could involve:
        - **Digital Signatures:** Signing the manifest file upon generation by `generate_package_configurations.py` and verifying the signature in `apply_package_configurations.py` before applying any changes. This would require a key management mechanism.
        - **Checksums/Hashes:** Generating a checksum or hash of the manifest file upon creation and storing it securely. Before applying changes, `apply_package_configurations.py` should re-calculate the checksum and compare it to the stored value.
    - **Access Control on Manifest File:**  Provide guidance or enforce stricter access control policies on the generated manifest file to limit who can read and modify it. This is an operational mitigation rather than a code change.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker must gain access to the file system where the manifest file is stored after being generated by `generate_package_configurations.py` but before being consumed by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    - Attacker needs to have sufficient permissions to modify the manifest file.
    - System administrator must execute `apply_package_configurations.py` using the tampered manifest file.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`apply_package_configurations.py`**:
        - The script reads the input CSV file specified by `--input` argument:
          ```python
          workspace_path = get_backup_file(args.input) if args.restore else args.input
          workspace = WorkspaceManager(workspace_path)
          ```
        - It then iterates through tasks derived from the workspace, which are based on the CSV content:
          ```python
          task_generator = workspace.get_failed_tasks if args.retry_failed else workspace.get_tasks
          processor_function = partial(dispatch_task, codeartifact_client, backup_manager)
          proc = thread_map(processor_function, task_generator(), max_workers=args.num_workers,
                            total=file_length, unit=' packages', desc='Applying origin control changes')
          ```
        - The `WorkspaceManager` in `toolkit/workspace.py` creates tasks directly from the input CSV file content without any integrity checks.
        - The `dispatch_task` function eventually calls `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions` with parameters read directly from the CSV content.
        - There are validations in `validate_file()` function, but these checks are limited to format and allowed values, not content integrity against tampering after generation.

    - **`toolkit/workspace.py`**:
        - `WorkspaceManager` reads the CSV file and creates individual task files in the `todo` directory, directly reflecting the content of the CSV.
        - No mechanism to verify the integrity of the original CSV file after its creation.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    [generate_package_configurations.py] --> origin_configuration.csv (MANIFEST FILE) --> [apply_package_configurations.py] --> AWS CodeArtifact
                                                                    ^
                                                                    |
                                                                    ATTACKER MODIFIES MANIFEST FILE HERE
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - AWS account with CodeArtifact domain and repository set up.
        - AWS CLI configured with credentials that have permissions to manage CodeArtifact origin control policies.
        - Toolkit installed and configured.
    2. **Generate Manifest File:**
        - Run `generate_package_configurations.py` to create a manifest file (e.g., `initial_manifest.csv`). For example:
          ```bash
          python generate_package_configurations.py --region <your_region> --domain <your_domain> --repository <your_repository> --format pypi --output-file initial_manifest.csv
          ```
        - Verify that the `initial_manifest.csv` is generated.
    3. **Inspect Initial Manifest File:**
        - Open `initial_manifest.csv` and note the `upstream` and `publish` values for some packages. They should reflect the default or automatically determined configurations.
    4. **Modify Manifest File (Simulate Attack):**
        - Open `initial_manifest.csv` in a text editor.
        - Locate entries for specific packages (e.g., `pypi`, `example-package`).
        - Change the `upstream` and/or `publish` values for these packages from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW`. For example, if a line is:
          ```csv
          <your_domain>,<your_repository>,pypi,,example-package,BLOCK,ALLOW
          ```
          Modify it to:
          ```csv
          <your_domain>,<your_repository>,pypi,,example-package,ALLOW,ALLOW
          ```
        - Save the modified `initial_manifest.csv`.
    5. **Apply Modified Manifest File:**
        - Run `apply_package_configurations.py` using the *modified* `initial_manifest.csv` as input:
          ```bash
          python apply_package_configurations.py --region <your_region> --domain <your_domain> --repository <your_repository> --input initial_manifest.csv
          ```
    6. **Verify Origin Control Changes in AWS CodeArtifact:**
        - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Console to check the origin control configuration for the packages that were modified in step 4. For example, using AWS CLI:
          ```bash
          aws codeartifact describe-package --domain <your_domain> --repository <your_repository> --format pypi --package example-package
          ```
        - Verify that the origin control restrictions (`upstream` and `publish` flags) for the packages now reflect the *modified* values (`ALLOW`, `ALLOW`) from the tampered manifest file, not the original intended values.
    7. **Cleanup (Optional):**
        - If you want to revert the changes, you can use the backup file (if backups were enabled and not overwritten) and the `--restore` option of `apply_package_configurations.py`. Alternatively, manually reset the origin control configurations in AWS CodeArtifact.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating the manifest file, an attacker can successfully weaken the origin control policies applied by the toolkit.
