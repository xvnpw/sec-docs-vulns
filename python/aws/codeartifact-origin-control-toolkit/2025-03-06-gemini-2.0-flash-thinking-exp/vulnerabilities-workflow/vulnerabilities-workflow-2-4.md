### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: CSV Manifest File Manipulation leading to unintended Origin Control Policy changes
- Description:
  1. An administrator uses the `generate_package_configurations.py` script to create a CSV manifest file containing proposed Package Origin Control policies for an AWS CodeArtifact repository. This file is intended to be used as input for the `apply_package_configurations.py` script.
  2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where the generated CSV manifest file is stored *after* it has been created by `generate_package_configurations.py` but *before* it is used by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
  3. The attacker maliciously modifies the CSV file. Specifically, they alter the `upstream` and/or `publish` policy values for certain packages to weaken the intended security configurations. For example, they might change `upstream=BLOCK` to `upstream=ALLOW` for internal packages, or `publish=BLOCK` to `publish=ALLOW` for external packages.
  4. The administrator, unaware of the tampering, proceeds to use the `apply_package_configurations.py` script, providing the modified, malicious CSV file as input.
  5. The `apply_package_configurations.py` script reads the tampered CSV file and, based on its contents, applies the weakened Origin Control policies to the specified AWS CodeArtifact repository. This action undermines the intended security hardening, potentially increasing the risk of dependency confusion or substitution attacks.
- Impact:
  - The security posture of the AWS CodeArtifact repository is weakened.
  - The risk of dependency confusion attacks or dependency substitution attacks increases, especially if upstream blocking for internal packages is disabled or publishing blocking for external packages is disabled through the manipulated CSV.
  - Internal packages may become vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks if `upstream=BLOCK` policies are maliciously changed to `upstream=ALLOW`, allowing potentially insecure versions from public upstreams to be used.
  - Unauthorized publishing of new package versions becomes possible if `publish=BLOCK` policies are changed to `publish=ALLOW`, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious packages.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation**: The `apply_package_configurations.py` script includes basic validation of the input CSV file. The `validate_file` function checks:
    - If the CSV file has a header.
    - If the header contains all the required fields (`domain`, `repository`, `format`, `namespace`, `package`, `upstream`, `publish`).
    - If the `domain` and `repository` values in each row match the command-line arguments provided to `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    - If the `upstream` and `publish` values in each row are either `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`.
    However, this validation does not prevent the scenario where an attacker modifies the CSV file with valid but malicious policy configurations.
  - **Backup Functionality**: The `apply_package_configurations.py` script, by default, creates a backup of the existing Origin Control policies before applying any changes. This backup can be used to revert to the previous configuration using the `--restore` flag. The backup is stored locally in the `backups` directory. While this allows for recovery, it does not prevent the initial application of malicious policies and potential short-term impact.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Integrity Verification**: There is no mechanism to verify the integrity of the CSV manifest file before it is processed by `apply_package_configurations.py`. Implementing a digital signature or a cryptographic hash for the generated CSV file in `generate_package_configurations.py` and verifying it in `apply_package_configurations.py` would ensure that the file has not been tampered with after generation.
  - **Secure Storage and Access Control Guidance**: The project documentation (README.md) should include strong recommendations for secure storage of the generated CSV manifest file. It should emphasize the need to restrict access to this file to authorized administrators to prevent unauthorized modifications. This is a procedural control, but crucial in mitigating the risk.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must gain unauthorized access to the system's file system where the generated CSV manifest file is stored. This access must occur after the manifest file is generated by `generate_package_configurations.py` and before it is used by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
  - The administrator must execute `apply_package_configurations.py` using the tampered CSV file without noticing or verifying its integrity.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - **`apply_package_configurations.py`**:
    - The script reads the input CSV file specified by the `--input` argument in the `dispatch_work` function.
    - The `validate_file` function is called to perform basic checks on the CSV file's structure and content.
    - The `WorkspaceManager` is initialized with the input CSV file path. This class is responsible for parsing the CSV and creating task files in a workspace directory.
    - The `dispatch_work` function then iterates through the tasks created by the `WorkspaceManager`. Each task corresponds to a row in the CSV file.
    - For each task, the `run_individual_task` function is called. This function:
      - Reads the configuration parameters (domain, repository, format, namespace, package, upstream, publish) from the task (which originates from the CSV row).
      - Optionally performs a backup of the current Origin Control policy using `backup_manager.do_backup`.
      - Calls `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions` to apply the Origin Control policy using the parameters read from the CSV row.
  - **Code Snippet from `apply_package_configurations.py` (relevant part of `run_individual_task`):**
    ```python
    def run_individual_task(codeartifact_client, task, backup_manager):
        task_id, reader, done_callback, error_callback = task
        res = None
        try:
            if args.ask_confirmation and not get_user_confirmation():
                return task_id, res, False
            if backup_manager:
                backup_manager.do_backup(reader(task_id), codeartifact_client.get_restrictions(**reader(task_id)))
            if not args.dry_run:
                res = codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions(**reader(task_id)) # Policy applied based on CSV content
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"error! {e}")
            error_callback(task_id)
            return task_id, res, False

        done_callback(task_id)
        return task_id, res, True
    ```
    - As seen in the code, the `apply_restrictions` function directly uses the `reader(task_id)` to get the parameters, which are derived from the CSV content. There is no integrity check performed on the CSV content itself before these values are used to apply the policies.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have AWS CLI configured with credentials that have permissions to manage CodeArtifact repositories and Package Origin Control policies. You also need a CodeArtifact domain and repository to test against.
  2. **Generate Initial Manifest**: Run `generate_package_configurations.py` to create a manifest file with secure Origin Control policies. For example, to block upstream for all pypi packages with prefix 'internal-' in repository 'test-repo' and domain 'test-domain' in 'us-west-2' region:
     ```bash
     python generate_package_configurations.py --region us-west-2 --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --format pypi --prefix internal- --set-restrictions upstream=BLOCK,publish=ALLOW --output-file initial_manifest.csv
     ```
  3. **Verify Initial Policies (Optional but recommended)**: Before applying, you can manually check the current Origin Control policies for some of the packages listed in `initial_manifest.csv` in the AWS CodeArtifact console or using AWS CLI to confirm the baseline.
  4. **Tamper with the Manifest File**: Open `initial_manifest.csv` in a text editor. Find a few lines where `upstream` is set to `BLOCK` and change them to `upstream=ALLOW`. Save the modified file as `malicious_manifest.csv`.
  5. **Apply Malicious Manifest**: Run `apply_package_configurations.py` using the tampered `malicious_manifest.csv` file:
     ```bash
     python apply_package_configurations.py --region us-west-2 --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --input malicious_manifest.csv
     ```
  6. **Verify Weakened Policies**: Check the Origin Control policies in the AWS CodeArtifact console or using AWS CLI for the packages you modified in `malicious_manifest.csv`. You should observe that the policies have been changed to the weakened state (e.g., `upstream=ALLOW` instead of `upstream=BLOCK`). For example, using AWS CLI to describe package origin configuration:
     ```bash
     aws codeartifact describe-package --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --format pypi --package <package-name-from-modified-csv>
     ```
     Confirm that the `restrictions` section now shows `upstream: ALLOW`.
  7. **(Optional) Restore from Backup**: If you want to revert the changes, you can use the backup created by `apply_package_configurations.py`. First, identify the backup file path (printed during the `apply` command execution or usually in `backups/` directory). Then, run the restore command:
     ```bash
     python apply_package_configurations.py --region us-west-2 --domain test-domain --repository test-repo --input malicious_manifest.csv --restore
     ```
  8. **Verify Restored Policies (Optional)**: After restoring, re-verify the Origin Control policies for the same packages. They should be back to their original, more secure state (e.g., `upstream=BLOCK`).

This test case successfully demonstrates that an attacker can manipulate the CSV manifest file to weaken the Origin Control policies applied by the toolkit.
