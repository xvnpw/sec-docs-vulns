## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability 1: Manifest File Manipulation Vulnerability

* Vulnerability Name: Manifest File Manipulation Vulnerability
* Description:
    1. An administrator uses the `generate_package_configurations.py` script to create a CSV manifest file containing proposed Package Origin Control policies for an AWS CodeArtifact repository. This file is intended to be used as input for the `apply_package_configurations.py` script.
    2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where the generated CSV manifest file is stored *after* it has been created by `generate_package_configurations.py` but *before* it is used by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    3. The attacker maliciously modifies the CSV file. Specifically, they alter the `upstream` and/or `publish` policy values for certain packages to weaken the intended security configurations. For example, they might change `upstream=BLOCK` to `upstream=ALLOW` for internal packages, or `publish=BLOCK` to `publish=ALLOW` for external packages.
    4. The administrator, unaware of the tampering, proceeds to use the `apply_package_configurations.py` script, providing the modified, malicious CSV file as input.
    5. The `apply_package_configurations.py` script reads the tampered CSV file and, based on its contents, applies the weakened Origin Control policies to the specified AWS CodeArtifact repository. This action undermines the intended security hardening, potentially increasing the risk of dependency confusion or substitution attacks.
* Impact:
    - The security posture of the AWS CodeArtifact repository is weakened.
    - The risk of dependency confusion attacks or dependency substitution attacks increases, especially if upstream blocking for internal packages is disabled or publishing blocking for external packages is disabled through the manipulated CSV.
    - Internal packages may become vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks if `upstream=BLOCK` policies are maliciously changed to `upstream=ALLOW`, allowing potentially insecure versions from public upstreams to be used.
    - Unauthorized publishing of new package versions becomes possible if `publish=BLOCK` policies are changed to `publish=ALLOW`, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious packages.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Basic CSV Format Validation**: The `validate_file()` function in `apply_package_configurations.py` performs basic checks on the CSV format, including header presence, required fields (`domain`, `repository`, `format`, `namespace`, `package`, `upstream`, `publish`), and valid values (`ALLOW` or `BLOCK`) for `upstream` and `publish` flags. It also verifies that `domain` and `repository` in each row match the command-line arguments.
    - **User Confirmation Prompt**: The `--ask-confirmation` flag in `apply_package_configurations.py` provides a manual confirmation step before applying changes. If used, the script prompts the administrator to review and confirm each origin control policy change.
    - **Backup Functionality**: The `apply_package_configurations.py` script, by default, creates a backup of the existing Origin Control policies before applying any changes. This backup can be used to revert to the previous configuration using the `--restore` flag. Backups are stored locally in the `backups` directory.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Verification**: Implement integrity checks for the manifest file to ensure it has not been tampered with after generation. This could include:
        - **Digital Signatures:** Signing the manifest file upon generation by `generate_package_configurations.py` and verifying the signature in `apply_package_configurations.py`.
        - **Checksums/Hashes:** Generating a checksum or hash of the manifest file upon creation and verifying it before application.
    - **Semantic Validation of Input CSV**: Implement validation of the content of the origin control policies themselves to ensure they align with security best practices or organizational policies. This could include checks to prevent overly permissive policies, such as alerting or blocking if `upstream` is set to `ALLOW` when it should be `BLOCK` for internal packages.
    - **Secure Storage and Access Control Guidance**: Provide strong recommendations in the project documentation (README.md) for secure storage of the generated CSV manifest file, emphasizing the need to restrict access to authorized administrators.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  The AWS credentials used by the toolkit should adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to specific CodeArtifact repositories and actions, rather than broad AWS account access.
    - **Credential Management Best Practices**: Emphasize secure storage and management of AWS credentials, discouraging storing credentials directly in scripts or configuration files and promoting the use of IAM roles and AWS Secrets Manager.
    - **Audit Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging of all actions performed by the toolkit, especially changes to origin control policies, and integrate with SIEM systems for real-time alerting of suspicious activities.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for AWS accounts and IAM users authorized to run the toolkit.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker must gain access to the file system where the manifest file is stored after being generated by `generate_package_configurations.py` but before being consumed by `apply_package_configurations.py`.
    - Attacker needs to have sufficient permissions to modify the manifest file.
    - System administrator must execute `apply_package_configurations.py` using the tampered manifest file and must have AWS credentials configured with permissions to modify CodeArtifact origin control policies (`codeartifact:PutPackageOriginConfiguration`).
* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`apply_package_configurations.py`**:
        - The script reads the input CSV file specified by the `--input` argument.
        - The `validate_file()` function performs basic CSV format and value validation, but does not check the semantic correctness or security implications of the configurations.
        ```python
        def validate_file():
            with open(args.input, "r") as f:
                reader = csv.DictReader(f)
                validate_header(f, reader)
                for line in reader:
                    validate_line(line, reader.line_num)
            print('File is valid and contains {} lines'.format(reader.line_num))
            return reader.line_num

        def validate_header(f, reader):
            # ... header validation ...

        def validate_line(line, line_number):
            # ... basic line validation (domain, repository, upstream, publish values) ...
        ```
        - The `WorkspaceManager` processes the CSV file and creates tasks based on its content without integrity checks.
        - The `run_individual_task` function executes each task, applying the origin control policies by calling `codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions` using parameters directly derived from the CSV content.
        ```python
        def run_individual_task(codeartifact_client, task, backup_manager):
            task_id, reader, done_callback, error_callback = task
            res = None
            try:
                if args.ask_confirmation and not get_user_confirmation():
                    return task_id, res, False
                if backup_manager:
                    backup_manager.do_backup(reader(task_id), codeartifact_client.get_restrictions(**reader(task_id)))
                if not args.dry_run:
                    res = codeartifact_client.apply_restrictions(**reader(task_id)) # Vulnerable line - policy applied from CSV
            except Exception as e:
                # ... error handling ...

            # ... callbacks ...
            return task_id, res, True
        ```
    - **`toolkit/workspace.py`**:
        - `WorkspaceManager` reads the CSV file and creates task files in the `todo` directory, directly reflecting the content of the CSV. There is no mechanism to verify the integrity of the original CSV file after its creation.
    - **`toolkit/codeartifact_client.py`**:
        - `CodeArtifactClient.apply_restrictions` directly calls the `put_package_origin_configuration` API of AWS CodeArtifact using the parameters provided without additional validation.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    [generate_package_configurations.py] --> origin_configuration.csv (MANIFEST FILE) --> [apply_package_configurations.py] --> AWS CodeArtifact
                                                                    ^
                                                                    |
                                                                    ATTACKER MODIFIES MANIFEST FILE HERE
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - AWS account with CodeArtifact domain and repository set up.
        - AWS CLI configured with credentials that have permissions to manage CodeArtifact origin control policies.
        - Toolkit installed and configured.
    2. **Generate Manifest File:**
        - Run `generate_package_configurations.py` to create a manifest file (e.g., `initial_manifest.csv`).
    3. **Inspect Initial Manifest File:**
        - Open `initial_manifest.csv` and note the `upstream` and `publish` values for some packages (e.g., ensure `upstream` is `BLOCK` for internal packages).
    4. **Modify Manifest File (Simulate Attack):**
        - Open `initial_manifest.csv` in a text editor.
        - Locate entries for specific internal packages.
        - Change the `upstream` value for these packages from `BLOCK` to `ALLOW`.
        - Save the modified `initial_manifest.csv` as `malicious_manifest.csv`.
    5. **Apply Modified Manifest File:**
        - Run `apply_package_configurations.py` using the `malicious_manifest.csv` as input.
    6. **Verify Origin Control Changes in AWS CodeArtifact:**
        - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Console to check the origin control configuration for the packages that were modified in step 4. Verify that the `upstream` policy is now set to `ALLOW`, as specified in the `malicious_manifest.csv`. For example using AWS CLI:
          ```bash
          aws codeartifact describe-package --domain <your_domain> --repository <your_repository> --format <package-format> --package <package-name> --region <your_region>
          ```
    7. **Cleanup (Optional):**
        - If backups were enabled, restore the original configuration using `--restore` flag and the malicious manifest file as input to revert changes.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating the manifest file, an attacker can successfully weaken the origin control policies applied by the toolkit.
