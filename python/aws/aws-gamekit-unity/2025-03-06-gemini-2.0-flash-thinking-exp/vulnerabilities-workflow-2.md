## Combined Vulnerability Report

This report summarizes the identified vulnerabilities, combining information from multiple lists and removing duplicates. Each vulnerability is detailed below with its description, impact, severity, and recommended mitigations.

### 1. Insufficient Input Validation in AWS Service Response Handling

- **Description:**
    1. The AWS GameKit Unity Package interacts with AWS cloud services for game features.
    2. Responses from AWS services are processed by the C++ SDK component of the AWS GameKit Unity Package.
    3. Lack of sufficient input validation in the C++ SDK when handling these responses creates a vulnerability.
    4. An attacker could intercept or manipulate communication with AWS services (e.g., man-in-the-middle, DNS spoofing) to inject malicious responses.
    5. These malicious responses might contain unexpected data formats, overly long strings, or malicious payloads.
    6. The C++ SDK, without proper validation, could misprocess these malicious responses, leading to buffer overflows, format string bugs, or memory corruption.

- **Impact:**
    - Memory corruption within the C++ SDK component.
    - Potential game client crashes.
    - In severe cases, arbitrary code execution on the game client through memory corruption exploits.
    - Information disclosure from memory if the vulnerability allows reading sensitive data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - No explicit input validation is evident in the provided project files for the C++ SDK component when handling AWS service responses. Mitigations are likely missing or insufficient.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement robust input validation in the C++ SDK for all data received from AWS services.
    - Include checks for:
        - Data type validation against expected schemas.
        - Length validation to prevent buffer overflows with strings and arrays.
        - Range validation for numerical values.
        - Format validation (e.g., JSON, XML).
        - Input sanitization to neutralize malicious content before processing.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The game client is actively communicating with AWS services via the AWS GameKit Unity Package.
    - An attacker can intercept or manipulate network traffic between the game client and AWS services, or influence AWS service responses.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - Source code for the C++ SDK component is not provided, limiting detailed analysis.
    - Hypothetically, vulnerabilities could arise in the C++ SDK's response processing logic if:
        - Fixed-size buffers are used without length checks, leading to buffer overflows.
        - String manipulation functions are used without input length validation.
        - Error handling is inadequate, causing crashes or unexpected behavior upon parsing errors.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup Test Environment:** Use a proxy server to intercept game client communications intended for AWS services.
    2. **Identify API Interactions:** Run the game and use AWS GameKit features to identify API requests and expected response formats.
    3. **Craft Malicious Responses:** Create malicious responses with:
        - Oversized strings.
        - Format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%n`).
        - Unexpected data types.
        - Deeply nested structures.
    4. **Intercept and Replace Responses:** Use the proxy to replace legitimate responses with crafted malicious ones.
    5. **Send Malicious Responses to Game Client:** Forward modified responses to the game client.
    6. **Monitor Game Client Behavior:** Observe for crashes, errors in logs, memory corruption (if possible), and unexpected game behavior.
    7. **Analyze Results:** Crashes, errors, or memory corruption upon receiving malicious responses indicate a potential vulnerability in input validation.

### 2. Insecure Storage of AWS Credentials in Client Configuration File

- **Description:**
    The AWS GameKit Unity package stores AWS credentials in the `awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml` file within the `Resources` folder. This file is included in the built game. If developers use long-term AWS credentials (like IAM user access keys) during setup, these credentials become embedded in the game client. Attackers gaining access to game installation files (decompilation, compromised devices) can extract credentials from `awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml`. Exposed credentials with excessive permissions could allow unauthorized access to backend services, player data, or the AWS account. This risk is amplified if developers neglect credential rotation or using least privilege temporary credentials.

- **Impact:** High. Exploitation can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to player data on AWS.
    - **Account Takeover:** Potential control over the AWS account if leaked credentials have admin privileges.
    - **Financial Loss:** Unauthorized AWS resource usage, data exfiltration, and reputational damage.
    - **Game Service Disruption:** Tampering with backend services, causing instability or downtime.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Documentation advises environment separation and switching to "prd" before production builds, suggesting environment awareness, but not directly mitigating credential exposure.
    - Encouragement to use example games with potentially better credential management is not a guaranteed mitigation for all developers.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Enforce/Recommend Temporary Credentials:** Strongly promote or enforce temporary credentials (IAM roles for services, AWS STS) over long-term access keys, especially for production.
    - **Credential Rotation Guidance:** Provide clear instructions and tools for regular credential rotation.
    - **Least Privilege Principle:** Emphasize and guide developers in configuring IAM policies for minimal necessary permissions.
    - **Secure Credential Storage (Client-Side):** If client-side credentials are necessary, implement secure storage mechanisms (platform-specific APIs, encryption) within the game client.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning/Checks:** Implement editor tools to warn developers about potential long-term credential usage or insecure configurations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Developer uses AWS GameKit Unity package and configures it with AWS credentials.
    - Developer uses long-term IAM user access keys instead of temporary credentials.
    - Developer builds the Unity game, including `awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml`.
    - Attacker accesses built game files through decompilation or compromised devices.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - `awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml` is generated and placed in the `Resources` folder, which Unity includes in builds.
    - Documentation confirms this file, created after credential submission, is packaged with the game.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        [Unity Editor with AWS GameKit Plugin] --> (Developer Submits AWS Credentials) --> [awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml created in Packages/com.amazonaws.gamekit/Resources/]
        [Unity Build Process] --> (Packages/com.amazonaws.gamekit/Resources/ included in build) --> [Built Game Files] --> [awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml within game files]
        [Attacker Accesses Game Files] --> (Extracts awsGameKitClientConfig.yaml) --> [Potential AWS Credentials Exposure]
        ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a Unity project, import AWS GameKit, and configure it with **test IAM User Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Select "dev" environment. Build for standalone platform.
    2. **Locate Configuration File:** Find the built game's data folder, then `Resources`, and locate `awsgamedevclientconfig.yaml`.
    3. **Extract and Inspect Credentials:** Open `awsgamedevclientconfig.yaml` and verify if the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are present in plaintext.
    4. **Attempt to Authenticate:** Configure AWS CLI with extracted credentials (`aws configure`).
    5. **Verify Vulnerability:** Execute an AWS CLI command (e.g., `aws s3 ls`) using the extracted credentials. Successful access to AWS resources confirms the vulnerability.
