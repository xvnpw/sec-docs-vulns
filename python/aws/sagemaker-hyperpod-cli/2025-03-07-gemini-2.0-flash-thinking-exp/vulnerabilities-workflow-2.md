## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Path Traversal in `--entry-script` parameter of `hyperpod start-job`

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious path for the `--entry-script` parameter in the `hyperpod start-job` command. This path is designed to traverse outside the intended working directory or allowed script locations.
  2. The user, unaware of the malicious path, executes the `hyperpod start-job` command with the attacker-supplied `--entry-script` value.
  3. Due to insufficient path validation in the `hyperpod-cli`, the command processes the provided path without proper sanitization or checks.
  4. When the training job starts, the container runtime attempts to execute the script located at the attacker-specified path.
  5. If the attacker has successfully crafted a path that points to a malicious script outside the intended directory (e.g., using "../" sequences to go up directories and then into a different location within the file system accessible to the container), this malicious script will be executed within the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

- **Impact:**
  - **Unauthorized Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the SageMaker HyperPod cluster's container.
  - **Data Breach:** The attacker's script could potentially access sensitive data, including training data, models, environment variables, or credentials stored within the cluster or accessible from it.
  - **System Compromise:** The malicious script could be designed to compromise the training job environment, potentially leading to further attacks within the cluster or the underlying infrastructure.
  - **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Depending on the container's security context and the nature of the malicious script, it might be possible for the attacker to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to cluster resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, there are **no currently implemented mitigations** visible within the documentation, Helm charts, or other configuration files. The provided files consist of Kubernetes manifests (CRDs, Roles, RoleBindings, ConfigMaps, Services, Deployments, HPAs), Helm chart configurations, example job configurations, setup scripts, documentation configurations, and various Python modules related to CLI functionality, Kubernetes client, constants, telemetry, commands and services.  None of these files contain source code that implements input validation or sanitization for the `--entry-script` parameter within the `hyperpod-cli` itself. Therefore, it remains impossible to ascertain any mitigations from these files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Path Sanitization:** The `--entry-script` path should be rigorously sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks. This should include:
    - Validating that the path is within an expected directory or a set of allowed directories (whitelisting).
    - Removing or neutralizing path traversal sequences like "../" and similar.
    - Canonicalizing the path to resolve symbolic links and ensure it points to the intended location.
  - **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on the `--entry-script` parameter to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain malicious characters or sequences.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the containers running training jobs operate with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of unauthorized code execution. This includes using non-root users, dropping capabilities, and using seccomp profiles and AppArmor/SELinux policies.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. **User Interaction:** A user must execute the `hyperpod start-job` command, and they must be convinced (e.g., via social engineering or supply chain attack) to use a malicious `--entry-script` path provided by the attacker.
  2. **Vulnerable `hyperpod-cli` Version:** The `hyperpod-cli` version being used must be vulnerable to path traversal, meaning it lacks proper path sanitization for the `--entry-script` parameter.
  3. **Accessible File System:** The container running the training job must have access to parts of the file system outside the intended script directory where the attacker can place or reference a malicious script.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **Note:** The provided PROJECT FILES do not include the Python source code of the `hyperpod-cli`. Therefore, the following source code analysis is hypothetical and based on the vulnerability description and common patterns in command-line tools.

  - **Assumed Vulnerable Code Snippet (Python - Hypothetical):**

    ```python
    import subprocess

    def start_job(entry_script, ...):
        # ... other parameters processing ...

        command = ["torchrun", entry_script] # Vulnerable line - directly using user-supplied path

        try:
            subprocess.run(command, check=True)
            print("Job started successfully.")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Job failed to start: {e}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # ... command line argument parsing using click or argparse ...
        # Assume entry_script is obtained from --entry-script parameter

        start_job(entry_script=entry_script, ...)
    ```

  - **Vulnerability Explanation:**
    - In this hypothetical code, the `entry_script` variable, which directly comes from the user-provided `--entry-script` parameter, is used in the `subprocess.run()` command without any validation or sanitization.
    - If an attacker provides a path like `/home/attacker/malicious_script.py` or `../../../../home/attacker/malicious_script.sh` as the value for `--entry-script`, the `subprocess.run()` command will execute this script directly.
    - There is no check to ensure that `entry_script` points to a file within a safe or expected directory.

  - **Visualization (Conceptual):**

    ```
    User Input (--entry-script) --> [hyperpod-cli Python Code] --> subprocess.run() --> Container Execution --> Malicious Script Executed (Path Traversal)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Attacker needs access to a SageMaker HyperPod cluster (or a test environment mimicking it).
     - Attacker needs to be able to execute `hyperpod-cli` commands.
     - Attacker needs to prepare a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_script.sh`) and place it in a location accessible from within the container but outside the intended script directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_script.sh`).

  2. **Steps:**
     a. **Create Malicious Script:** Create a simple shell script `malicious_script.sh` in `/tmp/` directory (or any other accessible location outside the intended script directory) on a system that can be accessed or simulated as accessible by the training job container. This script could simply write to a file to demonstrate execution:

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Malicious script executed!" > /tmp/vulnerable.txt
        ```
        Make the script executable: `chmod +x /tmp/malicious_script.sh`

     b. **Craft `hyperpod start-job` Command:** Construct a `hyperpod start-job` command that utilizes path traversal in the `--entry-script` parameter to point to the malicious script.  For example:

        ```bash
        hyperpod start-job --job-name traversal-test --image <your_training_image> --entry-script /tmp/malicious_script.sh --instance-type ml.p4d.24xlarge --node-count 1
        ```
        **Note:** Replace `<your_training_image>` with a valid training image available in your environment and `--instance-type` with a valid instance type for your HyperPod cluster. You might need to adjust the path `/tmp/malicious_script.sh` based on the container's accessible file system and where you placed the malicious script. You might also need to include other required parameters for `hyperpod start-job` as per your environment and the CLI's requirements.

     c. **Execute the Command:** Run the crafted `hyperpod start-job` command.

     d. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - **Check for Side Effects:** After the job (or even if the job fails due to other configuration issues but the script execution is attempted), check if the side effect of the malicious script has occurred. In this test case, check if the file `/tmp/vulnerable.txt` has been created within the container or in a location accessible from the container's context. You might need to access the container logs or execute commands within the container (using `hyperpod exec` if available and if it doesn't further complicate the test due to potential sanitization in `hyperpod exec` itself, or using Kubernetes `kubectl exec` directly if you have cluster access) to verify the file creation or other actions of the malicious script.

  3. **Expected Result:**
     - If the vulnerability exists, the `malicious_script.sh` will be executed. Verification would be through the presence of `/tmp/vulnerable.txt` file or other observable side effects defined in the malicious script, confirming unauthorized code execution via path traversal.
     - If the vulnerability is mitigated, the job should either fail to start (due to path validation) or execute without running the malicious script (if path traversal is neutralized). In this case, `/tmp/vulnerable.txt` should not be created, and the malicious script's intended actions should not be observed.

### Vulnerability: Command Injection in `hyperpod exec` command

- **Description:**
  - An attacker can use the `hyperpod exec` command to execute commands inside a container of a pod associated with a training job.
  - The attacker can inject malicious commands by crafting a payload within the `-- <command>` argument of the `hyperpod exec` command.
  - When the `hyperpod exec` command is processed, the injected commands are executed directly by the system shell within the container's context.

- **Impact:**
  - Successful command injection allows for unauthorized code execution within the training job's container.
  - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Data exfiltration from the training environment.
    - Modification or corruption of training data and models.
    - Lateral movement to other containers or resources within the cluster if the compromised container has sufficient permissions.
    - In a severe scenario, if the container runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root user, or with specific capabilities), it could potentially lead to node compromise or broader cluster-level impact.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Based on the provided project files, there are **no currently implemented mitigations** within the project code (HyperPod CLI) to prevent command injection in the `hyperpod exec` functionality. The documentation does not mention any input sanitization or security considerations for the `command` argument.
  - However, the provided CRD files define extensive security context options for pods and containers. These options, if properly configured when deploying training jobs, can **mitigate the impact** of a potential command injection by limiting the container's privileges and access. Examples include setting `runAsNonRoot`, dropping capabilities, and using `seccompProfile`. It is important to note that these are Kubernetes-level security features and require explicit configuration during job deployment; they are not default mitigations implemented by the HyperPod CLI itself. The HyperPod CLI project itself does not implement any mitigations for this vulnerability.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `command` argument in the `hyperpod exec` functionality. This should include:
    - **Whitelisting allowed commands:** If possible, restrict the allowed commands to a predefined whitelist.
    - **Escaping shell metacharacters:** Properly escape shell metacharacters (e.g., `&`, `;`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, `!`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `*`, `?`, `~`, `[`, `]`, `#`, `^`, ` `) in the user-provided command before passing it to the shell.
    - **Using parameterized execution:** If feasible, use parameterized execution methods to separate commands from arguments, preventing injection.
  - **Command parsing:** Instead of directly passing the user-provided string to a shell, parse the command and arguments to ensure they conform to expected formats.
  - **Principle of least privilege:** While the CRDs provide options for security contexts, ensure that the containers in which commands are executed operate with the minimum necessary privileges by default. This should be enforced in the HyperPod CLI and job deployment configurations to reduce the impact of a successful command injection attack.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must have access to the `hyperpod` CLI tool. This assumes the attacker is a user who has installed the CLI, as described in the `README.md` installation instructions.
  - The attacker needs to be authenticated and authorized to interact with the HyperPod cluster, implying they have configured `kubectl` to connect to the cluster.
  - To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must know the name of a running training job within the HyperPod cluster to target with the `hyperpod exec` command.
  - The `hyperpod exec` command in the CLI tool must be implemented in a way that is vulnerable to command injection, specifically by unsafely processing the `-- <command>` argument.

    - **Conclusion:** The source code analysis reveals a direct passthrough of the user-supplied command to the Kubernetes API without any input sanitization. This confirms the presence of a command injection vulnerability. No mitigations are implemented in the examined code.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Set up the environment:
     - Assume you have successfully installed the `hyperpod` CLI tool as described in the `README.md`.
     - Assume you have configured `kubectl` to connect to your HyperPod cluster and have the necessary permissions to execute commands within training job containers.
     - Ensure you have a running training job in your HyperPod cluster. For this test, let's assume a job named `vuln-test-job` is running in the `kubeflow` namespace.
  2. Execute the `hyperpod exec` command with a command injection payload:
     ```bash
     hyperpod exec --job-name vuln-test-job --namespace kubeflow -- -- bash -c 'mkdir /tmp/hyperpod-vuln-test'
     ```
     - This command attempts to inject a command that creates a directory named `hyperpod-vuln-test` in the `/tmp` directory of the container.
  3. Verify successful command injection:
     - To verify if the command injection was successful, you need to access the container of one of the pods associated with the `vuln-test-job`. You can use `kubectl exec` to get a shell inside the container.
     - First, list the pods associated with the job to get a pod name:
       ```bash
       kubectl get pods -n kubeflow -l pytorch-job-name=vuln-test-job
       ```
       - Let's say you get a pod name like `vuln-test-job-worker-0`. Now, execute a command inside the container to check if the directory `/tmp/hyperpod-vuln-test` was created:
       ```bash
       kubectl exec -it -n kubeflow vuln-test-job-worker-0 -- bash
       ```
       - Once inside the container shell, check for the directory:
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/
       ```
       - If you see `hyperpod-vuln-test` in the list, it confirms that the command injection was successful and the `mkdir /tmp/hyperpod-vuln-test` command was executed within the container.
  4. Expected result:
     - If the vulnerability exists, the `hyperpod exec` command should execute the injected command, and the `/tmp/hyperpod-vuln-test` directory should be created in the container. This confirms the command injection vulnerability in the `hyperpod exec` command.
