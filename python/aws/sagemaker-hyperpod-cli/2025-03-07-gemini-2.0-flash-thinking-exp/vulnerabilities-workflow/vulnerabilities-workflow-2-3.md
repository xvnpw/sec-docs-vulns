- Vulnerability name: Command Injection in `hyperpod exec` command

- Description:
    1. An attacker uses the `hyperpod exec` command to execute commands within a training job container.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious command string.
    3. If the `hyperpod exec` command does not properly sanitize user-provided command strings, the malicious command is injected directly into a shell execution context within the container.
    4. This results in the execution of attacker-controlled commands within the training job's container.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution within the training job's container.
    - Potential data exfiltration from the training job's environment.
    - Modification or deletion of training data or models.
    - Container compromise, potentially leading to further lateral movement within the cluster if misconfigurations exist.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided project files. The files are primarily documentation and Helm chart configurations, lacking the source code where mitigation would be implemented.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `<command>` argument in the `hyperpod exec` command. This should include escaping or rejecting shell metacharacters and potentially using parameterized execution methods to prevent injection.
    - Command parsing: Instead of directly passing the user-provided string to a shell, parse the command and arguments to ensure they conform to expected formats.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the container environment and the HyperPod CLI tool itself operate with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful command injection.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must have access to the `hyperpod` CLI tool and be authorized to use the `exec` command on a training job.
    - The HyperPod CLI tool must be configured to connect to a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
    - The target HyperPod cluster must have running training jobs.

- Source code analysis:
    - The `hyperpod exec` command is defined in `src/hyperpod_cli/commands/pod.py` and its execution logic resides in `src/hyperpod_cli/service/exec_command.py`.
    - In `src/hyperpod_cli/commands/pod.py`, the `exec` function takes user inputs such as `job_name`, `pod`, `namespace`, and `bash_command`.
    - The `bash_command` is passed as a tuple and processed in `src/hyperpod_cli/service/exec_command.py`'s `exec_command` function.
    - The `exec_command` function in `src/hyperpod_cli/service/exec_command.py` concatenates the `bash_command` tuple into a single string using `' '.join(after_seperator)`.
    - This command string is then directly passed to the `exec_command_on_pod` function of the `KubernetesClient` in `src/hyperpod_cli/clients/kubernetes_client.py`.
    - In `src/hyperpod_cli/clients/kubernetes_client.py`, the `exec_command_on_pod` function utilizes the Kubernetes Python client's `stream.stream` function.
    - The user-provided `bash_command_str` is directly passed as the `command` argument to `client.CoreV1Api().connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec`.
    - **Visualization of Code Flow:**
        ```
        User Input (bash_command)
            |
            v
        src/hyperpod_cli/commands/pod.py (exec function)
            |
            v
        src/hyperpod_cli/service/exec_command.py (exec_command function)
            |  No Input Sanitization
            v
        src/hyperpod_cli/clients/kubernetes_client.py (exec_command_on_pod function)
            |  Directly passes command to Kubernetes API
            v
        Kubernetes API (stream.stream) -> Container Execution
        ```
    - **Conclusion:** The source code analysis reveals a direct passthrough of the user-supplied command to the Kubernetes API without any input sanitization. This confirms the presence of a command injection vulnerability. No mitigations are implemented in the examined code.

- Security test case:
    1. Prerequisites:
        - Install and configure the `hyperpod` CLI tool according to the installation instructions in `README.md`.
        - Connect to a HyperPod cluster using `hyperpod connect-cluster`.
        - Start a training job using `hyperpod start-job` (or use an existing running job).
        - Identify a running pod name associated with the job using `hyperpod list-pods --job-name <job-name>`.
    2. Execute a command injection attempt using `hyperpod exec`:
        ```bash
        hyperpod exec --job-name <job-name> -p <pod-name> -- bash -c 'touch /tmp/pwned'
        ```
        Replace `<job-name>` with the name of your training job and `<pod-name>` with the name of a pod from that job.
    3. Verify command execution:
        - Execute another `hyperpod exec` command to check for the created file:
        ```bash
        hyperpod exec --job-name <job-name> -p <pod-name> -- ls /tmp/
        ```
        - If the output of the second command includes `pwned`, the command injection is successful.
    4. Expected result:
        - If vulnerable, the `ls /tmp/` command output will list the `pwned` file, indicating successful command injection.
        - If mitigated, the `touch /tmp/pwned` command should not execute within the container, and the `ls /tmp/` command will not show the `pwned` file.
