- vulnerability name: Command Injection in `hyperpod exec`
- description:
    1. An attacker can use the `hyperpod exec` command to execute arbitrary commands within the container of a pod.
    2. The `-- <command>` argument in `hyperpod exec` is intended to allow users to run commands inside a container.
    3. However, the application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-provided command.
    4. An attacker can inject malicious commands by crafting a command string that includes shell metacharacters or command separators.
    5. When the `hyperpod exec` command is executed, the unsanitized user-provided command is passed directly to a shell (e.g., bash) within the container.
    6. The shell interprets the malicious commands, leading to arbitrary code execution within the container's context.
- impact:
    - **High/Critical**: Successful command injection can lead to complete compromise of the training job's container.
    - An attacker could potentially:
        - Steal sensitive data, including training data, model weights, and credentials stored within the container.
        - Modify training processes, leading to model poisoning or denial of service.
        - Use the compromised container as a pivot point to attack other parts of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster or the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure, depending on the container's permissions and network access.
        - Disrupt or sabotage the training job, causing financial and reputational damage.
- vulnerability rank: Critical
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - Based on the provided files, there are **no currently implemented mitigations** within the project code (HyperPod CLI) to prevent command injection in the `hyperpod exec` functionality. The documentation does not mention any input sanitization or security considerations for the `command` argument.
    - However, the provided CRD files (`xgboostjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, `pytorchjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, `tfjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, `paddlejobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`) define extensive security context options for pods and containers. These options, if properly configured when deploying training jobs, can **mitigate the impact** of a potential command injection by limiting the container's privileges and access. Examples include setting `runAsNonRoot`, dropping capabilities, and using `seccompProfile`. It is important to note that these are Kubernetes-level security features and require explicit configuration during job deployment; they are not default mitigations implemented by the HyperPod CLI itself. The HyperPod CLI project itself does not implement any mitigations for this vulnerability.
- missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `command` argument in the `hyperpod exec` functionality. This should include:
        - **Whitelisting allowed commands:** If possible, restrict the allowed commands to a predefined whitelist.
        - **Escaping shell metacharacters:** Properly escape shell metacharacters (e.g., `&`, `;`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, `!`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `*`, `?`, `~`, `[`, `]`, `#`, `^`, ` `) in the user-provided command before passing it to the shell.
        - **Using parameterized execution:** If feasible, use parameterized execution methods to separate commands from arguments, preventing injection.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** While the CRDs provide options for security contexts, ensure that the containers in which commands are executed operate with the minimum necessary privileges by default. This should be enforced in the HyperPod CLI and job deployment configurations to reduce the impact of a successful command injection attack.
- preconditions:
    - An attacker must have access to the HyperPod CLI tool and be able to execute `hyperpod exec` commands.
    - A training job must be running on the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
    - The attacker needs to know the job name and optionally pod name to target the command execution.
- source code analysis:
    - **Limitation:** The provided project files do not include the Python source code for the `hyperpod` CLI. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis of the `hyperpod exec` command handling is not possible with the current files. The provided CRD files define Kubernetes resource configurations and do not contain the CLI's source code.
    - **CRD Security Context Options:** The CRD files (`xgboostjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, `pytorchjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, `tfjobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`, and `paddlejobs.kubeflow.org-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml`) define extensive `securityContext` options for containers within the pods. These options can be configured to restrict container capabilities, user IDs, and filesystem access, which can reduce the potential damage from a command injection exploit. However, these are impact-mitigation measures and do not address the root cause vulnerability in the `hyperpod exec` command handling.
    - **Assumed Vulnerable Code Pattern (based on documentation and attack vector):**
        - It is assumed that the Python code for `hyperpod exec` directly constructs a shell command using the user-provided `-- <command>` argument and executes it within the target container using a library like `subprocess` or a Kubernetes client's `exec` functionality without proper sanitization.
        - **Example of Potentially Vulnerable Code (Conceptual Python):**
        ```python
        import subprocess

        def hyperpod_exec_command(job_name, pod_name, user_command):
            # ... (code to connect to Kubernetes cluster and get pod information) ...

            container_name = "main-container" # Assume main container name
            namespace = "user-namespace" # Assume user namespace

            # Vulnerable command construction - NO SANITIZATION of user_command
            full_command = f"kubectl exec -n {namespace} pod/{pod_name} -c {container_name} -- {user_command}"

            try:
                process = subprocess.Popen(full_command, shell=True, executable='/bin/bash',
                                           stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
                stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
                if process.returncode != 0:
                    print(f"Command execution failed: {stderr.decode()}")
                else:
                    print(stdout.decode())
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error executing command: {e}")

        # ... (CLI argument parsing) ...
        if command == 'exec':
            job_name = args['job_name']
            pod_name = args['pod']
            user_command = args['command'] # User-provided command directly from CLI
            hyperpod_exec_command(job_name, pod_name, user_command)
        ```
        - **Visualization:**

        ```
        [Attacker Input (CLI): hyperpod exec --job-name my-job -p my-pod -- "$(malicious_command)"]
            |
            V
        [HyperPod CLI (Python - Assumed Vulnerable Code)] --> Constructs Shell Command (NO SANITIZATION)
            |  full_command = "kubectl exec ... -- $(malicious_command)"
            V
        [subprocess.Popen(full_command, shell=True)] --> Executes command in shell
            |
            V
        [Shell (bash in container)] --> Executes "$(malicious_command)" - Command Injection!
            |
            V
        [Container in Kubernetes Pod] --> Arbitrary Code Execution
        ```

- security test case:
    1. **Precondition:** Have a SageMaker HyperPod cluster setup and kubectl configured to interact with it. Ensure a training job is running and you know the job name and at least one pod name associated with it.
    2. **Execute `hyperpod connect-cluster`**: Connect the HyperPod CLI to your cluster:
        ```bash
        hyperpod connect-cluster --cluster-name <your-cluster-name>
        ```
    3. **Attempt command injection using `hyperpod exec`**: Use the `hyperpod exec` command to inject a malicious command that will create a file in the container's `/tmp` directory. Replace `<your-job-name>` and `<your-pod-name>` with actual values from your running training job.
        ```bash
        hyperpod exec --job-name <your-job-name> -p <your-pod-name> -- touch /tmp/pwned.txt
        ```
    4. **Verify command execution**:
        - Execute another `hyperpod exec` command to check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` was created successfully.
        ```bash
        hyperpod exec --job-name <your-job-name> -p <your-pod-name> -- ls /tmp/
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the output of the `ls /tmp/` command should include `pwned.txt`, confirming that the `touch /tmp/pwned.txt` command was successfully injected and executed in the container.

    5. **Cleanup (Optional):** Delete the created file:
        ```bash
        hyperpod exec --job-name <your-job-name> -p <your-pod-name> -- rm /tmp/pwned.txt
        ```
