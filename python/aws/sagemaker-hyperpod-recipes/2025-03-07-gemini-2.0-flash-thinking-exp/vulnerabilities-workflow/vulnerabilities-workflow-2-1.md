- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Test Submission Scripts via `results_dir` Parameter
  - Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to modify or influence the test submission scripts (e.g., `sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh`) or the parameters used by them.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious `results_dir` string containing shell commands, for example: `"; touch /tmp/pwned; "`.
    3. The attacker executes the modified test submission script.
    4. During the execution of the script, the `{$results_dir}` variable, now containing the malicious payload, is expanded within shell commands, such as in `srun -l bash -c "scontrol show hostnames | sort > {$results_dir}/llama-8b/hostname"` or `srun -l bash {$results_dir}/llama-8b/launch_docker_container.sh`.
    5. The injected shell commands within the `results_dir` are executed, in this example, creating a file `/tmp/pwned`.
  - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the head node of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster or the environment where the test submission script is executed.
    - This can lead to:
      - Data exfiltration by redirecting sensitive information to attacker-controlled servers.
      - System compromise by creating backdoor accounts or modifying system files.
      - Lateral movement to other parts of the infrastructure if the test environment is connected to internal networks.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any input sanitization or command injection prevention mechanisms in the test submission scripts.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for the `results_dir` parameter in test submission scripts.
    - Avoid using string interpolation with user-controlled parameters directly in shell commands.
    - Implement secure coding practices, such as parameterized commands or shell escaping, to prevent command injection.
    - Principle of least privilege should be applied to the test execution environment to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the test submission scripts or control the `results_dir` parameter before the script execution. This is a less likely scenario for external attackers against a production system, but more relevant in development or CI/CD environments if those are not properly secured.
  - Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/tests/slurm_workflow/slurm_baseline_artifacts/llama-8b/sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh`
    - Lines:
      ```bash
      #SBATCH --output={$results_dir}/llama-8b/log-sagemaker-llama-8b_%j.out
      # ...
      # Prepare distributed files
      srun -l bash -c "scontrol show hostnames | sort > {$results_dir}/llama-8b/hostname"

      srun -l bash {$results_dir}/llama-8b/launch_docker_container.sh
      srun -l bash {$results_dir}/llama-8b/docker_exec_script.sh
      ```
    - Visualization:
      ```
      User Input (Malicious results_dir) --> sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh --> Shell Command Expansion ({$results_dir} in commands) --> Command Execution (Injected commands executed)
      ```
    - The `{$results_dir}` variable is directly embedded into shell commands executed by `srun -l bash -c` and `srun -l bash`. This allows for command injection if the content of `{$results_dir}` is attacker-controlled. The lack of sanitization on `{$results_dir}` before its use in shell commands creates this vulnerability.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a test environment where you can execute the `sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh` script.
    2. Modify the `sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh` script or its environment to set the `results_dir` variable to a malicious value, for example: `results_dir='"; touch /tmp/pwned; "'`. For testing purposes, you might directly modify the script to hardcode this malicious value for `results_dir` instead of relying on external input.
    3. Execute the modified `sagemaker-llama-8b_submission.sh` script.
    4. After the script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present, as the injected `touch /tmp/pwned` command was successfully executed.
