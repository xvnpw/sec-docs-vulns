### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Data Path Handling leading to Model Poisoning and Unauthorized Data Access
- Description:
  1. The Amazon SageMaker HyperPod recipes project utilizes YAML recipe files to define training configurations, including paths to training and validation datasets (`train_dir`, `val_dir`).
  2. Launcher scripts, primarily shell scripts, are responsible for reading these recipe files and passing the data directory parameters to the training scripts executed within containers.
  3. The launcher scripts, such as `launcher_scripts/llama/run_hf_llama3_8b_seq16k_gpu_p5x16_pretrain.sh`, directly accept environment variables like `TRAIN_DIR` and `VAL_DIR` to specify data paths and pass them as command-line arguments to `main.py`.
  4. If these recipes or environment variables are not adequately validated or sanitized, a malicious actor could manipulate these paths to point to unauthorized data sources or inject malicious training data. This can lead to model poisoning or unauthorized data access.
- Impact:
  - Model Poisoning: Attackers can compromise the integrity of the trained model by substituting legitimate training data with malicious datasets, leading to unpredictable model behavior, biases, or backdoors.
  - Unauthorized Data Access: By manipulating data paths, attackers might gain unintended access to sensitive data residing in locations specified by the altered paths during the training process.
  - Potential AWS Resource Access: If the training process is designed to interact with other AWS resources based on these data paths, manipulation could extend to unauthorized access to other AWS services.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The project incorporates `validations_wrapper.py`, `TypeValidator`, and `ValueValidator` to perform configuration validation. These components are intended to check the types and values of configuration parameters, acting as a preliminary security measure. However, the extent to which these validations specifically address data path sanitization and malicious input prevention is not evident from the provided files.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Robust Input Sanitization and Validation: Implement comprehensive validation checks for data paths from recipes and environment variables to ensure they are legitimate, authorized, and safe. Include path traversal prevention and restrictions on allowed data source locations.
  - Principle of Least Privilege: Configure training containers and scripts to operate with minimal necessary permissions, thereby limiting potential damage from exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  - Security Documentation: Provide clear documentation outlining security best practices for users, specifically concerning the configuration and safeguarding of data paths within recipes and launcher scripts.
- Preconditions:
  - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs the ability to:
    - Modify recipe files, which might be possible if the attacker gains access to the project's repository or configuration storage.
    - Control environment variables used by the launcher scripts, which is a more readily achievable precondition for external attackers with access to the execution environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/launcher_scripts/llama/run_hf_llama3_8b_seq16k_gpu_p5x16_pretrain.sh`:
    ```bash
    TRAIN_DIR="${TRAIN_DIR}" # Location of training dataset
    VAL_DIR="${VAL_DIR}" # Location of validation dataset
    EXP_DIR="${EXP_DIR}" # Location to save experiment info including logging, checkpoints, etc.

    HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 python3 ${SAGEMAKER_TRAINING_LAUNCHER_DIR}/main.py \
        recipes=training/llama/hf_llama3_8b_seq16k_gpu_p5x16_pretrain \
        base_results_dir=${SAGEMAKER_TRAINING_LAUNCHER_DIR}/results \
        recipes.run.name="hf-llama3-8b" \
        recipes.exp_manager.exp_dir=$EXP_DIR \
        recipes.model.data.train_dir=$TRAIN_DIR \
        recipes.model.data.val_dir=$VAL_DIR
    ```
    - This script directly passes the values of environment variables `TRAIN_DIR` and `VAL_DIR` to the `main.py` script as command-line arguments, without any explicit sanitization in this script.

  - File: `/code/main.py`:
    - `main.py` uses Hydra to manage configurations, including those potentially derived from recipe files and command-line arguments.
    - While `validations_wrapper.py` suggests input validation is in place, the specifics regarding data path validation and protection against malicious inputs require further investigation to confirm effectiveness.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Preconditions:
      - Set up a testing environment capable of running the project's launcher scripts.
      - Ensure you can set environment variables before executing launcher scripts.
  2. Steps:
      - Select a launcher script, for example, `launcher_scripts/llama/run_hf_llama3_8b_seq16k_gpu_p5x16_pretrain.sh`.
      - Set the environment variable `TRAIN_DIR` to a local directory containing a harmless, easily identifiable dataset (e.g., a small text file), simulating a malicious data source for testing without causing harm.
      - Execute the chosen launcher script with the modified `TRAIN_DIR` environment variable.
      - Monitor the training job execution. Verify if the training process utilizes data from the attacker-defined `TRAIN_DIR` instead of the expected legitimate dataset.
      - If feasible, examine the resulting trained model to detect any signs of data poisoning due to the injected malicious data.
  3. Expected Result:
      - Ideally, the system should reject the malicious data path due to validation mechanisms and terminate the training job with an error or warning message.
      - If validation is insufficient, the training process will proceed using the manipulated data, confirming the vulnerability.
      - A successful exploit might be evidenced by a poisoned model, exhibiting altered behavior as a result of training on attacker-controlled data.
