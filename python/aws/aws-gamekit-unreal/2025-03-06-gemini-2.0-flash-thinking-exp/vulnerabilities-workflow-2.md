### Vulnerabilities List

#### Vulnerability 1: Insecure API Authorization on Achievements Feature

- **Vulnerability Name:** Achievements API endpoints publicly accessible due to misconfigured authorization.
- **Description:** The CloudFormation template for the Achievements feature (`/code/AwsGameKit/Resources/cloudResources/cloudformation/achievements/cloudFormation.yml`) defines API Gateway methods for accessing achievement data. By default, these methods are configured with `AuthorizationType: COGNITO_USER_POOLS` when not using a third-party identity provider. However, if a developer using this plugin incorrectly configures or removes this authorization, the Achievements API endpoints could become publicly accessible, allowing unauthorized users to view or manipulate achievement data.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to achievement data. Attackers could potentially read all achievements, modify player achievements, or unlock achievements for themselves or others, disrupting the game's intended progression and potentially impacting player experience and fairness.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** The default CloudFormation template sets `AuthorizationType: COGNITO_USER_POOLS` which, if correctly deployed and used by the game developer, should enforce authorization.
    - File: `/code/AwsGameKit/Resources/cloudResources/cloudformation/achievements/cloudFormation.yml` - `CognitoAuthorizer` and `GetAchievementsApiResourceGetMethod`, `GetAchievementApiResourceGetMethod`, `UpdateAchievementsApiResourcePostMethod` resources.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Clear documentation and warnings for game developers emphasizing the importance of maintaining the default authorization settings and the security risks of modifying them.
    - Security test cases and guidelines for developers to verify that authorization is correctly implemented in their game.
    - Ideally, the plugin should enforce authorization at the plugin level, preventing developers from easily disabling it.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Game developer modifies the default CloudFormation template to remove or weaken the authorization on the Achievements API endpoints (e.g., changes `AuthorizationType` to `NONE`).
    - The modified CloudFormation template is deployed to AWS.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/AwsGameKit/Resources/cloudResources/cloudformation/achievements/cloudFormation.yml`
        - The `GetAchievementsApiResourceGetMethod`, `GetAchievementApiResourceGetMethod`, and `UpdateAchievementsApiResourcePostMethod` resources define the API Gateway methods for the Achievements feature.
        - They use `AuthorizationType: !If [ IsUsingThirdPartyIdentityProvider, CUSTOM, COGNITO_USER_POOLS ]` which defaults to `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` if `UseThirdPartyIdentityProvider` is false (default).
        - A vulnerability is introduced if a developer directly modifies this template and changes `AuthorizationType` to `NONE` or removes the `AuthorizerId` property. This would bypass the intended authorization mechanism.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the AWS GameKit plugin with the Achievements feature enabled using the default CloudFormation template.
    2. Obtain the `achievements_api_gateway_base_url` from the `clientConfig.yml` output.
    3. Attempt to access the `/achievements` endpoint (e.g., using `curl` or a browser) without providing any authorization headers (e.g., `Authorization` header).
    4. Expected Result: Access is denied (e.g., HTTP 401 Unauthorized or similar) because Cognito User Pools authorization is enforced.
    5. Modify the `/code/AwsGameKit/Resources/cloudResources/cloudformation/achievements/cloudFormation.yml` template:
        - Locate the `GetAchievementsApiResourceGetMethod` resource.
        - Change `AuthorizationType: !If [ IsUsingThirdPartyIdentityProvider, CUSTOM, COGNITO_USER_POOLS ]` to `AuthorizationType: NONE`.
        - Deploy the modified CloudFormation template.
    6. Repeat step 3.
    7. Actual Result: Access is now allowed (e.g., HTTP 200 OK) and achievement data is returned without any authentication. This confirms the vulnerability.
