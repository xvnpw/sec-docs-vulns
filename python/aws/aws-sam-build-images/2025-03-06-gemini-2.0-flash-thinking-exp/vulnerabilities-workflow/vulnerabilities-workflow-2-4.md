Based on the provided vulnerability list and instructions, let's analyze the given vulnerability "Docker Content Trust Disabled" against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

**Analysis of "Docker Content Trust Disabled" vulnerability:**

*   **Valid vulnerability and part of the attack vector:** Yes, disabling Docker Content Trust is a valid vulnerability that directly aligns with the described attack vector of tricking developers into using malicious images. By disabling signature verification, the script makes it easier for attackers to inject compromised images into the build process.

*   **Exclude vulnerabilities that:**
    *   **are only missing documentation to mitigate:** No, this vulnerability description includes both currently implemented and missing mitigations.
    *   **are deny of service vulnerabilities:** No, this is a supply chain vulnerability related to code injection, not a denial of service.
    *   **are not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world:** No, this is a realistic attack scenario. Attackers can target public registries or attempt to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to serve malicious images. Disabling content trust makes such attacks significantly easier to execute successfully.
    *   **are not completely described, e.g. missing source code analysis or security test case:** No, the description is comprehensive and includes a detailed description, impact, vulnerability rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a step-by-step security test case.
    *   **are only theoretical, e.g. missing evidence of exploit in source code analysis:** No, the source code analysis clearly points to the line of code disabling Docker Content Trust, and the security test case demonstrates how this can be exploited.
    *   **are not high or critical severity:** Yes, this vulnerability is ranked as **Medium** severity. According to the exclusion criteria, vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity should be excluded.

**Conclusion:**

Although the "Docker Content Trust Disabled" vulnerability is valid, part of the attack vector, and well-described, it is ranked as **Medium** severity.  As per the instructions to exclude vulnerabilities that are "not high or critical severity", this vulnerability should be excluded from the updated list.

Therefore, based on the provided instructions, the updated list of vulnerabilities should be empty.
