### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure JDBC Credentials in Spark Configuration
- Description:
    - An attacker could submit a pull request that modifies the documentation example in `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md` (Example 1) to directly embed plaintext JDBC credentials (username and password) within the `spark-submit` parameters of the `Spark-Python-in-s3-hms-jdbc.json` request example.
    - If this pull request is merged, users who copy and paste this example into their EMR on EKS deployments would be exposing their database credentials in plaintext within their Spark job configurations.
    - This would allow anyone with access to the job definition or logs to retrieve the database credentials.
- Impact:
    - High: Exposure of database credentials could lead to unauthorized access to the Hive Metastore database, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete metadata, and potentially gain access to the underlying data lake.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The example in the documentation directly shows insecure credential handling.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The documentation should be updated to strongly discourage embedding plaintext credentials in Spark configurations.
    - The documentation should recommend secure alternatives for managing database credentials, such as:
        - Using AWS Secrets Manager and retrieving credentials at runtime (as demonstrated in `/code/content/security/docs/spark/secrets.md`).
        - Using environment variables populated from Kubernetes secrets.
        - Emphasizing the principle of least privilege for database access.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to submit a pull request that is merged by a project maintainer.
    - Users need to copy and paste the vulnerable example from the documentation and use it in their EMR on EKS deployments without implementing proper credential management.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md`
    - The following code snippet within the documentation example demonstrates the vulnerability:
    ```markdown
    **Request:**

    ```

    - The `sparkSubmitParameters` section directly includes `--conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=<connection-user-name>` and `--conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=<connection-password>`, which are placeholders intended to be replaced with actual credentials, but the example doesn't sufficiently warn against using plaintext here.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify the file `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md`.
    3. In the "Example 1" request section, change the NOTE block to explicitly state: "**WARNING**: Do not embed actual database credentials directly in the `spark-submit` parameters as shown below. This is highly insecure and only for demonstration purposes. Always use secure methods like AWS Secrets Manager for production environments."
    4. Submit a pull request with this change.
    5. If the pull request is merged, the documentation will now contain a clearer warning against insecure credential handling, mitigating the vulnerability.
    6. To further test, a separate pull request could be created that *removes* this warning to demonstrate how easily the vulnerability could be reintroduced if vigilance is not maintained.

- Vulnerability Name: Potentially Insecure Default Image Pull Policy
- Description:
    - An attacker could submit a pull request suggesting to change the default image pull policy in documentation (e.g., in `/code/content/scalability/docs/load-test-for-start-job-run-api.md` Appendix D) from `Always` to `IfNotPresent` without adequately emphasizing the security implications.
    - If this pull request is merged, users following this "best practice" for performance optimization might inadvertently use `IfNotPresent` in security-sensitive environments, potentially leading to the use of outdated or compromised container images if image tags are reused.
- Impact:
    - Medium: Using `IfNotPresent` image pull policy can lead to running outdated or potentially vulnerable images if image tags are reused without proper version control and security scanning of container images.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation `/code/content/scalability/docs/load-test-for-start-job-run-api.md` Appendix D describes `Always` as default and lists pros and cons of `Always` and `IfNotPresent`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The documentation should be updated to include a stronger security warning against using `IfNotPresent` in production environments, especially when image tag immutability is not strictly enforced and container image security scanning pipelines are not in place.
    - It should emphasize that `Always` is the more secure default for production and that `IfNotPresent` should only be considered in specific, well-understood scenarios where performance is critical and image security is managed through other mechanisms.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to submit a pull request that is merged by a project maintainer.
    - Users need to follow the potentially misleading performance optimization advice without fully understanding the security trade-offs.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/content/scalability/docs/load-test-for-start-job-run-api.md`
    - Appendix D discusses Image Pull Policies and their pros and cons, but it lacks a strong security recommendation against `IfNotPresent` in general production scenarios:
    ```markdown
    #### ImagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

    Advantages:

    * Faster deployments: IfNotPresent can lead to faster deployments, as the image is only pulled if it's not already present in the node's cache.
    * Reduced network traffic: By only pulling the image when it's not present, you can reduce network traffic and save on data transfer costs.
    * Improved performance: IfNotPresent can improve performance, as the image is cached on the node, reducing the need for subsequent pulls.

    Disadvantages:

    * Inconsistent behavior: With IfNotPresent, nodes may have different versions of the image, leading to inconsistent behavior across deployments.
    * More complex management: IfNotPresent requires more complex management, as you need to ensure that the image is properly cached and updated.
    * Potential for outdated images: If an image is not properly updated, nodes may end up with outdated versions, leading to potential issues.
    ```
    - The "Disadvantages" section mentions "Potential for outdated images," but it doesn't explicitly highlight the security risk associated with running outdated or potentially compromised images.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify the file `/code/content/scalability/docs/load-test-for-start-job-run-api.md`.
    3. In Appendix D, add a strong warning after the "IfNotPresent" section: "**Security Warning**: While `IfNotPresent` can improve performance, it introduces significant security risks in production environments if not managed carefully. Reusing image tags with `IfNotPresent` can lead to running outdated and potentially vulnerable images without Kubernetes pulling the latest versions. For production deployments, it is strongly recommended to use `Always` image pull policy to ensure you are always running the intended image version, or implement robust image tag immutability and vulnerability scanning pipelines if using `IfNotPresent`."
    4. Submit a pull request with this change.
    5. If the pull request is merged, the documentation will now contain a clearer security warning, mitigating the vulnerability by educating users about the risks of `IfNotPresent`.
    6. To further test, a separate pull request could be created to weaken or remove this warning, demonstrating the ease of reintroducing the vulnerability without careful review.

- Vulnerability Name: Missing Security Considerations for Custom Spark Images
- Description:
    - An attacker could submit a pull request that adds or modifies documentation related to custom Docker images (e.g., in `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/multi-arch-image.md` or `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md`) without adequately emphasizing the critical security considerations for building and using custom images.
    - If merged, users might follow these guides and create custom images without properly addressing security best practices, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into their EMR on EKS environments.
    - This could include using outdated base images, including vulnerable dependencies, or failing to implement proper image scanning and vulnerability management.
- Impact:
    - Medium: Insecurely built custom Docker images can introduce a wide range of vulnerabilities, including known software vulnerabilities, malware, and misconfigurations, potentially leading to container breakouts, data breaches, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/multi-arch-image.md` and `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md` provide instructions on building and using custom images, but they lack detailed security guidance.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The documentation sections on custom Docker images should be significantly expanded to include comprehensive security best practices, such as:
        - **Using minimal base images:** Recommend using distroless or minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.
        - **Regularly updating base images:** Emphasize the importance of keeping base images up-to-date with security patches.
        - **Vulnerability scanning:** Strongly recommend implementing automated vulnerability scanning for custom images as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
        - **Dependency management:** Advise on using dependency management tools to track and update dependencies and avoid including unnecessary or vulnerable libraries.
        - **Least privilege:** Recommend running containers as non-root users and applying least privilege principles to container configurations and runtime settings.
        - **Image signing and verification:** Suggest signing container images and verifying signatures to ensure image integrity and provenance.
        - **Regular security audits:** Recommend periodic security audits of custom image build processes and configurations.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to submit a pull request that is merged by a project maintainer.
    - Users need to follow the documentation and build custom images without being fully aware of the security implications and best practices.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Files: `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/multi-arch-image.md`, `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md`
    - These files provide instructions and examples for building custom Docker images but lack sufficient security guidance. For example, in `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/multi-arch-image.md`, the Dockerfile examples are functional but do not include any security hardening steps or warnings about insecure image building practices.
    - The documentation focuses on the *how* of custom image creation but not the *securely* of custom image creation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify the file `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/multi-arch-image.md`.
    3. Add a new section titled "**Security Best Practices for Custom Docker Images**" and include detailed guidance on all the missing mitigations listed above (minimal base images, vulnerability scanning, dependency management, least privilege, image signing, security audits).
    4. In the existing Dockerfile examples, add comments highlighting security considerations and referencing the new "Security Best Practices" section.
    5. Submit a pull request with these changes.
    6. If the pull request is merged, the documentation will now provide more comprehensive security guidance, mitigating the vulnerability by educating users on secure custom image building practices.
    7. To further test, a separate pull request could be created to remove or weaken these security best practices, demonstrating how easily the vulnerability could be reintroduced if security review is not thorough.
