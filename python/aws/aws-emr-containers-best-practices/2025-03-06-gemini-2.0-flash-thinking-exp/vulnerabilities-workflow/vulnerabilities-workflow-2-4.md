### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Configuration Guidance
- Description: An attacker could submit a malicious pull request to subtly alter the documentation, recommending insecure configurations for Amazon EMR on EKS clusters. This could mislead users into deploying clusters with weakened security postures by following the compromised best practices guide. For example, an attacker might modify the security group recommendations to open up unnecessary ports or suggest disabling encryption features, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- Impact: Users following the modified documentation may unknowingly deploy insecure Amazon EMR on EKS clusters. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to cluster resources and data.
    - Data breaches due to weakened encryption or exposed services.
    - Compromise of applications running on the cluster.
    - Compliance violations due to insecure configurations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project uses pull requests for contributions, requiring review and merge by repository administrators ([/code/README.md](code/README.md), [/code/CONTRIBUTING.md](code/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
    - The project has a Code of Conduct and Contributing Guidelines ([/code/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](code/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [/code/CONTRIBUTING.md](code/CONTRIBUTING.md)) which implicitly encourages responsible contributions.
    - The `CONTRIBUTING.md` explicitly states "Security issue notifications": "If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page. Please do **not** create a public github issue." This encourages responsible disclosure of security issues.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - There is no explicit security review process for pull requests, especially focusing on configuration recommendations within the documentation.
    - No automated checks or tests to validate the security posture of configurations recommended in the documentation.
    - No specific guidelines for reviewers on how to assess the security implications of documentation changes.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to successfully submit and have a malicious pull request merged by a repository administrator. This assumes that the attacker can create a GitHub account and fork the repository, and that the repository administrators may not thoroughly review all aspects of every pull request, especially subtle changes in configuration recommendations within lengthy documentation.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not in the source code of an application, but rather in the content of documentation files written in Markdown format across the entire `/code/content/` directory.
    - An attacker can modify any documentation file, e.g., within `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md`, to suggest weaker security group rules.
    - For example, within `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md`, an attacker could modify the "Security Group" section to advise opening up a wide range of ports or using overly permissive security group rules, under the guise of simplifying configuration or improving performance.
    - Another example, in `/code/content/security/docs/spark/encryption.md`, attacker could modify the "Encryption for data at-rest" section to discourage enabling default encryption for S3 buckets or EBS volumes, or suggest using less secure encryption methods.
    - The `mkdocs.yml` file defines the structure and navigation of the documentation website. A malicious actor could also subtly modify this file to misrepresent or downplay security-related documentation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify a documentation file, for example, `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md`.
    3. In the "Define SecurityGroupPolicy" section, change the example SecurityGroupPolicy to include an overly permissive rule, such as allowing inbound traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` on all ports.
    4. Create a pull request with this change.
    5. If the pull request is merged by a repository administrator (without detecting the malicious change), the live documentation website will be updated with the insecure configuration guidance.
    6. An unsuspecting user following the updated documentation might create a `SecurityGroupPolicy` based on the malicious example, resulting in an EMR on EKS cluster with overly permissive network access.
    7. This can be verified by manually inspecting the updated documentation on the live website after the malicious pull request is merged and deployed.
