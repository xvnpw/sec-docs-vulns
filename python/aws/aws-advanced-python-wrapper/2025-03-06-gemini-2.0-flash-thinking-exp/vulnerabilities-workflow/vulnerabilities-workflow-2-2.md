## Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: **IAM Authentication Bypass via Token Manipulation**
- Description:
    - An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate the IAM authentication token generated by the IAM Authentication Plugin.
    - If the token handling mechanism in the plugin is flawed or lacks sufficient security measures (e.g., improper encryption, insecure storage, or predictable token generation), an attacker might be able to forge a valid token.
    - By using a manipulated or forged token, an attacker could bypass the IAM authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the AWS Aurora or RDS database.
- Impact:
    - High: Unauthorized database access, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project relies on AWS IAM's token generation and validation mechanisms, which are inherently secure.
    - Tokens are intended to be short-lived, limiting the window of opportunity for exploitation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Token Encryption in Transit and at Rest:** The description does not explicitly mention encryption of IAM tokens during transmission or in any local cache. If tokens are not encrypted, interception becomes easier.
    - **Token Validation Robustness:** Lack of detail on how rigorously the plugin validates tokens. Insufficient validation logic could allow manipulated tokens to pass checks.
    - **Secure Token Handling in Code:**  No specific details on secure coding practices within the plugin to prevent accidental exposure or logging of tokens.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or access systems where tokens might be temporarily stored or logged (e.g., application logs, memory dumps if not handled securely).
    - Vulnerable implementation of IAM Authentication Plugin with flaws in token handling or validation.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/docs/using-the-python-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheIamAuthenticationPlugin.md**
        - This documentation describes the IAM Authentication Plugin and its parameters (`iam_default_port`, `iam_host`, `iam_region`, `iam_expiration`).
        - It mentions that the plugin generates a temporary AWS IAM token for authentication.
        - **No source code provided to analyze the token generation, handling, or validation logic.**  Without the actual Python code of the `IamAuthPlugin` (e.g., `IamAuthPlugin.py`), it's impossible to concretely analyze the token handling mechanisms for vulnerabilities. We can only highlight the *potential* risks based on the description and general security best practices.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Set up an AWS Aurora or RDS database instance with IAM Authentication enabled.
    - Step 2: Configure the AWS Advanced Python Driver to use the IAM Authentication Plugin to connect to the database.
    - Step 3: Using a network interception tool (like Wireshark or tcpdump) or by examining application logs (if detailed token logging is mistakenly enabled), attempt to capture a valid IAM authentication token during the connection establishment phase.
    - Step 4: Modify the captured IAM token by altering characters within the token string (e.g., changing a character, swapping characters, or truncating the token).
    - Step 5: Attempt to connect to the database again using the AWS Advanced Python Driver, but this time, programmatically inject the modified IAM token into the connection process, bypassing the standard plugin flow (this might require code modification or using a debugging tool to alter variables).
    - Step 6: Check if the connection succeeds and if unauthorized database access is granted using the manipulated token.
    - Step 7: If the connection is successful, this demonstrates a vulnerability where token manipulation can bypass authentication.

- Vulnerability Name: **Federated Authentication Plugin Vulnerabilities**
- Description:
    - Similar to the IAM Authentication Plugin, the Federated Authentication Plugin, especially the Okta and ADFS implementations, introduces complexity in handling authentication tokens and assertions.
    - Vulnerabilities could arise from:
        - **Insecure Storage or Handling of Federated Credentials:** If the username, password, or SAML assertions used for federated authentication are not handled securely (e.g., logged, stored insecurely, transmitted without TLS where applicable for portions handled by the wrapper), they could be compromised.
        - **Assertion Validation Bypass:** Flaws in how the plugin validates SAML assertions received from the Identity Provider (IdP) could allow attackers to forge assertions and gain unauthorized access.
        - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** If communication between the driver and the IdP or between the driver and AWS STS (Security Token Service) is not properly secured (e.g., missing TLS/SSL certificate validation or using weak encryption), attackers might intercept credentials or tokens.
- Impact:
    - High: Bypass of federated authentication, leading to unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential data manipulation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Relies on the security of Okta and ADFS for initial authentication and AWS IAM for database access control.
    - Suggestion in documentation to use SSL_SECURE.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Credential Handling:** Explicit documentation and code review to ensure no logging or insecure storage of federated authentication credentials or SAML assertions.
    - **Robust Assertion Validation:** Detailed description and code analysis of SAML assertion validation logic to confirm it's secure against common bypass techniques (signature validation, replay attacks, etc.).
    - **Strict TLS/SSL Enforcement:**  Mandatory TLS/SSL for all communication related to federated authentication, including communication with the IdP and AWS STS. Clear guidance and enforcement against disabling SSL verification.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the application and the IdP or AWS STS, or compromise systems where credentials or assertions might be exposed.
    - Vulnerabilities in the Federated Authentication Plugin's implementation, especially in credential handling or assertion validation.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/docs/using-the-python-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheOktaAuthenticationPlugin.md**
        - Describes Okta authentication support and parameters like `idp_username`, `idp_password`, `idp_endpoint`, `iam_role_arn`, `iam_idp_arn`, `ssl_secure`.
        - Highlights the need for AWS IAM database authentication and configuring Okta as the IdP.
    - **File: /code/docs/using-the-python-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFederatedAuthenticationPlugin.md**
        - Describes Federated Authentication Plugin and parameters like `idp_username`, `idp_password`, `idp_endpoint`, `iam_role_arn`, `iam_idp_arn`, `ssl_secure`.
        - Mentions support for Microsoft AD FS.
    - **No source code provided to analyze the credential handling and SAML assertion validation logic.**  Similar to the IAM plugin, without code access, only potential risks can be highlighted. The documentation hints at parameters that control security (like `ssl_secure`), but the robustness of implementation needs code review.

- Security Test Case for Okta/ADFS Plugin:
    - Step 1: Set up an AWS Aurora or RDS database instance with IAM Authentication and Federated Authentication via Okta/ADFS.
    - Step 2: Configure the AWS Advanced Python Driver to use the Okta/ADFS Authentication Plugin, capturing network requests during authentication.
    - Step 3: In a separate attempt, replay the captured SAML assertion (obtained from network capture or logs if inadvertently exposed) to attempt direct authentication without providing valid Okta/ADFS credentials.
    - Step 4: Attempt a Man-in-the-Middle attack:
        - For Okta: If `ssl_secure` can be disabled (or is not enforced), intercept the communication between the driver and Okta IdP. Try to downgrade to HTTP or present a forged SSL certificate to intercept the session token or SAML assertion.
        - For ADFS: If `ssl_secure` is disabled or not properly validated, attempt to intercept the SAML assertion during the redirect from ADFS to the application.
    - Step 5: If authentication bypass or credential/token interception is successful in any of these steps, it indicates a vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: **Potential Connection String Parameter Injection**
- Description:
    - The `AwsWrapperConnection.connect` method accepts connection parameters through both connection strings and keyword arguments, and mentions that "keyword argument takes precedence".
    - If an application constructs connection strings dynamically (e.g., based on user input or external configuration), and if keyword arguments are also used, there's a risk of parameter injection.
    - An attacker might be able to manipulate dynamically constructed connection strings to inject malicious parameters that are then overridden by seemingly safe keyword arguments, potentially bypassing security settings or altering connection behavior in unintended ways.
- Impact:
    - Medium: Potential for bypassing intended connection security settings or manipulating connection behavior, possibly leading to unauthorized access or other unintended consequences.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly mentioned in the provided documentation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Emphasize the importance of validating and sanitizing any user-controlled input that contributes to connection string construction.
    - **Documentation Warning:** Clearly document the precedence of keyword arguments over connection string parameters and the potential security risks if connection strings are dynamically constructed without proper input validation.
    - **Best Practices Guidance:** Recommend using keyword arguments for sensitive parameters or when constructing connections dynamically to minimize injection risks.
- Preconditions:
    - Application dynamically constructs connection strings using potentially untrusted input.
    - Application also uses keyword arguments in `AwsWrapperConnection.connect`.
    - Attacker can influence the content of the dynamically constructed connection string.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/README.md**
        - Example code snippets in the "Getting Started" section show usage of both connection strings and keyword arguments.
        - It explicitly states: "**NOTE**: If the same configuration is specified in both the connection string and the keyword arguments, the keyword argument takes precedence."
    - **File: /code/docs/GettingStarted.md**
        -  Provides examples showing configuration using connection strings, keyword arguments, and a mixture of both, reinforcing the flexibility but implicitly highlighting the precedence rule.
    - **No source code for `AwsWrapperConnection.connect` is provided to analyze the parameter parsing logic.** Without the code, it's difficult to assess the exact mechanism and potential for injection. However, the documentation itself points to a potential area of concern if applications are not careful with dynamic connection string construction.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Set up a test application using `AwsWrapperConnection.connect` and configure it to accept part of the connection string from user input (e.g., a parameter for the database name). Use keyword arguments to set what are intended to be "safe" parameters, like plugins="failover".
    - Step 2: As an attacker, craft a malicious connection string input that includes a parameter that could override a security-sensitive setting, for example, inject "plugins=dev" into the connection string.
    - Step 3: Observe if the injected parameter from the connection string (e.g., "plugins=dev") takes precedence over the keyword argument (e.g., plugins="failover").
    - Step 4: If the "dev" plugin (or any other malicious or unintended plugin) gets loaded, even though the keyword argument intended "failover", it confirms the parameter injection vulnerability.
