## Combined Vulnerability List

### Potential IAM Authentication Bypass or Token Handling Vulnerability

- Description:
  - An attacker might attempt to bypass the IAM Authentication Plugin to gain unauthorized access to the database. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the IAM token generation, validation, or handling process within the plugin, or by manipulating the IAM authentication token.
  - Step-by-step scenario:
    1. An attacker identifies that the AWS Advanced Python Driver with IAM Authentication Plugin is being used to access an Amazon Aurora database.
    2. The attacker attempts to connect to the database instance, trying to intercept or manipulate the IAM token exchange process.
    3. The attacker exploits a flaw in the IAM Authentication Plugin's code, such as insecure token generation, improper validation, token leakage, improper encryption, insecure storage, or predictable token generation, to bypass the IAM authentication mechanism. Alternatively, the attacker attempts to forge a valid token.
    4. If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the database without proper IAM credentials, or by using a manipulated or forged token.
- Impact:
  - Unauthorized database access: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass IAM authentication and gain complete control over the database.
  - Data breach: An attacker with unauthorized database access could read, modify, or delete sensitive data, leading to a data breach.
  - Compromised data integrity and availability: Unauthorized modifications or deletions can compromise the integrity and availability of the database.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - The project relies on AWS IAM for authentication, which is a robust and secure authentication mechanism provided by AWS.
  - The IAM Authentication Plugin itself handles the IAM token generation and authentication process, aiming to simplify secure access for users.
  - Tokens are intended to be short-lived, limiting the window of opportunity for exploitation.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization: Missing specific input validation within the IAM plugin code to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior during token processing.
  - Robust token validation: Ensure that the IAM token validation process is comprehensive and resistant to bypass attempts. Detailed code review is needed to confirm the robustness.
  - Secure token handling: Verify that IAM tokens are handled securely in memory and during transmission, minimizing the risk of leakage or interception. Detailed code review is needed to confirm secure handling.
  - Rate limiting and throttling: Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks or excessive attempts to bypass authentication.
  - Token Encryption in Transit and at Rest: Ensure encryption of IAM tokens during transmission and in any local cache.
  - Secure Token Handling in Code: Implement secure coding practices within the plugin to prevent accidental exposure or logging of tokens.
- Preconditions:
  - The AWS Advanced Python Driver is used to connect to an Amazon Aurora database.
  - The IAM Authentication Plugin is enabled for the database connection.
  - A vulnerability exists in the IAM Authentication Plugin related to IAM token handling or validation.
  - Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or access systems where tokens might be temporarily stored or logged.
- Source code analysis:
  - Detailed source code analysis of the `aws_advanced_python_wrapper/iam_plugin.py` is needed to identify specific vulnerabilities.
  - Look for code sections that handle IAM token generation, validation, and transmission.
  - Analyze the code for potential weaknesses such as:
    - Lack of input validation on user-supplied parameters that influence token generation.
    - Insecure cryptographic practices in token generation or validation.
    - Potential for token leakage through logging, insecure storage, or insecure transmission.
    - Missing checks for token expiration or tampering.
  - **Note:** Without access to the source code of `aws_advanced_python_wrapper/iam_plugin.py`, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. This section is a placeholder for future analysis.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Setup:
    - Deploy an Amazon Aurora database instance with IAM authentication enabled.
    - Configure the AWS Advanced Python Driver to connect to the Aurora database using the IAM Authentication Plugin.
    - Ensure that IAM authentication is correctly configured and enforced.
  - Step 2: Attempt unauthorized access:
    - As an external attacker, try to connect to the Aurora database instance using the AWS Advanced Python Driver with the IAM Authentication Plugin enabled, but without providing valid IAM credentials.
    - Attempt to bypass IAM authentication by manipulating connection parameters or injecting malicious payloads into connection requests.
    - Try to replay or modify captured IAM tokens to gain unauthorized access.
    - Attempt to capture a valid IAM authentication token and modify it, then try to connect using the modified token.
  - Step 3: Expected result:
    - The connection attempts from the attacker should be consistently rejected by the IAM Authentication Plugin.
    - The attacker should not be able to bypass IAM authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database.
  - Step 4: Success condition:
    - The security test case is considered successful if the attacker fails to bypass IAM authentication and gain unauthorized access in all attempted scenarios, demonstrating the plugin's resistance to bypass attempts.

### Federated Authentication Plugin Vulnerabilities

- Description:
  - Similar to the IAM Authentication Plugin, the Federated Authentication Plugin, especially the Okta and ADFS implementations, introduces complexity in handling authentication tokens and assertions.
  - Vulnerabilities could arise from:
    - **Insecure Storage or Handling of Federated Credentials:** If the username, password, or SAML assertions used for federated authentication are not handled securely (e.g., logged, stored insecurely, transmitted without TLS where applicable for portions handled by the wrapper), they could be compromised.
    - **Assertion Validation Bypass:** Flaws in how the plugin validates SAML assertions received from the Identity Provider (IdP) could allow attackers to forge assertions and gain unauthorized access.
    - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** If communication between the driver and the IdP or between the driver and AWS STS (Security Token Service) is not properly secured (e.g., missing TLS/SSL certificate validation or using weak encryption), attackers might intercept credentials or tokens.
- Impact:
  - High: Bypass of federated authentication, leading to unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential data manipulation.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - Relies on the security of Okta and ADFS for initial authentication and AWS IAM for database access control.
  - Suggestion in documentation to use SSL_SECURE.
- Missing mitigations:
  - **Secure Credential Handling:** Explicit documentation and code review to ensure no logging or insecure storage of federated authentication credentials or SAML assertions.
  - **Robust Assertion Validation:** Detailed description and code analysis of SAML assertion validation logic to confirm it's secure against common bypass techniques (signature validation, replay attacks, etc.).
  - **Strict TLS/SSL Enforcement:**  Mandatory TLS/SSL for all communication related to federated authentication, including communication with the IdP and AWS STS. Clear guidance and enforcement against disabling SSL verification.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the application and the IdP or AWS STS, or compromise systems where credentials or assertions might be exposed.
  - Vulnerabilities in the Federated Authentication Plugin's implementation, especially in credential handling or assertion validation.
- Source code analysis:
  - **File: /code/docs/using-the-python-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheOktaAuthenticationPlugin.md** and **File: /code/docs/using-the-python-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFederatedAuthenticationPlugin.md** describe the plugins and their parameters.
  - **No source code provided to analyze the credential handling and SAML assertion validation logic.**  Similar to the IAM plugin, without code access, only potential risks can be highlighted.
- Security test case for Okta/ADFS Plugin:
  - Step 1: Set up an AWS Aurora or RDS database instance with IAM Authentication and Federated Authentication via Okta/ADFS.
  - Step 2: Configure the AWS Advanced Python Driver to use the Okta/ADFS Authentication Plugin, capturing network requests during authentication.
  - Step 3: Replay Attack: Replay the captured SAML assertion to attempt direct authentication without providing valid Okta/ADFS credentials.
  - Step 4: Man-in-the-Middle attack:
    - If `ssl_secure` can be disabled (or is not enforced), intercept the communication between the driver and Okta/ADFS IdP. Try to downgrade to HTTP or present a forged SSL certificate to intercept the session token or SAML assertion.
  - Step 5: If authentication bypass or credential/token interception is successful in any of these steps, it indicates a vulnerability.

### IAM Authentication Plugin Misconfiguration leading to Unauthorized Database Access

- Description:
  - An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database by exploiting misconfigurations in the application code that uses the IAM Authentication Plugin, specifically overly permissive IAM roles or policies.
  - Step 1: An application using the AWS Advanced Python Driver with IAM Authentication Plugin is configured with an overly permissive IAM role or policy, granting broader RDS data API access than necessary.
  - Step 2: An attacker gains control or access to the application's configuration or execution environment.
  - Step 3: The attacker leverages the application's misconfigured IAM role or policy to execute database operations beyond the intended scope, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data, or performing administrative actions without proper authorization.
- Impact:
  - Critical. Unauthorized database access can lead to severe data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of the entire database system.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - The AWS Advanced Python Driver itself does not implement mitigations for IAM policy or role misconfigurations, as this is outside the scope of the driver and within the responsibility of the application developer and AWS IAM administrator.
- Missing mitigations:
  - **Least Privilege IAM Policies Documentation:**  The project documentation should include a strong warning and best practices guide on implementing least privilege IAM policies and roles for database access when using the IAM Authentication Plugin.
- Preconditions:
  - The target application must be using the AWS Advanced Python Driver with the IAM Authentication Plugin enabled.
  - The application's IAM role or associated IAM policies must be misconfigured to grant excessive database permissions.
  - The attacker must gain some level of access to the application's environment or configuration to leverage the misconfiguration.
- Source code analysis:
  - The `aws_advanced_python_wrapper/iam_plugin.py` implements the IAM Authentication Plugin.
  - The vulnerability arises from how the application *configures* IAM roles and policies, not from the driver's code itself.
  - The driver correctly uses the provided IAM credentials to authenticate, but it cannot enforce least privilege policies.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Setup: Create `PermissiveRole` with broad `rds-data:*` permissions and `LeastPrivilegeRole` with minimal `rds-data:ExecuteStatement` permission. Deploy two applications, `PermissiveApp.py` using `PermissiveRole` and `LeastPrivilegeApp.py` using `LeastPrivilegeRole`.
  - Step 2: Exploit: Gain access to `PermissiveApp.py`'s environment and inject code to execute an unauthorized query (e.g., `CREATE USER attacker_user`).
  - Step 3: Verification: Run modified `PermissiveApp.py` and verify the unauthorized query executes. Run `LeastPrivilegeApp.py` with the same modified code and verify the query fails.

### Secrets Manager Plugin Misconfiguration leading to Credential Exposure

- Description:
  - An attacker can cause the application to connect to an attacker-controlled database or expose credentials by exploiting misconfigurations in the Secrets Manager Plugin settings, specifically by manipulating the `secrets_manager_secret_id`.
  - Step 1: An attacker gains access to the application's configuration.
  - Step 2: The attacker modifies the `secrets_manager_secret_id` parameter to point to a secret under the attacker's control.
  - Step 3: The application fetches credentials using the modified `secrets_manager_secret_id`.
  - Step 4: The application uses attacker-provided credentials, potentially connecting to an attacker's database or using malicious credentials on the legitimate database.
- Impact:
  - Critical. Unauthorized access to the database. Exposure of sensitive data. Potential data corruption or manipulation.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The library itself does not prevent misconfiguration at the application level.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Documentation should strongly emphasize secure configuration practices, highlighting the risks of misconfiguration.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker must gain access to the application's configuration.
  - Application must be configured to use the AWS Secrets Manager Plugin.
- Source code analysis:
  - The vulnerability is in the `AwsSecretsManagerPlugin` in `aws_advanced_python_wrapper/aws_secrets_manager_plugin.py`.
  - The `connect` method fetches the secret using the provided `secrets_manager_secret_id` without validation of its source or ownership.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Setup: Deploy application with Secrets Manager Plugin. Create legitimate and malicious Secrets Manager secrets. Configure application to use legitimate secret.
  - Step 2: Exploit: Access application configuration and modify `secrets_manager_secret_id` to point to the malicious secret.
  - Step 3: Verification: Restart application and observe connection attempts. Verify application connects to attacker-controlled database or uses attacker-provided credentials.

### IAM Authentication Plugin Misconfiguration leading to Credential Exposure

- Description:
  - An attacker can cause the application to use an attacker-controlled IAM role by exploiting misconfigurations in the IAM Authentication Plugin settings, specifically by manipulating the `profile_name`.
  - Step 1: An attacker gains access to the application's configuration.
  - Step 2: The attacker modifies the `profile_name` parameter to point to an IAM profile under the attacker's control.
  - Step 3: The application uses AWS credentials from attacker's IAM profile to authenticate to the database.
  - Step 4: The application gains unintended access to the database using attacker's IAM role, potentially with elevated privileges.
- Impact:
  - High. Unauthorized database access using attacker-controlled IAM role. Potential for privilege escalation.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The library itself does not prevent misconfiguration at the application level.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Documentation should strongly emphasize secure configuration practices, highlighting the risks of misconfiguration.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker must gain access to the application's configuration.
  - Application must be configured to use the IAM Authentication Plugin.
- Source code analysis:
  - The vulnerability is in the `IamAuthPlugin` in `aws_advanced_python_wrapper/iam_plugin.py`.
  - The `connect` method uses `profile_name` from properties to load AWS configuration without validating its source.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Setup: Deploy application with IAM Authentication Plugin. Create legitimate (`legitimate_profile`) and malicious (`attacker_profile`) IAM profiles. Configure application to use `legitimate_profile`.
  - Step 2: Exploit: Access application configuration and modify `profile_name` to `attacker_profile`.
  - Step 3: Verification: Restart application. Verify application is using permissions of `attacker_profile` instead of `legitimate_profile`, allowing for potentially unauthorized actions.
