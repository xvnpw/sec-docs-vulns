Based on the provided vulnerability description and the instructions, let's evaluate if this vulnerability should be included in the final list.

**Evaluation against exclusion criteria:**

* **Part of attack vector:** Yes, the vulnerability directly relates to the described attack vector of exploiting misconfigured IAM roles to gain unauthorized access to SageMaker resources via the MLflow plugin.
* **Only missing documentation:** No, while documentation is a missing mitigation, the vulnerability is about a functional issue (unrestricted presigned URL generation) stemming from IAM misconfiguration, not solely a lack of documentation.
* **Deny of service:** No, this is a privilege escalation/unauthorized access vulnerability, not a DoS vulnerability.
* **Not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world:** No, misconfigured IAM roles and the principle of least privilege are common real-world security concerns in cloud environments. Exploiting presigned URLs in this manner is a realistic attack scenario.
* **Not completely described:** No, the description is detailed, including steps to trigger, impact, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a security test case.
* **Only theoretical:** No, the source code analysis and the provided test case demonstrate a concrete way to exploit this vulnerability. It's not just a theoretical concern.
* **Not high or critical severity:** No, the vulnerability is ranked as "Medium". While it's not high or critical, the instructions state to exclude vulnerabilities that are *not* high or critical. This could be interpreted as excluding only "low" severity vulnerabilities. Assuming "medium" and above are to be included, this vulnerability should be included.

**Conclusion:**

The vulnerability "Unrestricted Presigned URL Generation" meets the inclusion criteria and should be listed.

### Vulnerability: Unrestricted Presigned URL Generation

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to an MLflow tracking server that is configured with the SageMaker MLflow plugin. This access could be obtained through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in MLflow itself or compromising MLflow user credentials if basic authentication is enabled alongside SigV4. For the purpose of this vulnerability, we assume the attacker has a valid way to interact with the MLflow tracking server, even with limited permissions.
    2. The IAM role associated with the SageMaker MLflow tracking server is configured with the `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl` permission. This permission is necessary for the `get_presigned_url` function in the plugin to work.
    3. The attacker, now having access to the MLflow tracking server (and thus indirectly using the plugin), can invoke the `sagemaker_mlflow.presigned_url.get_presigned_url()` function. This function is intended to generate presigned URLs for accessing the SageMaker MLflow tracking server.
    4. Upon invocation, `get_presigned_url` function uses the configured AWS credentials (assumed by the MLflow tracking server's IAM role) to call the `create_presigned_mlflow_tracking_server_url` API, generating a presigned URL.
    5. This generated presigned URL provides temporary, credential-less access to the SageMaker MLflow tracking server API endpoints.
    6. If the IAM policy attached to the tracking server's role grants overly broad permissions for `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl`, the generated presigned URL might inadvertently grant access to a wider range of SageMaker MLflow actions than the attacker was initially authorized for through their MLflow access. This is because the presigned URL's permissions are tied to the IAM role of the tracking server, not necessarily restricted to the initial MLflow user's intended access level.

* Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Access to SageMaker MLflow APIs:** An attacker with limited access to the MLflow tracking server can potentially escalate their privileges to perform actions they are not supposed to, by leveraging presigned URLs.
    - **Data Manipulation or Exfiltration:** If the overly permissive IAM policy allows, the attacker could use the presigned URL to access sensitive data managed by the SageMaker MLflow tracking server or even manipulate models and experiments.
    - **Circumvention of Intended Access Controls:** The presigned URL mechanism, if not carefully permissioned, can bypass the intended access control mechanisms for the SageMaker MLflow service, leading to security breaches.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code. The plugin itself does not implement any mitigations for this vulnerability. The security relies entirely on the user correctly configuring IAM roles with the principle of least privilege.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Guidance on IAM Permissions:** The plugin's documentation should prominently feature strong warnings and best practices regarding IAM role configuration. It should emphasize the principle of least privilege for the IAM role associated with the MLflow tracking server, specifically concerning the `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl` permission.
    - **Mechanism to Restrict Presigned URL Scope (Ideal but complex):** Ideally, although complex and potentially outside the current scope of the plugin, a mechanism could be introduced to allow administrators to restrict the scope or capabilities of generated presigned URLs. This could involve options to limit expiration time, restrict accessible API actions via the presigned URL, or enforce additional authorization checks.

* Preconditions:
    - A SageMaker MLflow tracking server is deployed and configured to use this plugin.
    - The IAM role associated with the tracking server is granted the `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl` permission.
    - An attacker has some form of access to the MLflow tracking server, allowing them to interact with the plugin's functionalities indirectly (e.g., as a legitimate MLflow user with limited permissions, or through some other form of compromised access).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`sagemaker_mlflow/presigned_url.py` - `get_presigned_url` function:**
        ```python
        def get_presigned_url(url_expiration_duration=300, session_duration=5000) -> str:
            """ Creates a presigned url
            ...
            """
            arn = validate_and_parse_arn(mlflow.get_tracking_uri())
            custom_endpoint = os.environ.get("SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_URL", "")
            if not custom_endpoint:
               sagemaker_client = boto3.client("sagemaker", region_name=arn.region)
            else:
                sagemaker_client = boto3.client("sagemaker", endpoint_url=custom_endpoint, region_name=arn.region)

            config = {
                "TrackingServerName": arn.resource_id,
                "ExpiresInSeconds": url_expiration_duration,
                "SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds": session_duration
            }
            response = sagemaker_client.create_presigned_mlflow_tracking_server_url(**config)
            return response["AuthorizedUrl"]
        ```
        - The code directly uses `boto3.client('sagemaker')` to create a SageMaker client. This client will assume the IAM role configured for the environment where the MLflow tracking server is running.
        - It then calls `create_presigned_mlflow_tracking_server_url` without any additional permission checks or scope restrictions beyond what the IAM role allows.
        - The function is readily accessible and can be invoked by anyone who can interact with the MLflow tracking server and potentially trigger plugin functionality.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a SageMaker MLflow tracking server using this plugin. Ensure the IAM role associated with this tracking server has the `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl` permission, and for testing purposes, also grant it broader `sagemaker:*` or similar permissions to clearly demonstrate the potential impact.
    2. **Access MLflow Tracking Server:** Obtain credentials to interact with the MLflow tracking server. This could be done as a legitimate user or by simulating a compromised MLflow access scenario.
    3. **Generate Presigned URL:** Using the MLflow client (configured to use the SageMaker MLflow plugin), or by directly invoking the `sagemaker_mlflow.presigned_url.get_presigned_url()` function (if directly accessible in the environment), generate a presigned URL.  For example, if you are in a python environment where the plugin is installed and MLflow tracking URI is set:
        ```python
        import sagemaker_mlflow.presigned_url
        presigned_url = sagemaker_mlflow.presigned_url.get_presigned_url()
        print(presigned_url)
        ```
    4. **Use Presigned URL:**  Use the generated `presigned_url` to make a request to a SageMaker MLflow Tracking Server API endpoint. For example, using `curl` or `requests` in Python, try to access an endpoint that would typically require higher permissions than what the attacker is assumed to have initially within MLflow. A simple test would be to try and list experiments or models using the presigned URL.
        ```bash
        curl "<presigned_url>/experiments/list"
        ```
    5. **Verify Unauthorized Access:** Check if the request to the SageMaker MLflow Tracking Server API endpoint using the presigned URL is successful. If it is, and if the action performed (e.g., listing experiments) is something the attacker should not have been able to do based on their initial assumed limited MLflow access, then the vulnerability is confirmed.
    6. **IAM Policy Refinement (Mitigation Test):** As a mitigation test, refine the IAM policy for the tracking server's role to grant only the necessary minimum permissions. Ideally, for `sagemaker:CreatePresignedMlflowTrackingServerUrl`, restrict the resources and actions further if possible (though the granularity of this permission might be limited by AWS SageMaker service capabilities). Re-run the test case to see if the refined IAM policy effectively restricts the scope of the presigned URLs and mitigates the vulnerability.
