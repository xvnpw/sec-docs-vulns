### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Unsanitized Metadata and Annotation Injection

* Description:
    1. An attacker can control data that is passed to the `put_metadata` or `put_annotation` functions of the X-Ray SDK.
    2. These functions directly add the provided data into the X-Ray trace without sanitization.
    3. If an application logs user-controlled input as metadata or annotations, a malicious user can inject arbitrary data.
    4. When these X-Ray traces are processed by downstream systems (e.g., monitoring dashboards, log analyzers), the injected malicious data can be interpreted and potentially exploited by an attacker if these systems have vulnerabilities in handling the injected data.

* Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker could inject data to exfiltrate sensitive information if the downstream systems processing X-Ray traces expose the injected metadata/annotations.
    - Log Injection/Manipulation: An attacker can manipulate logs in downstream systems by injecting arbitrary log entries or control characters, potentially leading to misinterpretation of application behavior or masking malicious activities.
    - Exploitation of Downstream Systems: If downstream systems parsing X-Ray traces have vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting in a dashboard, command injection in a log processing tool), the attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities using the injected malicious data.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any sanitization or validation for metadata or annotations.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization of data passed to `put_metadata` and `put_annotation` to prevent injection of malicious content. Consider escaping special characters or limiting the allowed characters to a safe subset.
    - Data Validation: Validate the format and content of metadata and annotations to ensure they conform to expected schemas and prevent unexpected data from being logged.
    - Documentation: Clearly document the risks of logging unsanitized user inputs as metadata and annotations and advise developers on secure coding practices to mitigate these risks.

* Preconditions:
    1. The application must use the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python to record traces.
    2. The application must log user-controlled input as metadata or annotations using `put_metadata` or `put_annotation`.
    3. The X-Ray traces must be processed by downstream systems that are potentially vulnerable to handling malicious data.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/aws_xray_sdk/core/models/entity.py`
    2. Functions of interest: `put_annotation(self, key, value)` and `put_metadata(self, key, value, namespace='default')` in the `Entity` class.

    ```python
    def put_annotation(self, key, value):
        """
        Annotate segment or subsegment with a key-value pair.
        ...
        """
        self._check_ended()

        if not isinstance(key, str):
            log.warning("ignoring non string type annotation key with type %s.", type(key))
            return

        if not isinstance(value, annotation_value_types):
            log.warning("ignoring unsupported annotation value type %s.", type(value))
            return

        if any(character not in _valid_annotation_key_characters for character in key):
            log.warning("ignoring annnotation with unsupported characters in key: '%s'.", key)
            return

        self.annotations[key] = value # Vulnerability: Directly storing value without sanitization
    ```

    ```python
    def put_metadata(self, key, value, namespace='default'):
        """
        Add metadata to segment or subsegment. ...
        """
        self._check_ended()

        if not isinstance(namespace, str):
            log.warning("ignoring non string type metadata namespace")
            return

        if namespace.startswith('AWS.'):
            log.warning("Prefix 'AWS.' is reserved, drop metadata with namespace %s", namespace)
            return

        if self.metadata.get(namespace, None):
            self.metadata[namespace][key] = value # Vulnerability: Directly storing value without sanitization
        else:
            self.metadata[namespace] = {key: value} # Vulnerability: Directly storing value without sanitization
    ```

                                                                                    | No Sanitization
    ```
    - Code Walkthrough:
        - The `put_annotation` and `put_metadata` functions in the `Entity` class (which `Segment` and `Subsegment` inherit) are responsible for adding annotations and metadata to X-Ray traces.
        - These functions perform basic checks on the key and namespace (e.g., key type, namespace prefix).
        - However, the `value` parameter, which can be user-controlled input, is directly stored in the `annotations` or `metadata` dictionaries without any sanitization or validation.
        - This means any data, including potentially malicious payloads, passed as `value` will be included in the X-Ray trace.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup a Flask application instrumented with AWS X-Ray SDK as shown in `/code/sample-apps/flask/application.py`.
    2. Modify the `/code/sample-apps/flask/application.py` to put user-controlled input into metadata.
    ```python
    @app.route('/metadata-injection')
    def metadata_injection():
        user_input = request.args.get('input')
        xray_recorder.put_metadata('user_metadata', user_input, 'user_namespace') # Log user input as metadata
        return "Metadata injected!"
    ```
    3. Deploy the Flask application.
    4. As an attacker, craft a malicious payload. For example, a simple injection string: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    5. Send a request to the `/metadata-injection` endpoint with the malicious payload as input: `http://<your-app-url>/metadata-injection?input=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    6. Check the X-Ray trace for the segment generated by this request. The metadata should contain the injected script.
    7. Assume a vulnerable downstream system (e.g., a dashboard that displays X-Ray metadata without sanitization). If this system processes the trace, the injected script could be executed (e.g., an alert box popping up in the dashboard if it's vulnerable to XSS).
    8. To further demonstrate, you can inject more harmful payloads depending on the assumed vulnerabilities of the downstream system. For log injection, you could inject control characters like newline `\n` to create fake log entries or manipulate log structure.
