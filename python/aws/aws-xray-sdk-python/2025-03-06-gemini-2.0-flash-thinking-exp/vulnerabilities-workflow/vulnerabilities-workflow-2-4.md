## Vulnerability List for AWS X-Ray SDK for Python

### 1. HTTP Header and URL Injection in Annotations

- **Description:**
    1. The AWS X-Ray SDK for Python Django middleware, when configured with `URLS_AS_ANNOTATION` set to `ALL` or `LAMBDA`, extracts values from HTTP request headers (User-Agent, X-Forwarded-For, Client-IP) and the request URL.
    2. These extracted values are then directly added as annotations to the X-Ray segment without any sanitization.
    3. An attacker can inject malicious data into HTTP headers or manipulate the URL of their requests to the instrumented Django application.
    4. The injected malicious data from the headers or URL will be recorded as annotations in the X-Ray traces.
    5. When viewing these traces in the X-Ray console or through any system accessing the trace data, the attacker-controlled data in the annotations will be displayed, potentially leading to information disclosure.

- **Impact:** Information Disclosure. Attackers can inject arbitrary data into X-Ray traces via HTTP headers and URLs, which can be viewed by anyone with access to the traces. This could expose sensitive information depending on the context and the nature of the injected data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The SDK provides configuration options to enable/disable the feature but does not sanitize the input data when `URLS_AS_ANNOTATION` is enabled.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization should be implemented in the Django middleware before adding header and URL values as annotations.
    - Alternatively, documentation should be updated to strongly discourage enabling `URLS_AS_ANNOTATION` in production environments or advise users to sanitize inputs before they reach the middleware if they choose to use this feature.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The target application must be a Django application using the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python Django middleware.
    - The Django application's settings must have `URLS_AS_ANNOTATION` configured to either `ALL` or `LAMBDA` within the `XRAY_RECORDER` settings.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/aws_xray_sdk/ext/django/middleware.py`
    - Method: `XRayMiddleware.__call__(self, request)`
    - Vulnerable code snippet:
    ```python
            if self._urls_as_annotation():
                segment.put_annotation(http.URL, request.build_absolute_uri())
                segment.put_annotation(http.METHOD, request.method)
                if meta.get(USER_AGENT_KEY):
                    segment.put_annotation(http.USER_AGENT, meta.get(USER_AGENT_KEY))
                if meta.get(X_FORWARDED_KEY):
                    segment.put_annotation(http.CLIENT_IP, meta.get(X_FORWARDED_KEY))
                    segment.put_annotation(http.X_FORWARDED_FOR, True)
            elif meta.get(REMOTE_ADDR_KEY):
                segment.put_annotation(http.CLIENT_IP, meta.get(REMOTE_ADDR_KEY))
    ```
    - The code directly uses values from `request.build_absolute_uri()`, `request.method`, and values retrieved from `request.META` (representing HTTP headers) to populate annotations using `segment.put_annotation()`. No input sanitization is performed before adding these values as annotations.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a sample Django application using the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python and the Django middleware.
    2. Configure the Django application by setting `URLS_AS_ANNOTATION = 'ALL'` in the `XRAY_RECORDER` settings within `settings.py`.
    3. Send an HTTP GET request to any endpoint of the deployed Django application. Include a malicious payload in the `User-Agent` header, for instance: `User-Agent: <script>alert("Vulnerability")</script>`.
    4. Access the AWS X-Ray console (or any tool to view X-Ray traces for your application).
    5. Locate the trace corresponding to the HTTP request you sent in step 3.
    6. Inspect the annotations section of the segment within the trace details.
    7. Verify that the `User-Agent` annotation's value in the trace is exactly the malicious payload you injected (`<script>alert("Vulnerability")</script>`), confirming that the input was not sanitized before being recorded as an annotation.
    8. Repeat steps 3-7, injecting payloads in other headers like `X-Forwarded-For` and by modifying the URL itself to include malicious strings.
    9. Confirm that the X-Ray traces consistently record the unsanitized injected payloads in the corresponding annotations (URL, METHOD, USER_AGENT, CLIENT_IP, X-Forwarded-For).
