#### 1. Insecure Security Group Configuration - Open Port 443 to Public

* Description:
    1. The `amazonei_setup.py` script automatically creates a security group named `amazon_ei_security_group` if one with the required ports doesn't already exist.
    2. This security group is configured to allow inbound TCP traffic on port 443 (intended for Amazon Elastic Inference service communication) and port 22 (for SSH access).
    3. Critically, the script configures these inbound rules to accept traffic from `0.0.0.0/0`, which means from any IP address on the internet.
    4. While port 443 is intended for secure communication (HTTPS/TLS), opening it to the entire internet (`0.0.0.0/0`) for the Elastic Inference service might be overly permissive depending on the service's security design and potential vulnerabilities.
    5. If the Elastic Inference service or any other service running on the instance listening on port 443 has vulnerabilities, or if unauthorized access to the EI service can lead to further exploits, this broad access could be exploited by attackers from anywhere on the internet.

* Impact:
    - **Medium to High**:  The impact depends on the security posture of the Elastic Inference service itself and any other services running on the instance that might be exposed through port 443.
    - Unauthorized access to the Elastic Inference service could potentially lead to:
        - **Data exfiltration or manipulation**: If the EI service processes sensitive data.
        - **Resource abuse**: An attacker might be able to utilize the EI accelerator for their own malicious purposes, incurring costs and potentially impacting the performance for the legitimate user.
        - **Lateral movement**: If the instance hosting the EI service is not properly isolated and connected to other internal networks, an attacker might use this initial access point to pivot and explore further into the internal network.
    - Even if the EI service is inherently secure, exposing port 443 to the entire internet increases the attack surface.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: The script currently hardcodes the CIDR range to `0.0.0.0/0` in the `authorize_security_group_ingress` function within the `EC2` class in `/code/amazonei_setup.py`.
    ```python
    def authorize_security_group_ingress(self,sg_id,port):
        self._ec2_Client.authorize_security_group_ingress(GroupId=sg_id, IpProtocol="tcp",
                                                          CidrIp="0.0.0.0/0", # Insecure: Allows traffic from any IP
                                                          FromPort=port, ToPort=port)
    ```

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Restrict Inbound CIDR Range**: The most crucial missing mitigation is to allow users to specify a more restrictive CIDR range for inbound traffic on port 443 and port 22.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  The security group configuration should adhere to the principle of least privilege.  Instead of opening to `0.0.0.0/0`, the script should ideally:
        - Prompt the user to input their desired CIDR range for access, or
        - Automatically configure the security group to only allow traffic from the user's current public IP address, or
        - Provide an option to restrict access to a specific VPC or network range.
    - **Documentation**: While not a direct mitigation, better documentation explaining the security implications of opening port 443 to `0.0.0.0/0` and recommending more restrictive configurations would be beneficial.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must run the `amazonei_setup.py` script and choose to create a new security group or use an existing one that gets configured by the script.
    - The script must successfully create the security group and apply the inbound rules.
    - An EC2 instance must be launched using this security group.
    - The Elastic Inference service or another service must be running on the instance and listening on port 443.

    6. **Class:** `UserInput`
    7. **Function:** `get_security_groups(self,vpc_id,service_port)` and `create_security_group(self, group_name, description, vpc_id, service_port)` are used to either reuse existing security groups or create new ones, both using the `EC2` class functions described above, inheriting the insecure CIDR configuration.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Run the `amazonei_setup.py` script in an AWS environment.
        - Choose to create a new security group when prompted or if no suitable existing security group is found.
        - Allow the script to launch an EC2 instance with Elastic Inference.
        - Obtain the Security Group ID created by the script.
    2. **Verification (Manual):**
        - In the AWS EC2 Console, navigate to Security Groups.
        - Locate the security group created by the script (likely named `amazon_ei_security_group`).
        - Inspect the Inbound Rules for this security group.
        - **Verify**: Confirm that there are Inbound Rules for TCP port 443 and TCP port 22 with the Source set to `0.0.0.0/0`.
    3. **Verification (Automated - AWS CLI):**
        - Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security_group_id>` (replace `<security_group_id>` with the actual ID).
        - Parse the output (JSON) to check the `IpPermissions` for the security group.
        - **Verify**: Confirm that for port 443 and port 22, the `IpRanges` includes an entry like `{"CidrIp": "0.0.0.0/0"}`.
    4. **Exploit Attempt (Conceptual - Requires further EI service vulnerability):**
        - From a machine outside the AWS environment where the instance is running, attempt to connect to the public IP of the launched EC2 instance on port 443.
        - While this connection itself might be expected for accessing the EI service, this step demonstrates the public accessibility due to the `0.0.0.0/0` rule.
        - **Note**: To fully exploit this, one would need to identify a vulnerability within the Elastic Inference service or any other service listening on port 443 that could be triggered via public internet access. This test case primarily validates the overly permissive security group configuration, not a specific exploit of the EI service itself, as that would be outside the scope of this code analysis.

This vulnerability highlights a security best practice violation in the automated setup script, leading to a potentially increased attack surface for the launched EC2 instances and the Elastic Inference service.
