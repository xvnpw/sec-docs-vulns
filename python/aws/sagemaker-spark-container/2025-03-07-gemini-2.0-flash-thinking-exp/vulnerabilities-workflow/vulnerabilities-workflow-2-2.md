### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Apache Spark Version Vulnerabilities
* Description:
    1. The SageMaker Spark Container bundles a specific version of Apache Spark.
    2. This bundled Apache Spark version may contain known security vulnerabilities.
    3. An attacker can exploit these known vulnerabilities by crafting a malicious Spark job.
    4. When this malicious Spark job is submitted to the SageMaker Spark Container within Amazon SageMaker, it gets executed by the vulnerable Apache Spark instance.
    5. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the container environment during the processing of the Spark job.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the Amazon SageMaker Spark Container environment.
    - Potential unauthorized access to data and resources within the SageMaker environment, depending on the permissions of the execution role.
    - Compromise of the Spark processing workload and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project provides build scripts and configurations to build the Docker image, but there is no explicit vulnerability mitigation for the bundled Apache Spark version within the provided project files. The `new_images.yml` file suggests different Spark versions can be built, implying version management is considered, but active vulnerability patching isn't evident in the code.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Regularly update the bundled Apache Spark version:** The project should implement a process to regularly update the Apache Spark version bundled in the container to the latest stable release. This includes applying security patches released by the Apache Spark project.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning into the container build process. This would involve scanning the Docker image for known vulnerabilities in the installed packages, including Apache Spark and its dependencies. Tools like Clair, Trivy, or Anchore can be used for this purpose.
    - **Dependency Management:** Implement a clear dependency management strategy to track and manage the versions of Apache Spark and other libraries included in the container. This will facilitate easier updates and vulnerability patching.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to submit a Spark job to a SageMaker Processing or Training job that utilizes the vulnerable SageMaker Spark Container image. This typically requires access to an Amazon SageMaker environment and the ability to create and run Processing or Training jobs.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not directly expose the specific version of Apache Spark being bundled. However, files like `new_images.yml` suggest different Spark versions are supported (e.g., "spark: "3.5"").
    - The `buildspec.yml`, `buildspec_test.yml`, `scripts/build.sh` files outline the image build process. These scripts use `docker build` commands, but they do not include steps for vulnerability scanning or patching of the base OS or Apache Spark installation.
    - The vulnerability is not within the project's code itself but rather in the external dependency (Apache Spark) that is included in the Docker image.
    - There is no code in the provided files that actively mitigates known vulnerabilities in the bundled Apache Spark version. The project focuses on containerizing and running Spark, not on actively securing the Spark distribution itself beyond potentially choosing a specific version.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Identify a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a specific Apache Spark version (e.g., CVE-2022-33891 if using Spark 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.0, or CVE-2018-1284 if using older versions).
    2. Determine the exact Apache Spark version bundled in the SageMaker Spark Container image (this might require inspecting the Dockerfile or running a container and checking the Spark version). For example, based on `new_images.yml`, it could be Spark 3.5.
    3. Craft a Spark job (e.g., in Python, Scala, or Java) that is designed to exploit the identified vulnerability. For CVE-2022-33891, this might involve sending a specially crafted request to the Spark Master UI. For other vulnerabilities, it might involve manipulating job configurations or data inputs.
    4. Deploy the SageMaker Spark Container image in an Amazon SageMaker Processing Job using the SageMaker Python SDK.
    5. Submit the crafted malicious Spark job to the running SageMaker Processing Job.
    6. Monitor the Processing Job logs and the SageMaker environment to confirm if the vulnerability is successfully exploited and if arbitrary code execution occurs. For example, check for unexpected system calls, network connections, or file system modifications originating from the Spark container.
    7. If successful, this test case demonstrates the presence of the Apache Spark version vulnerability in the SageMaker Spark Container.
