### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection in User-Defined After-Restore Hooks
- Description:
    - Step 1: A developer uses the `snapshot-restore-py` library to register an `after_restore` hook in their AWS Lambda function.
    - Step 2: Within the `after_restore` hook, the developer processes external input, such as data from the Lambda event, environment variables, or external services.
    - Step 3: The external input is used to dynamically construct or execute code within the `after_restore` hook without proper sanitization or validation. For example, using `eval()`, `exec()`, or similar dynamic execution methods with unsanitized input.
    - Step 4: An attacker, by controlling the external input (e.g., crafting a malicious Lambda event or manipulating environment variables if accessible), can inject arbitrary code into the `after_restore` hook.
    - Step 5: When a Lambda function execution environment is restored from a snapshot and invoked, the injected code within the `after_restore` hook is executed in the Lambda environment.
- Impact:
    - Successful code injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Lambda function's execution environment after a snapshot restore.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Unauthorized access to AWS resources and services that the Lambda function has permissions to access.
        - Data exfiltration or modification.
        - Denial of service by crashing the Lambda function or consuming excessive resources.
        - Lateral movement to other parts of the AWS environment if the Lambda function has access to other systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `snapshot-restore-py` library itself does not implement any mitigations for code injection vulnerabilities in user-defined hooks. The library's code only provides the functionality to register and retrieve hooks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation should be enhanced to explicitly warn users about the risks of processing external input within `after_restore` hooks.
    - Best practices for secure coding in `after_restore` hooks should be provided, emphasizing input sanitization, validation, and avoidance of dynamic code execution with external input.
    - While the library cannot directly prevent code injection in user code, providing clear warnings and secure coding guidelines is a crucial missing mitigation.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must implement an `after_restore` hook in their Lambda function using the `snapshot-restore-py` library.
    - This `after_restore` hook must process external input.
    - The external input must not be properly sanitized or validated before being used in a way that allows code injection (e.g., dynamic code execution).
    - The Lambda function must be SnapStart enabled.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `snapshot_restore_py.py` code defines functions `register_before_snapshot` and `register_after_restore` which store registered functions and their arguments in `_before_snapshot_registry` and `_after_restore_registry` lists respectively.
    ```python
    def register_after_restore(func: Callable[..., Any], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Callable[..., Any]:
        _after_restore_registry.append((func, args, kwargs)) # Stores the function and arguments
        return func
    ```
    - The `get_after_restore` function returns the `_after_restore_registry`.
    ```python
    def get_after_restore() -> list[Callable[..., Any]]:
        return _after_restore_registry # Returns the list of registered functions
    ```
    - The library's code itself does not execute the registered hooks or process any external input.
    - The vulnerability lies in the potential misuse of the `register_after_restore` functionality by users if they implement insecure `after_restore` hooks that process external input without proper security measures.
    - The library's documentation (`README.md`) mentions the possibility of code injection in user-defined `after_restore` hooks, indicating awareness of this potential issue, but it doesn't provide detailed mitigation guidance.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a sample Lambda function using `snapshot-restore-py`.
    - Step 2: In the Lambda function, register an `after_restore` hook using `@register_after_restore`.
    - Step 3: Within the `after_restore` hook, process the Lambda event (external input). For demonstration purposes, use `eval()` to execute code from the event.
    ```python
    from snapshot_restore_py import register_after_restore

    @register_after_restore
    def vulnerable_after_restore(event):
        code_to_execute = event.get('code')
        if code_to_execute:
            eval(code_to_execute) # Vulnerable code: executing external input with eval()

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Lambda function executed'
        }
    ```
    - Step 4: Deploy this Lambda function with SnapStart enabled.
    - Step 5: Invoke the Lambda function with a malicious payload in the event to trigger code injection. For example:
    ```bash
    aws lambda invoke --function-name <your_lambda_function_name> --invocation-type RequestResponse --payload '{"code": "import os; os.system(\"touch /tmp/pwned\")"}' output.json
    ```
    - Step 6: After invocation, check the Lambda execution environment (e.g., using Lambda Layers or by adding logging in the injected code if direct access is not possible) to confirm if the injected code was executed. In this example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created, indicating successful code injection.
    - Step 7: This test case demonstrates how a user can create a vulnerable `after_restore` hook using `snapshot-restore-py` and how an attacker can exploit it through external input.
