## Combined Vulnerability List

### Code Injection in `@register_after_restore` Hook Function

- **Description:**
    - A developer uses the `@register_after_restore` decorator from the `snapshot-restore-py` library to register a hook function that executes after a Lambda function is restored from a snapshot.
    - Inside this `@register_after_restore` hook function, the developer processes external input, such as data from the Lambda event, environment variables, or external services, without proper sanitization or validation.
    - An attacker can craft malicious input (e.g., a malicious Lambda event or manipulated environment variables) containing code or commands.
    - When the Lambda function is invoked with this malicious input and restored from a snapshot, the `@register_after_restore` hook function processes the input data.
    - If the hook function directly executes the untrusted data (e.g., using `eval()`, `exec()`, `os.system()` or similar unsafe functions), the attacker's code or commands will be executed within the Lambda execution environment.

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution within the AWS Lambda environment after a snapshot restore.
    - Potential data exfiltration or modification.
    - Compromise of the Lambda function's role and permissions, potentially leading to further access to AWS resources.
    - Denial of service by crashing the Lambda function or consuming excessive resources.
    - Lateral movement to other parts of the AWS environment if the Lambda function has access to other systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the `snapshot-restore-py` library itself. The library provides the hook registration mechanism but does not enforce secure coding practices within user-defined hook functions.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Enhancement:** The documentation should explicitly warn against processing untrusted input within `@register_after_restore` hook functions and recommend secure coding practices, such as input validation, sanitization, and avoiding dynamic code execution.
    - **Best Practices and Examples:** Provide best practices and illustrative examples of secure coding within `@register_after_restore` hooks, emphasizing input sanitization, validation, and safe alternatives to dynamic code execution.
    - **Security Checklist:** A security checklist or set of guidelines should be provided to developers to help them review their `@register_after_restore` hook implementations for potential code injection vulnerabilities.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must use the `snapshot-restore-py` library and register an `@register_after_restore` hook function.
    - The `@register_after_restore` hook function must process external input (e.g., from Lambda event, environment variables).
    - The hook function must contain a code injection vulnerability, such as using `eval()`, `exec()`, or `os.system()` on untrusted input data.
    - SnapStart must be enabled for the Lambda function.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `snapshot_restore_py.py` file provides decorators and functions (`register_after_restore`) to register functions to be executed after Lambda restore.
    - The relevant code snippet from `snapshot_restore_py.py` is:
    ```python
    _after_restore_registry: list[Callable[..., Any]] = []

    def register_after_restore(func: Callable[..., Any], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Callable[..., Any]:
        _after_restore_registry.append((func, args, kwargs))
        return func
    ```
    - The `register_after_restore` function simply adds the user-provided function `func` and its arguments to the `_after_restore_registry`.
    - The `snapshot-restore-py` library itself does not execute the registered functions or process any input data.
    - **Vulnerability Location**: The vulnerability is not in `snapshot-restore-py` itself, but in the *user-implemented* `@register_after_restore` hook function within the Lambda handler code.
    - **Attack Vector**: An attacker exploits a vulnerable `@register_after_restore` hook by providing malicious input in the Lambda event or other accessible external input sources. When the Lambda is restored and the hook executes, the malicious input is processed by the vulnerable hook function, leading to code injection.
    - **Visualization**:
        1. Developer uses `@register_after_restore` to register `vulnerable_hook`.
        2. `vulnerable_hook` is designed to process external input.
        3. Attacker sends malicious input to Lambda.
        4. Lambda is restored from snapshot.
        5. `vulnerable_hook` executes *after restore*.
        6. `vulnerable_hook` processes malicious input *unsafely*.
        7. Arbitrary code execution occurs due to vulnerability in `vulnerable_hook`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Vulnerable Lambda Function:**
        - Create a Lambda function and enable SnapStart.
        - Include `snapshot-restore-py` in the Lambda function.
        - Define a vulnerable `@register_after_restore` hook in the Lambda function code (e.g., `lambda_handler.py`):
        ```python
        from snapshot_restore_py import register_after_restore
        import os

        @register_after_restore
        def vulnerable_hook(event):
            unsafe_command = event.get('command')
            if unsafe_command:
                os.system(unsafe_command) # Vulnerable code: Using os.system with unsanitized input

        def lambda_handler(event, context):
            return {
                'statusCode': 200,
                'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'
            }
        ```
    2. **Deploy Lambda Function**.
    3. **Craft Malicious Event:**
        - Create a Lambda invocation event with a malicious command in the `command` field:
        ```json
        {
          "command": "whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt"
        }
        ```
    4. **Invoke Lambda Function with Malicious Event:**
        - Invoke the deployed Lambda function with the crafted malicious event.
        - Ensure the Lambda function is restored from a snapshot (invoke it after the first invocation that creates a snapshot).
    5. **Verify Code Execution:**
        - After invocation, check the `/tmp` directory within the Lambda execution environment (e.g., by adding code to the `lambda_handler` to read and return the contents of `/tmp/pwned.txt` in a subsequent invocation, or by checking Lambda logs if commands write to logs).
        - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` should exist and contain the output of the `whoami` command, confirming arbitrary command execution.
    6. **Expected Result:** The test should demonstrate that by providing a malicious event, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands within the Lambda environment via the vulnerable `@register_after_restore` hook.

### Incomplete or Flawed Initialization in `after_restore` Hooks Leading to Insecure State

- **Description:**
    - A developer uses the `@register_after_restore` decorator to register a function that initializes security-sensitive components (e.g., database connections, API clients, security flags) after a Lambda function is restored from a snapshot.
    - The initialization logic within this hook function is flawed or incomplete. This could be due to various reasons, such as:
        - Missing crucial initialization steps.
        - Incorrect order of initialization operations.
        - Unhandled exceptions during initialization that leave the component in a partially initialized and insecure state.
        - Logic errors in handling configuration or credentials.
    - When the Lambda function is restored from a snapshot, the `@register_after_restore` hook is executed. Due to the flawed initialization logic, the security-sensitive components are not properly initialized.
    - Consequently, the Lambda function starts operating in an insecure state after restoration. This insecure state might not be immediately apparent, as the function may still appear to function normally, but critical security measures are not fully in place.

- **Impact:**
    - Depending on the nature of the security-sensitive components and the flaws in their initialization, the impact can range from:
        - Unauthorized access to data or resources if authentication or authorization mechanisms are not correctly initialized.
        - Data breaches or leaks if encryption is not properly enabled or configured.
        - Compromise of the Lambda function's execution environment if security patches or hardening steps are missed during initialization.
        - Unexpected behavior or errors in security-related operations, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The library itself does not provide any mechanisms to validate or enforce correct initialization logic within the registered hook functions. It purely provides the registration and execution framework.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation enhancement:** The documentation should include a strong warning emphasizing the critical importance of ensuring complete and correct initialization logic within `@register_after_restore` hooks, especially when dealing with security-sensitive components.
    - **Best practices and examples:** The documentation should provide best practices and illustrative examples of how to properly initialize security-sensitive components in `@register_after_restore` hooks. This should include guidance on error handling, input validation (if applicable), and complete initialization sequences.
    - **Security checklist:** A security checklist or a set of guidelines should be provided to developers to help them review their `@register_after_restore` hook implementations for potential initialization flaws that could lead to insecure states.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must be using the `snapshot-restore-py` library.
    - The developer must be using the `@register_after_restore` decorator to initialize security-sensitive components.
    - The initialization logic within the registered hook function must contain flaws or be incomplete, leading to an insecure state after restoration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `snapshot_restore_py.py` file defines the `@register_after_restore` decorator and the mechanism to register and store functions to be executed after restore.
    - The relevant code snippet is in `snapshot_restore_py.py`:
      ```python
      _after_restore_registry: list[Callable[..., Any]] = []

      def register_after_restore(func: Callable[..., Any], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Callable[..., Any]:
          _after_restore_registry.append((func, args, kwargs))
          return func
      ```
    - The `register_after_restore` function simply appends the provided function (`func`) and its arguments (`args`, `kwargs`) to the `_after_restore_registry` list.
    - The library itself does not inspect the content or logic of the registered function. It blindly registers and later executes whatever function is provided.
    - The vulnerability arises from the *developer's code* within the function registered with `@register_after_restore`, not from the `snapshot-restore-py` library's code directly.
    - The library is acting as an enabler. If a developer writes insecure initialization code and registers it using `@register_after_restore`, the library will faithfully execute that flawed code after restore, leading to the described vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a Python AWS Lambda function** and include the `snapshot-restore-py` library.
    2. **Define a "security-sensitive component"** within the Lambda function as a boolean flag `is_security_initialized`, initially set to `False`.
    3. **Implement an `@register_after_restore` hook** with flawed initialization logic:
      ```python
      from snapshot_restore_py import register_after_restore

      is_security_initialized = False

      @register_after_restore
      def initialize_security():
          global is_security_initialized
          if some_condition_for_flaw():
              print("Skipping security initialization due to flawed logic!")
              return
          is_security_initialized = True
          print("Security initialized in after_restore hook.")

      def some_condition_for_flaw():
          return True # Always trigger the flaw for this test case

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          global is_security_initialized
          if is_security_initialized:
              return {
                  'statusCode': 200,
                  'body': 'Security is initialized.'
              }
          else:
              return {
                  'statusCode': 500,
                  'body': 'SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Security is NOT initialized after restore!'
              }
      ```
    4. **Deploy this Lambda function with SnapStart enabled.**
    5. **Invoke the Lambda function for the first time.** Observe in the logs "Skipping security initialization due to flawed logic!". The function will likely return a 500 error.
    6. **Invoke the Lambda function again.** This time, it will be restored from the snapshot.
    7. **Observe the output.** It will still indicate "SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Security is NOT initialized after restore!" because the flawed hook skipped initialization during the initial run, and this state is restored.
    8. **Expected Result:** The test demonstrates that flawed initialization logic in `@register_after_restore` hooks leads to a persistent insecure state after Lambda restore.

### Unrestricted Hook Registration leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker compromises the AWS Lambda function's deployment package or source code.
    2. The attacker modifies the Lambda function's code to import the `snapshot_restore_py` library.
    3. The attacker crafts a malicious Python function containing arbitrary code to be executed.
    4. The attacker uses `register_before_snapshot` or `register_after_restore` functions from the `snapshot_restore_py` library to register their malicious function as a runtime hook. This can be done either using the function calls directly or via decorators.
    5. When a snapshot is taken or restored for the Lambda function, the AWS Lambda runtime environment will retrieve the registered hooks using `get_before_snapshot` or `get_after_restore` functions from the `snapshot_restore_py` library.
    6. The Lambda runtime environment will then execute all registered hook functions, including the attacker's malicious function.
    7. The attacker's arbitrary code is executed within the Lambda execution environment during the SnapStart lifecycle event (before snapshot or after restore).

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution within the AWS Lambda environment.
    - Potential data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    - Privilege escalation within the Lambda execution environment.
    - Service disruption or denial of service.
    - Compromise of other AWS resources accessible by the Lambda function's execution role.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The library itself does not implement any input validation, sanitization, or authorization mechanisms to restrict the functions that can be registered as hooks. It blindly registers and returns any callable provided by the user.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** The library could validate the type and potentially the source of the functions being registered as hooks. For example, it could restrict registration to functions defined within specific modules or namespaces.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution of hook functions to limit the impact of malicious code.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Users should be strongly advised to adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring their Lambda functions and execution roles to minimize the potential impact of arbitrary code execution.
    - **Documentation:** Clear documentation emphasizing the security implications of registering hooks and best practices for secure hook implementation is crucial. This includes warning against registering untrusted or dynamically generated functions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the AWS Lambda function's code (e.g., compromised CI/CD pipeline, source code repository access, direct access to deployment package).
    - The Lambda function must be configured to use SnapStart and import and use the `snapshot_restore_py` library.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `snapshot_restore_py.py` file defines two lists: `_before_snapshot_registry` and `_after_restore_registry` to store registered hook functions.
    ```python
    _before_snapshot_registry: list[Callable[..., Any]] = []
    _after_restore_registry: list[Callable[..., Any]] = []
    ```
    2. `register_before_snapshot` and `register_after_restore` functions add functions to these registries without any validation.
    ```python
    def register_before_snapshot(func: Callable[..., Any], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Callable[..., Any]:
        _before_snapshot_registry.append((func, args, kwargs))
        return func

    def register_after_restore(func: Callable[..., Any], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Callable[..., Any]:
        _after_restore_registry.append((func, args, kwargs))
        return func
    ```
    3. `get_before_snapshot` and `get_after_restore` functions return the registry lists, and the Lambda runtime executes each function in these lists.
    ```python
    def get_before_snapshot() -> list[Callable[..., Any]]:
        return _before_snapshot_registry

    def get_after_restore() -> list[Callable[..., Any]]:
        return _after_restore_registry
    ```
    4. The lack of validation in registration allows an attacker to register and execute malicious functions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a new AWS Lambda function** in Python with SnapStart enabled.
    2. **Include `snapshot_restore_py`** in the deployment package.
    3. **Modify `lambda_function.py` to register a malicious hook:**
    ```python
    from snapshot_restore_py import register_before_snapshot
    import os

    def malicious_code():
        open("/tmp/pwned.txt", "w").write("You have been PWNED!")
        print("Malicious code executed!")

    register_before_snapshot(malicious_code)

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'
        }
    ```
    4. **Deploy this Lambda function.**
    5. **Invoke the Lambda function** to initialize and take a snapshot.
    6. **Invoke the Lambda function again.** This should trigger a restore from snapshot.
    7. **Check Lambda function's execution logs in CloudWatch Logs.** Look for "Malicious code executed!" message, confirming malicious hook execution.
    8. **Verify file creation:** Check if `/tmp/pwned.txt` was created within the Lambda environment.
    9. **Expected Result:** The test demonstrates that arbitrary Python code can be injected and executed during the SnapStart lifecycle by registering a malicious function as a hook using `snapshot_restore_py`.
