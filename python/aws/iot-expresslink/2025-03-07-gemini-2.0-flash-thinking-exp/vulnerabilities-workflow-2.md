## Combined Vulnerability List

### Command Injection in AT Command Construction

- **Description:**
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary AT commands by controlling input parameters that are used to construct AT commands sent to the AWS IoT ExpressLink module. This vulnerability arises when applications built using provided SDK libraries (C, Python, Arduino) fail to properly sanitize or validate external or user-provided input before incorporating it into AT command strings.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An application using the provided libraries takes external input, such as user-provided data or data from other untrusted sources (e.g., user input, network data, sensor data that could be manipulated).
        2. This external input is directly incorporated into the construction of an AT command string. For example, an application might construct a command like `AT+SEND=<user_input>` or `AT+CONF DeviceName=<user_provided_name>`.
        3. The application then uses a function like `sendCommand` in `expresslink.py` to send this constructed AT command to the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
        4. If the external input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can embed malicious AT commands within their input. For instance, if the expected input is a simple value, an attacker could provide an input like `value\r\nAT+MALICIOUS_COMMAND` or `vuln\";AT+ MaliciousCommand //`.
        5. The `sendCommand` function sends the entire string as a command sequence. The AWS IoT ExpressLink module, upon receiving the attacker's input, may interpret command separators (e.g., `\r\n`) or command terminators and execute both the intended command fragment and the injected malicious command. For example, input `vuln\";AT+ MaliciousCommand //` might result in the execution of `AT+MaliciousCommand` after `AT+CONF DeviceName=vuln"`.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary AT commands on the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including:
        - Unauthorized control of device functionality managed by AT commands.
        - Modification of device configuration, potentially disrupting normal operation, disabling security features, or altering communication parameters.
        - Disruption of device operation.
        - Potential data exfiltration depending on the AT command set and device capabilities, including sensitive configuration data, such as Wi-Fi credentials or AWS IoT credentials.
        - Control Plane Manipulation: Potentially gaining unauthorized control over the device's connectivity and behavior within the AWS IoT ecosystem.
    - The severity of the impact is high as it could lead to complete compromise of the IoT device's intended behavior.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code examples and libraries do not implement any input sanitization or validation to prevent command injection when constructing AT commands. The `sendCommand` function in `expresslink.py`, for example, directly concatenates user-provided strings into AT commands without any checks. There are no specific mitigations implemented within the provided example code or SDK libraries to prevent AT command injection.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all external inputs before incorporating them into AT command strings. This should include:
        - Escaping special characters that have meaning in AT commands (e.g., `\r`, `\n`, `;`, `=`).
        - Validating input against expected formats and lengths.
        - Using safe command construction methods that avoid direct string concatenation of user inputs into commands.
    - Developer Guidance: Provide clear documentation and secure coding guidelines for developers using these libraries and examples, emphasizing the risks of command injection and best practices for secure AT command construction.
    - Input Validation: Implement input validation to check if user-provided input conforms to the expected format and character set before being used in AT commands.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An application is built using the provided example code or SDK libraries (C, Python, Arduino).
    - This application takes external input from potentially untrusted sources (e.g., user input, network data, sensor data that could be manipulated).
    - The application uses this external input to construct AT commands for controlling the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - No input sanitization is performed on the external input before it is incorporated into the AT command string.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that is used to construct AT commands. This could be through various interfaces depending on the application.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/examples/python/sara_example/expresslink.py`
    - Method: `ExpressLink.sendCommand(self, command:str)->str`
    - Code Snippet:
        ```python
        def sendCommand(self, command:str)->str:
            command += '\n'
            self.port.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
            time.sleep(1)
            response = self.port.readline()
            if response != None:
                return response.decode("utf-8")
            else:
                return ""
        ```
    - Analysis: The `sendCommand` method directly appends a newline character to the input `command` string and sends it over the serial port. There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the `command` parameter. This allows any string passed to `sendCommand` to be executed as an AT command, making it vulnerable to injection if the command string is built using unsanitized external inputs.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Set up the `sara_example` environment, ensuring the `code.py` script can communicate with an AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - Step 2: Modify the `code.py` script to introduce a vulnerability. For example, change the topic configuration command to accept user input for the topic name:
        ```python
        user_topic = input("Enter topic name: ")
        response = el.sendCommand("AT+CONF Topic1=" + user_topic)
        ```
    - Step 3: Run the modified `code.py` script. When prompted to "Enter topic name", input a malicious payload that includes an injected AT command, such as:
        ```
        /weather/injected_topic\r\nAT+RST
        ```
        This input attempts to set the topic to `/weather/injected_topic` and injects the `AT+RST` command to reset the ExpressLink module.
    - Step 4: Observe the serial output and the behavior of the ExpressLink module. If the module resets and restarts its connection process after receiving the input, it indicates successful command injection. The injected `AT+RST` command was executed.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, consider a hypothetical vulnerable application that sets the device name based on user input. Provide a malicious device name as input, for example: `test\"; AT+RST //`.
    - Step 6: Observe the behavior of the ExpressLink module. If the command injection is successful, the ExpressLink module should reset. Monitor the serial output or device behavior to confirm if the reset occurs or if other injected commands are executed.


### Command Injection via Serial Passthrough Example

- **Description:**
    - The `SerialPassthrough` example for Arduino allows users to send AT commands directly to the ExpressLink module via the serial interface. This example is intended for debugging and exploration.
    - An attacker with physical access to the device or control over the serial communication channel could inject arbitrary AT commands.
    - Malicious AT commands could reconfigure the ExpressLink module to connect to attacker-controlled infrastructure, disclose sensitive information, or perform other unauthorized actions.
    - Steps to trigger vulnerability:
        1. Flash the `SerialPassthrough` Arduino sketch onto a compatible Arduino board connected to an ExpressLink module.
        2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE or use another serial communication tool to connect to the Arduino's serial port.
        3. Type an AT command into the Serial Monitor and send it. For example, `AT+WSCAN` to scan for Wi-Fi networks, or `AT+GMR` to get firmware version. A malicious attacker could use commands like `AT+SCON` to change the Wi-Fi credentials or `AT+CERTR` to read certificates if implemented in the ExpressLink module.

- **Impact:**
    - High. Successful command injection can lead to complete compromise of the IoT device's connectivity and potentially data exfiltration or device hijacking. An attacker could:
        - Steal Wi-Fi credentials.
        - Change the AWS IoT Core credentials, disconnecting the device from the legitimate AWS account and potentially connecting it to a malicious one.
        - Read sensitive device information if AT commands are available to expose them.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the provided code. The example is explicitly designed to pass commands through.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The `SerialPassthrough` example, by its nature, will always be vulnerable to command injection if serial access is not strictly controlled. Mitigations should focus on:
        - **Documentation Warning:** Clearly document the security risks of using `SerialPassthrough` in production and advise against it. Emphasize that it's for debugging and exploration only in trusted environments.
        - **Access Control:** If serial passthrough is absolutely necessary for a specific use case, implement strict physical access control to the device and secure the serial communication channel. Consider disabling serial passthrough in production firmware.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Physical access to the device or control over the serial communication channel.
    - The `SerialPassthrough` Arduino sketch must be running on the host microcontroller.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/examples/Arduino/SerialPassthrough/SerialPassthrough.ino`
    - Code Snippet:
    ```arduino
    #include <Arduino.h>
    // ...
    void loop() {
      // Check if data is available from the Serial Monitor
      if (Serial.available()) {
        String command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
        command.trim(); // Remove newline characters and whitespace
        Serial.print("Sending command to ExpressLink: ");
        Serial.println(command);
        EL_SERIAL.println(command); // Forward command to ExpressLink
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
    - Analysis: The code reads serial input from `Serial` (USB Serial Monitor) and directly forwards it to `EL_SERIAL` (Serial1, connected to ExpressLink).
    - There is no input validation or sanitization of the `command` variable before sending it to the ExpressLink module via `EL_SERIAL.println(command);`.
    - Any AT command entered in the Serial Monitor will be executed by the ExpressLink module.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Build and upload the `SerialPassthrough` example to an Arduino board connected to an ExpressLink module.
    2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
    3. Type `AT+GMR` and send. Observe the firmware version response from the ExpressLink module in the Serial Monitor. This confirms command passthrough is working.
    4. **Attempt to inject a command:** Type `AT+WSCAN` to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks. This command should execute without harmful effects but demonstrates arbitrary command execution.
    5. Observe the list of Wi-Fi networks in the Serial Monitor, confirming successful execution of the injected command.
    6. Further testing could involve attempting to use other AT commands (refer to the ExpressLink module's AT command set documentation) to explore the extent of control achievable, such as querying configuration (`AT+CONF?`) or potentially changing network settings (if applicable and implemented in the module).
