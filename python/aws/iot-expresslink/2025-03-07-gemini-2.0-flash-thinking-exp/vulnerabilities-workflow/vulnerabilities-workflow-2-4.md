### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: AT Command Injection

* Description:
    1. An attacker can potentially inject malicious AT commands by controlling parts of the input that is used to construct AT commands sent to the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    2. If an application using the provided SDK libraries (C, Python, Arduino) doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, this input could be incorporated directly into AT commands.
    3. For example, if an application allows a user to set a custom device name, and this name is directly used in an `AT+CONF` command without sanitization, an attacker could inject commands. Assume an application constructs an AT command like `AT+CONF DeviceName=<user_provided_name>`. If the application doesn't sanitize `<user_provided_name>`, an attacker could input a malicious string such as `vuln\";AT+ MaliciousCommand //` .
    4. This could result in the final AT command being interpreted by the ExpressLink module as `AT+CONF DeviceName=vuln\";AT+MaliciousCommand //`. The ExpressLink module might execute `AT+MaliciousCommand` after processing `AT+CONF DeviceName=vuln"`.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary AT commands on the AWS IoT ExpressLink module. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        - **Information Disclosure**: Extracting sensitive configuration data, such as Wi-Fi credentials, AWS IoT credentials, or other device secrets by using AT commands to query configuration.
        - **Device Misconfiguration**: Changing device settings, potentially disrupting normal operation, disabling security features, or altering communication parameters.
        - **Control Plane Manipulation**:  Potentially gaining unauthorized control over the device's connectivity and behavior within the AWS IoT ecosystem depending on the capabilities exposed by the ExpressLink module and the application's implementation.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no specific mitigations implemented within the provided example code or SDK libraries to prevent AT command injection. The code provides the functionality to send AT commands but relies on the application developer to use it securely.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: The project lacks input sanitization functions within the SDK libraries that would help developers to safely construct AT commands from user inputs.
    - **Validation**: There is no input validation implemented to check if the user-provided input conforms to the expected format and character set before being used in AT commands.
    - **Developer Guidelines**: The documentation should include explicit warnings and guidelines for developers about the risks of command injection and best practices for secure AT command construction, emphasizing the need for rigorous input sanitization and validation.

* Preconditions:
    - The application using the AWS IoT ExpressLink SDK libraries must take user-controlled input and incorporate it into AT commands without proper sanitization or validation.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that is used to construct AT commands. This could be through various interfaces depending on the application, such as a web interface, mobile app, or direct interaction with the device.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/examples/python/sara_example/expresslink.py`
    - Function: `sendCommand(self, command:str)->str`
    ```python
    def sendCommand(self, command:str)->str:
        command += '\n'
        self.port.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
        time.sleep(1)
        response = self.port.readline()
        if response != None:
            return response.decode("utf-8")
        else:
            return ""
    ```
    - The `sendCommand` function in `expresslink.py` directly takes a string `command` and sends it over the serial port to the ExpressLink module.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization on the `command` parameter within this function or in the examples that use this function.
    - If a developer uses this `sendCommand` function to send AT commands constructed from unsanitized user inputs, it will be vulnerable to command injection.
    - For example, in a hypothetical vulnerable application:
    ```python
    def set_device_name(user_input_name):
        at_command = "AT+DEVICE_NAME=" + user_input_name # Vulnerable command construction
        response = el.sendCommand(at_command)
        print(response)
    ```
    - In this scenario, a malicious user can inject AT commands through `user_input_name`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Assume a hypothetical vulnerable application built using the provided Python SDK that sets the device name based on user input and uses the `sendCommand` function to send AT commands.  Assume this application has an interface (e.g., a serial terminal or a basic web interface) where you can provide a device name.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection**: Provide a malicious device name as input, for example: `test\"; AT+RST //`. This input is intended to inject the `AT+RST` command after the `AT+DEVICE_NAME` command.
    3. **Expected Behavior**: The application should construct an AT command like `AT+DEVICE_NAME=test\"; AT+RST //` and send it to the ExpressLink module.
    4. **Verification**: Observe the behavior of the ExpressLink module. If the command injection is successful, the ExpressLink module should first attempt to set the device name to `test"` (which might fail or be ignored due to invalid syntax after `test"`). Crucially, it should then execute the injected command `AT+RST`, causing the ExpressLink module to reset.  Monitor the serial output or device behavior to confirm if the reset occurs or if other injected commands are executed (depending on the injected command).
    5. **Success**: If the ExpressLink module resets (or exhibits behavior consistent with the injected command), it confirms the AT command injection vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary AT commands if user input is not properly handled when constructing commands using the provided SDK libraries.
