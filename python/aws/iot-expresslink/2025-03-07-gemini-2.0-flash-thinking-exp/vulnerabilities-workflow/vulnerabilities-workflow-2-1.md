### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in AT Command Construction

- Description:
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary AT commands by controlling input parameters that are used to construct AT commands sent to the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An application using the provided libraries (e.g., `expresslink.py`) takes external input, such as user-provided data or data from other untrusted sources.
        2. This external input is directly incorporated into the construction of an AT command string. For example, an application might construct a command like `AT+SEND=<user_input>`.
        3. The application then uses a function like `sendCommand` in `expresslink.py` to send this constructed AT command to the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
        4. If the external input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can embed malicious AT commands within their input. For instance, if the expected input is a simple value, an attacker could provide an input like `value\r\nAT+MALICIOUS_COMMAND`.
        5. The `sendCommand` function sends the entire string as a command sequence. The AWS IoT ExpressLink module, upon receiving the attacker's input, may interpret `\r\n` as a command separator and execute both the intended command fragment and the injected malicious command.

- Impact:
    - Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary AT commands on the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including:
        - Unauthorized control of device functionality managed by AT commands.
        - Modification of device configuration.
        - Disruption of device operation.
        - Potential data exfiltration depending on the AT command set and device capabilities.
    - The severity of the impact depends on the specific AT commands supported by the module and how the application utilizes them. In critical scenarios, it could lead to complete compromise of the IoT device's intended behavior.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code examples and libraries do not implement any input sanitization or validation to prevent command injection when constructing AT commands. The `sendCommand` function in `expresslink.py`, for example, directly concatenates user-provided strings into AT commands without any checks.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all external inputs before incorporating them into AT command strings. This should include:
        - Escaping special characters that have meaning in AT commands (e.g., `\r`, `\n`, `;`, `=`).
        - Validating input against expected formats and lengths.
        - Using safe command construction methods that avoid direct string concatenation of user inputs into commands.
    - Developer Guidance: Provide clear documentation and secure coding guidelines for developers using these libraries and examples, emphasizing the risks of command injection and best practices for secure AT command construction.

- Preconditions:
    - An application is built using the provided example code or SDK libraries (C, Python, Arduino).
    - This application takes external input from potentially untrusted sources (e.g., user input, network data, sensor data that could be manipulated).
    - The application uses this external input to construct AT commands for controlling the AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - No input sanitization is performed on the external input before it is incorporated into the AT command string.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/examples/python/sara_example/expresslink.py`
    - Method: `ExpressLink.sendCommand(self, command:str)->str`
    - Code Snippet:
        ```python
        def sendCommand(self, command:str)->str:
            command += '\n'
            self.port.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
            time.sleep(1)
            response = self.port.readline()
            if response != None:
                return response.decode("utf-8")
            else:
                return ""
        ```
    - Analysis: The `sendCommand` method directly appends a newline character to the input `command` string and sends it over the serial port. There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the `command` parameter. This allows any string passed to `sendCommand` to be executed as an AT command, making it vulnerable to injection if the command string is built using unsanitized external inputs.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Set up the `sara_example` environment, ensuring the `code.py` script can communicate with an AWS IoT ExpressLink module.
    - Step 2: Modify the `code.py` script to introduce a vulnerability. For example, change the topic configuration command to accept user input for the topic name:
        ```python
        user_topic = input("Enter topic name: ")
        response = el.sendCommand("AT+CONF Topic1=" + user_topic)
        ```
    - Step 3: Run the modified `code.py` script. When prompted to "Enter topic name", input a malicious payload that includes an injected AT command, such as:
        ```
        /weather/injected_topic\r\nAT+RST
        ```
        This input attempts to set the topic to `/weather/injected_topic` and injects the `AT+RST` command to reset the ExpressLink module.
    - Step 4: Observe the serial output and the behavior of the ExpressLink module. If the module resets and restarts its connection process after receiving the input, it indicates successful command injection. The injected `AT+RST` command was executed.
    - Step 5: Further security testing can be performed by injecting other AT commands to explore the extent of control achievable through this vulnerability, such as commands to query configuration (`AT+CONF?`), change network settings (if applicable), or send potentially malicious data.
