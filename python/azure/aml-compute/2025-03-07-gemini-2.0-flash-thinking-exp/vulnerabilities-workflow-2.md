## Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Exposure of Azure Credentials leading to Unauthorized Access to Azure Machine Learning Resources
- Description:
    1. The GitHub Action relies on the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret for authenticating with Azure and managing Azure Machine Learning compute resources.
    2. If an attacker gains access to this `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, they can impersonate the service principal used by the GitHub Action.
    3. This could happen through various means, such as:
        - Compromising the GitHub repository itself (e.g., through stolen developer credentials or repository misconfigurations).
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions platform (less likely but theoretically possible).
        - Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting users with access to the repository secrets.
    4. Once the attacker has the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, they can use it to authenticate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace associated with these credentials.
    5. Subsequently, the attacker can perform actions such as:
        - Creating, deleting, or modifying AML compute clusters and AKS clusters.
        - Accessing data within the Azure Machine Learning workspace if the service principal has sufficient permissions.
        - Launching malicious jobs or workloads on the compute resources, potentially leading to data exfiltration, resource hijacking, or further attacks within the Azure environment.
- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute resources.
    - Potential data breach if the service principal has access to sensitive data.
    - Resource hijacking and misuse, leading to financial costs and operational disruption.
    - Reputation damage for the organization using the compromised credentials.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Secret Masking: The action masks the values of `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` from the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the logs using the `mask_parameter` function in `/code/code/utils.py` and called in `/code/code/main.py`. This prevents accidental exposure of credentials in action logs.
    - Input Validation: The action validates the format of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` using JSON schema validation in `/code/code/utils.py` and schema defined in `/code/code/schemas.py`. This ensures that the provided credentials have the expected structure, but it does not prevent credential theft.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secret Rotation and Management: No mechanism for automated rotation or secure management of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within the GitHub Action or repository.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: The documentation encourages granting "Contributor" role to the service principal. This role might provide broader permissions than strictly necessary for the action to function, increasing the potential impact of credential compromise.  The documentation should be updated to recommend the least privilege principle and suggest more restrictive roles if possible.
    - Monitoring and Alerting: No built-in monitoring or alerting mechanisms within the action to detect unauthorized usage of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to gain access to the GitHub repository's `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret must be valid and have sufficient permissions to access and manage Azure Machine Learning resources.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/code/main.py`:
        ```python
        azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
        try:
            azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials)
        except JSONDecodeError:
            # ... error handling ...
        validate_json(
            data=azure_credentials,
            schema=azure_credentials_schema,
            input_name="AZURE_CREDENTIALS"
        )
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))
        sp_auth = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
            tenant_id=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""),
            service_principal_id=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""),
            service_principal_password=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""),
            cloud=cloud
        )
        ```
        - The code retrieves `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which corresponds to the GitHub secret.
        - It parses the JSON and validates it against the `azure_credentials_schema`.
        - It masks the sensitive parts of the credentials for logging purposes.
        - It then uses these credentials to create a `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object, which is used to authenticate with Azure.
        - If an attacker obtains the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, they can construct the same `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object and gain programmatic access to the Azure ML workspace.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Precondition: Assume you have a GitHub repository with this action configured and the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is set up. You also need to be able to exfiltrate the secret value. For demonstration purposes, we will simulate secret exfiltration by a malicious actor who has gained read access to the repository's secrets (e.g., a compromised collaborator or through a hypothetical GitHub vulnerability).
    2. **Simulate Secret Exfiltration (Manual Step - in a real attack, this would be automated):**
        -  In a real scenario, an attacker might try to exfiltrate secrets through various methods. For this test, we will *assume* the attacker has somehow obtained the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. This step is not about testing the action's code for secret exposure but about demonstrating the *impact* if the secret is exposed.
        - Let's say the attacker now has the JSON content of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    3. **Attacker Action - Authenticate to Azure using Exfiltrated Credentials:**
        - The attacker uses the Azure CLI or Azure SDK, configured with the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. For example, using Azure CLI:
          ```bash
          az login --service-principal -u <clientId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS> -p <clientSecret from AZURE_CREDENTIALS> --tenant <tenantId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS>
          az account set --subscription <subscriptionId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS>
          ```
        - If successful, the attacker is now authenticated to the Azure subscription and can access resources that the service principal has permissions to manage.
    4. **Attacker Action - Access Azure Machine Learning Workspace:**
        - Using the Azure CLI or Azure SDK, the attacker attempts to access the Azure Machine Learning workspace associated with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. They would need to know the workspace name and resource group. Let's assume they can discover this information (e.g., from the repository's configuration or logs if not properly secured).
        - Example using Azure CLI to list compute targets in the workspace:
          ```bash
          az ml compute list --workspace-name <workspace_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
          ```
        - If this command is successful, it confirms that the attacker has successfully used the stolen `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to access and interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    5. **Verification:**
        - Success is verified if the attacker can successfully authenticate to Azure using the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and access the Azure Machine Learning workspace and its resources. This demonstrates the potential for unauthorized access and control if the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is compromised.

- Vulnerability Name: Workflow Modification for Secret Exfiltration
- Description:
    1. A malicious actor with write access to the GitHub repository can modify the workflow YAML file that uses the `Azure/aml-compute` action.
    2. The attacker adds a new step to the workflow designed to print the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow logs. This can be done using a simple `echo` command in a `run` step, referencing the secret using `${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`.
    3. When the modified workflow is executed (e.g., triggered by a push or pull request), this new step will execute and print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow job's output logs.
    4. The attacker, or anyone with access to the workflow logs (depending on repository visibility and permissions), can then view the logs and extract the plaintext `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    5. With the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Ability for the attacker to manage compute resources, access data, train or deploy models within the workspace, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss due to unauthorized resource usage.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The action code itself does not include any mitigations against malicious workflow modifications. The action relies on GitHub's secret masking feature, which masks secrets in logs *after* they are printed, but does not prevent them from being printed in the first place.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The action lacks any mechanism to detect or prevent the exfiltration of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret through malicious workflow modifications.
    - There is no built-in protection against users with write access to the repository misusing secrets within workflow definitions.
- Preconditions:
    - The target repository must be using the `Azure/aml-compute` GitHub Action.
    - The repository must store Azure service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    - A malicious actor must have write access (or be able to compromise an account with write access) to the GitHub repository.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `action.yml` file defines `azure_credentials` as an input, which is expected to be passed as a secret.
    - The `entrypoint.sh` script executes `main.py`.
    - The `main.py` script retrieves `azure_credentials` from the environment variable `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    - The `main.py` script uses `utils.mask_parameter()` to mask parts of the `azure_credentials` in the logs. However, this masking happens *after* the secret is retrieved and processed, and does not prevent a malicious workflow step from directly printing the secret value using `${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`.
    - There are no checks in the action's code to verify the integrity or safety of the workflow definition itself. The action operates under the assumption that the workflow is benign.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a GitHub repository and configure the `Azure/aml-compute` action as described in the action's documentation, ensuring that valid Azure service principal credentials are stored as a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the repository settings.
    2. Edit the workflow YAML file (e.g., the file in `.github/workflows/`) that uses the `Azure/aml-compute` action.
    3. Add a new step to the workflow immediately before or after the `Azure/aml-compute` action step. This step should execute a command to print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow logs. For example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Malicious Secret Exfiltration Step
         run: echo "EXFILTRATED_SECRET::${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
       ```
    4. Commit and push the modified workflow file to the repository to trigger the workflow execution.
    5. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository and view the logs for the workflow run that was triggered by the modified workflow.
    6. In the workflow logs, observe the output from the "Malicious Secret Exfiltration Step". The plaintext value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be visible in the logs, demonstrating successful exfiltration. Although GitHub attempts to mask secrets after they are printed, the secret is still logged and can be observed.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Credential Exposure in Logs
- Description:
    1. The GitHub Action utilizes `print("::debug::...")` statements for logging and debugging purposes.
    2. While the action attempts to mask sensitive parameters like `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` individually using the `mask_parameter()` function, there's a risk that the entire `azure_credentials` JSON object or other unmasked sensitive information from it might be inadvertently logged before the masking is applied or in error scenarios.
    3. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., through misconfigured GitHub repository settings or compromised CI/CD environment), the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` could be exposed.
- Impact:
    - High: Exposure of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and potentially the associated Azure subscription.
    - An attacker could then manage compute resources, access data within the workspace, and potentially pivot to other Azure services depending on the permissions granted to the service principal associated with the compromised credentials.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Parameter masking is implemented in `main.py` using the `mask_parameter()` function for `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId`. This is done after loading the `azure_credentials` from environment variables and before using them to authenticate with Azure.
    - Location: `code/code/main.py`
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Comprehensive review of all `print` statements in `main.py` and `utils.py` to ensure no other parts of the `azure_credentials` object or derived sensitive information are logged, especially in error handling paths or before masking is applied.
    - Implement secure logging practices that avoid printing sensitive information even in debug logs. Consider using structured logging that allows for selective masking and redaction of sensitive data before logging.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs access to the GitHub Actions workflow logs. This could be achieved through:
      - Compromise of a user account with access to the repository's Actions tab.
      - Misconfiguration of repository permissions allowing public access to workflow logs (less likely for private repositories but possible in organizational settings).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `code/code/main.py`, the `azure_credentials` are loaded from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:
       ```python
       azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
       try:
           azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials)
       except JSONDecodeError:
           # ... error message ...
           raise AMLConfigurationException(...)
       ```
    2. Immediately after loading and parsing the JSON, the code attempts to mask specific parameters:
       ```python
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))
       ```
    3. However, if a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, the raw, unmasked `azure_credentials` string from the environment variable might be implicitly logged as part of the error message in the `except` block:
       ```python
       except JSONDecodeError:
           print("::error::Please paste output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac ...")
           raise AMLConfigurationException(...)
       ```
       While this specific error message doesn't directly print `azure_credentials`, other parts of the code or future modifications might inadvertently log the entire object for debugging purposes. A thorough audit of all `print` statements is needed to confirm no such unintentional logging exists.
    4. The `mask_parameter` function in `code/code/utils.py` seems to correctly use `::add-mask::` to mask parameters in GitHub Actions logs.
       ```python
       def mask_parameter(parameter):
           print(f"::add-mask::{parameter}")
       ```
    5. **Visualization:**
       ```mermaid
       graph LR
           A[Start: Workflow Run] --> B{Load AZURE_CREDENTIALS from ENV};
           B -- Success --> C{Parse AZURE_CREDENTIALS as JSON};
           B -- Failure (ENV var missing) --> ErrorHandler;
           C -- Success --> D{Mask individual parameters};
           C -- Failure (JSONDecodeError) --> E[Error Log: Potential Credential Exposure?];
           D --> F[Continue Action Logic];
           E --> ErrorHandler;
           ErrorHandler[Handle Error, Exit];
           F --> ...
           style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
       ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a GitHub repository with a workflow that uses the `Azure/aml-compute@v1` action.
    2. **Action Configuration:** Configure the workflow to intentionally cause a `JSONDecodeError` when parsing `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. This can be done by providing an invalid JSON string as the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the repository settings. For example, set `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to `"invalid-json-string"`.
    3. **Trigger Workflow:** Run the workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit).
    4. **Examine Logs:** After the workflow run fails, go to the Actions tab in the repository and inspect the logs for the failed workflow run.
    5. **Verify Exposure:** Search the logs for the invalid JSON string `"invalid-json-string"` or any parts of a valid credential structure (like `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `tenantId`, `subscriptionId` keywords) that might have been logged in the error message or surrounding debug output *before* the masking could be applied.
    6. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the logs might contain the unmasked invalid JSON string or error messages that reveal parts of a potentially valid credential structure if the error handling is not carefully implemented. If mitigated, the logs should not reveal any sensitive credential information, even in error scenarios.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Compute Configuration via Malicious Parameters File
- Description:
    - An attacker can attempt to trick a user into using a malicious `parameters_file`.
    - This file, when processed by the GitHub Action, can configure Azure Machine Learning compute resources in an insecure manner.
    - For example, an attacker could set `remote_login_port_public_access` to "Enabled" in the `parameters_file` for AML clusters. This action opens SSH ports publicly, which is generally discouraged for security reasons.
    - Another example is related to AKS clusters. While less directly security impacting, an attacker could set `cluster_purpose` to `"DevTest"` which provisions components at a minimal level for testing, potentially impacting performance or reliability if the user expects a production-ready setup.
- Impact:
    - By controlling the compute configuration, an attacker could potentially cause creation of insecure compute resources in the user's Azure subscription.
    - For AML clusters, enabling `remote_login_port_public_access` opens SSH ports, increasing the attack surface and potentially allowing unauthorized access to compute nodes if default credentials or weak passwords are used, or if there are other vulnerabilities in the system.
    - For AKS clusters, setting `cluster_purpose` to `"DevTest"` might lead to under-provisioned clusters not suitable for the intended workload.
    - In general, malicious configurations can lead to unexpected behavior, performance issues, or security compromises within the Azure Machine Learning environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - JSON schema validation of `parameters_file` using `parameters_schema` in `code/schemas.py`.
    - Input validation using `validate_json` function in `code/utils.py` to ensure the `parameters_file` adheres to the defined schema.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for specific security-sensitive parameters beyond schema validation. For example, explicitly checking and warning or blocking against enabling `remote_login_port_public_access` unless explicitly intended and understood by the user.
    - Documentation should strongly advise against insecure configurations like enabling public SSH access for AML clusters and clarify the security implications. It should also guide users towards secure configuration practices.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the `parameters_file` used by the GitHub Action. This could be achieved if:
        - The user is tricked into using a malicious `parameters_file` provided by the attacker.
        - The attacker has write access to the repository and can modify the `parameters_file` in the `.cloud/.azure` directory.
        - The attacker can influence the `parameters_file` path via the `parameters_file` input to the GitHub Action if it were not fixed to a specific location (currently, it's read from `.cloud/.azure` directory relative to the repository root, but if the action were to allow arbitrary paths, it would increase the risk).
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in how the action processes the `parameters_file` and uses its values to configure the compute targets, specifically in `code/utils.py` within the `create_aml_cluster` and `create_aks_cluster` functions.
    - **`code/utils.py` - `create_aml_cluster` function:**
        ```python
        def create_aml_cluster(workspace, parameters):
            # ...
            aml_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(
                vm_size=parameters.get("vm_size", "Standard_DS3_v2"),
                vm_priority=parameters.get("vm_priority", "dedicated"),
                min_nodes=parameters.get("min_nodes", 0),
                max_nodes=parameters.get("max_nodes", 4),
                idle_seconds_before_scaledown=parameters.get("idle_seconds_before_scaledown", None),
                tags={"Created": "GitHub Action: Azure/aml-compute"},
                description="AML Cluster created by Azure/aml-compute GitHub Action",
                remote_login_port_public_access=parameters.get("remote_login_port_public_access", "NotSpecified") # Vulnerable line
            )
            # ...
        ```
        - In this code, the `remote_login_port_public_access` parameter for `AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration` is directly taken from the user-provided `parameters` dictionary without any additional security checks or validation beyond the schema validation which only checks for allowed string values ("Enabled", "Disabled", "NotSpecified") but not the security implications of these values.
    - **`code/utils.py` - `create_aks_cluster` function:**
        ```python
        def create_aks_cluster(workspace, parameters):
            # ...
            aks_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration(
                agent_count=parameters.get("agent_count", None),
                vm_size=parameters.get("vm_size", "Standard_D3_v2"),
                location=parameters.get("location", None),
                service_cidr=parameters.get("service_cidr", None),
                dns_service_ip=parameters.get("dns_service_ip", None),
                docker_bridge_cidr=parameters.get("docker_bridge_cidr", None)
            )

            if "dev" in parameters.get("cluster_purpose", "").lower() or "test" in parameters.get("cluster_purpose", "").lower(): # Vulnerable line
                aks_config.cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.DEV_TEST
            # ...
        ```
        - Similarly, the `cluster_purpose` parameter, while not directly a high-security risk, is also taken directly from user input. An attacker could influence this to create a `DevTest` cluster when the user expects a `FastProd` cluster.
    - **`code/main.py`**:
        - Loads the `parameters_file` from the `.cloud/.azure` directory and passes the loaded JSON to `create_aml_cluster` or `create_aks_cluster`.
        - The `validate_json` function is called to validate against `parameters_schema`, but this schema does not prevent insecure configurations.
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a GitHub repository.
        - Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and obtain Azure credentials as a service principal.
        - In the GitHub repository, create a workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/create-compute.yml`) that uses the `Azure/aml-compute@v1` action. Configure it to use the Azure credentials secret and the `parameters_file` input.
        - Store the Azure credentials as a repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    2. **Create Malicious `parameters_file`:**
        - In the repository, create the directory `.cloud/.azure` and inside it create a file named `compute.json` with the following malicious content to enable public SSH for AML cluster:
            ```json
            {
                "compute_type": "amlcluster",
                "name": "insecure-aml-compute",
                "remote_login_port_public_access": "Enabled"
            }
            ```
        - To test AKS cluster `cluster_purpose` manipulation, create `compute.json` with:
            ```json
            {
                "compute_type": "akscluster",
                "name": "devtest-aks-compute",
                "cluster_purpose": "DevTest"
            }
            ```
    3. **Trigger Workflow:**
        - Commit and push the malicious `compute.json` file and the workflow file to the GitHub repository. This will trigger the GitHub Action workflow.
    4. **Verify Insecure Configuration (AML Cluster - Public SSH):**
        - After the workflow run succeeds, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal.
        - Go to the "Compute" section and find the AML Compute cluster named "insecure-aml-compute".
        - Inspect the cluster details and configuration.
        - Verify that the "Public SSH port access" is set to "Enabled". This confirms the vulnerability: the malicious `parameters_file` successfully configured the AML cluster to have public SSH access enabled.
    5. **Verify Configuration (AKS Cluster - Cluster Purpose):**
        - After the workflow run succeeds, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal.
        - Go to the "Compute" section and find the AKS Compute cluster named "devtest-aks-compute".
        - Inspect the cluster details and configuration.
        - Verify that the cluster purpose is set to "DevTest" (if visible in the UI, otherwise infer from cluster characteristics like node count if `cluster_purpose` influences it directly). This confirms that the `cluster_purpose` was influenced by the malicious `parameters_file`.
