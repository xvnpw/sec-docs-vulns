### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Workflow Modification for Secret Exfiltration
- Description:
    1. A malicious actor with write access to the GitHub repository can modify the workflow YAML file that uses the `Azure/aml-compute` action.
    2. The attacker adds a new step to the workflow designed to print the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow logs. This can be done using a simple `echo` command in a `run` step, referencing the secret using `${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`.
    3. When the modified workflow is executed (e.g., triggered by a push or pull request), this new step will execute and print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow job's output logs.
    4. The attacker, or anyone with access to the workflow logs (depending on repository visibility and permissions), can then view the logs and extract the plaintext `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    5. With the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Ability for the attacker to manage compute resources, access data, train or deploy models within the workspace, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss due to unauthorized resource usage.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The action code itself does not include any mitigations against malicious workflow modifications. The action relies on GitHub's secret masking feature, which masks secrets in logs *after* they are printed, but does not prevent them from being printed in the first place.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The action lacks any mechanism to detect or prevent the exfiltration of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret through malicious workflow modifications.
    - There is no built-in protection against users with write access to the repository misusing secrets within workflow definitions.
- Preconditions:
    - The target repository must be using the `Azure/aml-compute` GitHub Action.
    - The repository must store Azure service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    - A malicious actor must have write access (or be able to compromise an account with write access) to the GitHub repository.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `action.yml` file defines `azure_credentials` as an input, which is expected to be passed as a secret.
    - The `entrypoint.sh` script executes `main.py`.
    - The `main.py` script retrieves `azure_credentials` from the environment variable `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    - The `main.py` script uses `utils.mask_parameter()` to mask parts of the `azure_credentials` in the logs. However, this masking happens *after* the secret is retrieved and processed, and does not prevent a malicious workflow step from directly printing the secret value using `${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`.
    - There are no checks in the action's code to verify the integrity or safety of the workflow definition itself. The action operates under the assumption that the workflow is benign.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a GitHub repository and configure the `Azure/aml-compute` action as described in the action's documentation, ensuring that valid Azure service principal credentials are stored as a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the repository settings.
    2. Edit the workflow YAML file (e.g., the file in `.github/workflows/`) that uses the `Azure/aml-compute` action.
    3. Add a new step to the workflow immediately before or after the `Azure/aml-compute` action step. This step should execute a command to print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow logs. For example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Malicious Secret Exfiltration Step
         run: echo "EXFILTRATED_SECRET::${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
       ```
    4. Commit and push the modified workflow file to the repository to trigger the workflow execution.
    5. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository and view the logs for the workflow run that was triggered by the modified workflow.
    6. In the workflow logs, observe the output from the "Malicious Secret Exfiltration Step". The plaintext value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be visible in the logs, demonstrating successful exfiltration. Although GitHub attempts to mask secrets after they are printed, the secret is still logged and can be observed.
