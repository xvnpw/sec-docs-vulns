### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Exposure of Azure Credentials leading to Unauthorized Access to Azure Machine Learning Resources
- Description:
    1. The GitHub Action relies on the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret for authenticating with Azure and managing Azure Machine Learning compute resources.
    2. If an attacker gains access to this `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, they can impersonate the service principal used by the GitHub Action.
    3. This could happen through various means, such as:
        - Compromising the GitHub repository itself (e.g., through stolen developer credentials or repository misconfigurations).
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions platform (less likely but theoretically possible).
        - Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting users with access to the repository secrets.
    4. Once the attacker has the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, they can use it to authenticate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace associated with these credentials.
    5. Subsequently, the attacker can perform actions such as:
        - Creating, deleting, or modifying AML compute clusters and AKS clusters.
        - Accessing data within the Azure Machine Learning workspace if the service principal has sufficient permissions.
        - Launching malicious jobs or workloads on the compute resources, potentially leading to data exfiltration, resource hijacking, or further attacks within the Azure environment.
- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute resources.
    - Potential data breach if the service principal has access to sensitive data.
    - Resource hijacking and misuse, leading to financial costs and operational disruption.
    - Reputation damage for the organization using the compromised credentials.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Secret Masking: The action masks the values of `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` from the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the logs using the `mask_parameter` function in `/code/code/utils.py` and called in `/code/code/main.py`. This prevents accidental exposure of credentials in action logs.
    - Input Validation: The action validates the format of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` using JSON schema validation in `/code/code/utils.py` and schema defined in `/code/code/schemas.py`. This ensures that the provided credentials have the expected structure, but it does not prevent credential theft.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secret Rotation and Management: No mechanism for automated rotation or secure management of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within the GitHub Action or repository.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: The documentation encourages granting "Contributor" role to the service principal. This role might provide broader permissions than strictly necessary for the action to function, increasing the potential impact of credential compromise.  The documentation should be updated to recommend the least privilege principle and suggest more restrictive roles if possible.
    - Monitoring and Alerting: No built-in monitoring or alerting mechanisms within the action to detect unauthorized usage of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to gain access to the GitHub repository's `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret must be valid and have sufficient permissions to access and manage Azure Machine Learning resources.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/code/main.py`:
        ```python
        azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
        try:
            azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials)
        except JSONDecodeError:
            # ... error handling ...
        validate_json(
            data=azure_credentials,
            schema=azure_credentials_schema,
            input_name="AZURE_CREDENTIALS"
        )
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))
        sp_auth = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
            tenant_id=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""),
            service_principal_id=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""),
            service_principal_password=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""),
            cloud=cloud
        )
        ```
        - The code retrieves `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which corresponds to the GitHub secret.
        - It parses the JSON and validates it against the `azure_credentials_schema`.
        - It masks the sensitive parts of the credentials for logging purposes.
        - It then uses these credentials to create a `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object, which is used to authenticate with Azure.
        - If an attacker obtains the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, they can construct the same `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object and gain programmatic access to the Azure ML workspace.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Precondition: Assume you have a GitHub repository with this action configured and the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is set up. You also need to be able to exfiltrate the secret value. For demonstration purposes, we will simulate secret exfiltration by a malicious actor who has gained read access to the repository's secrets (e.g., a compromised collaborator or through a hypothetical GitHub vulnerability).
    2. **Simulate Secret Exfiltration (Manual Step - in a real attack, this would be automated):**
        -  In a real scenario, an attacker might try to exfiltrate secrets through various methods. For this test, we will *assume* the attacker has somehow obtained the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. This step is not about testing the action's code for secret exposure but about demonstrating the *impact* if the secret is exposed.
        - Let's say the attacker now has the JSON content of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    3. **Attacker Action - Authenticate to Azure using Exfiltrated Credentials:**
        - The attacker uses the Azure CLI or Azure SDK, configured with the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. For example, using Azure CLI:
          ```bash
          az login --service-principal -u <clientId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS> -p <clientSecret from AZURE_CREDENTIALS> --tenant <tenantId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS>
          az account set --subscription <subscriptionId from AZURE_CREDENTIALS>
          ```
        - If successful, the attacker is now authenticated to the Azure subscription and can access resources that the service principal has permissions to manage.
    4. **Attacker Action - Access Azure Machine Learning Workspace:**
        - Using the Azure CLI or Azure SDK, the attacker attempts to access the Azure Machine Learning workspace associated with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. They would need to know the workspace name and resource group. Let's assume they can discover this information (e.g., from the repository's configuration or logs if not properly secured).
        - Example using Azure CLI to list compute targets in the workspace:
          ```bash
          az ml compute list --workspace-name <workspace_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
          ```
        - If this command is successful, it confirms that the attacker has successfully used the stolen `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to access and interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    5. **Verification:**
        - Success is verified if the attacker can successfully authenticate to Azure using the exfiltrated `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and access the Azure Machine Learning workspace and its resources. This demonstrates the potential for unauthorized access and control if the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is compromised.

This test case demonstrates the vulnerability by showing that if an attacker obtains the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, they can gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning resources managed by this GitHub Action. While the action itself doesn't *expose* the secret in its code, the reliance on a highly sensitive secret stored in GitHub Secrets represents a significant security risk if that secret is compromised through other means.
