### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Credential Exposure in Logs
  - Description:
    1. The GitHub Action utilizes `print("::debug::...")` statements for logging and debugging purposes.
    2. While the action attempts to mask sensitive parameters like `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` individually using the `mask_parameter()` function, there's a risk that the entire `azure_credentials` JSON object or other unmasked sensitive information from it might be inadvertently logged before the masking is applied or in error scenarios.
    3. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., through misconfigured GitHub repository settings or compromised CI/CD environment), the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` could be exposed.
  - Impact:
    - High: Exposure of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and potentially the associated Azure subscription.
    - An attacker could then manage compute resources, access data within the workspace, and potentially pivot to other Azure services depending on the permissions granted to the service principal associated with the compromised credentials.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Parameter masking is implemented in `main.py` using the `mask_parameter()` function for `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId`. This is done after loading the `azure_credentials` from environment variables and before using them to authenticate with Azure.
    - Location: `code/code/main.py`
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Comprehensive review of all `print` statements in `main.py` and `utils.py` to ensure no other parts of the `azure_credentials` object or derived sensitive information are logged, especially in error handling paths or before masking is applied.
    - Implement secure logging practices that avoid printing sensitive information even in debug logs. Consider using structured logging that allows for selective masking and redaction of sensitive data before logging.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs access to the GitHub Actions workflow logs. This could be achieved through:
      - Compromise of a user account with access to the repository's Actions tab.
      - Misconfiguration of repository permissions allowing public access to workflow logs (less likely for private repositories but possible in organizational settings).
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `code/code/main.py`, the `azure_credentials` are loaded from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:
       ```python
       azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
       try:
           azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials)
       except JSONDecodeError:
           # ... error message ...
           raise AMLConfigurationException(...)
       ```
    2. Immediately after loading and parsing the JSON, the code attempts to mask specific parameters:
       ```python
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
       mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))
       ```
    3. However, if a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, the raw, unmasked `azure_credentials` string from the environment variable might be implicitly logged as part of the error message in the `except` block:
       ```python
       except JSONDecodeError:
           print("::error::Please paste output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac ...")
           raise AMLConfigurationException(...)
       ```
       While this specific error message doesn't directly print `azure_credentials`, other parts of the code or future modifications might inadvertently log the entire object for debugging purposes. A thorough audit of all `print` statements is needed to confirm no such unintentional logging exists.
    4. The `mask_parameter` function in `code/code/utils.py` seems to correctly use `::add-mask::` to mask parameters in GitHub Actions logs.
       ```python
       def mask_parameter(parameter):
           print(f"::add-mask::{parameter}")
       ```
    5. **Visualization:**
       ```mermaid

           B -- Success --> C{Parse AZURE_CREDENTIALS as JSON};
           B -- Failure (ENV var missing) --> ErrorHandler;
           C -- Success --> D{Mask individual parameters};

       ```

  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a GitHub repository with a workflow that uses the `Azure/aml-compute@v1` action.
    2. **Action Configuration:** Configure the workflow to intentionally cause a `JSONDecodeError` when parsing `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. This can be done by providing an invalid JSON string as the value of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the repository settings. For example, set `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to `"invalid-json-string"`.
    3. **Trigger Workflow:** Run the workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit).
    4. **Examine Logs:** After the workflow run fails, go to the Actions tab in the repository and inspect the logs for the failed workflow run.
    5. **Verify Exposure:** Search the logs for the invalid JSON string `"invalid-json-string"` or any parts of a valid credential structure (like `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `tenantId`, `subscriptionId` keywords) that might have been logged in the error message or surrounding debug output *before* the masking could be applied.
    6. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the logs might contain the unmasked invalid JSON string or error messages that reveal parts of a potentially valid credential structure if the error handling is not carefully implemented. If mitigated, the logs should not reveal any sensitive credential information, even in error scenarios.

- Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Validation of Compute Parameters
  - Description:
    1. The action relies on JSON schema validation (`validate_json` function and `parameters_schema`) to check the structure and data types of parameters provided in the `parameters_file`.
    2. While the schema enforces basic constraints, it may lack deeper semantic or value-based validation to prevent insecure or misconfigured compute target setups.
    3. For instance, the schema doesn't restrict VM sizes to secure or recommended options, doesn't enforce minimum or maximum node counts based on security best practices, or doesn't validate network configurations for potential security misconfigurations.
    4. This could allow users to unintentionally (or intentionally, in case of malicious actors with repository access) create compute targets with insecure configurations.
  - Impact:
    - Medium: Creation of insecurely configured compute targets could increase the attack surface of the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Examples of insecure configurations:
      - Using overly permissive network settings, making compute nodes publicly accessible when they should be isolated.
      - Choosing weak VM sizes that are easily compromised.
      - Setting up clusters with unnecessarily large node counts, increasing the potential impact of a compromise.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - JSON schema validation is implemented using the `validate_json` function in `utils.py` and the `parameters_schema` defined in `schemas.py`.
    - Location: `code/code/utils.py` and `code/code/schemas.py`
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement value-based validation within the action's code (in `main.py`, `utils.py`, or dedicated validation functions) to enforce secure parameter values beyond what the JSON schema provides.
    - Examples of missing validations:
      - **VM Size Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Restrict allowed VM sizes to a predefined list of secure and recommended options. Potentially blacklist known insecure or outdated VM sizes.
      - **Node Count Limits:** Enforce reasonable minimum and maximum node counts based on security best practices and typical use cases. Prevent excessively large or small clusters if they pose security risks.
      - **Network Configuration Validation:** If network parameters (`vnet_resource_group_name`, `vnet_name`, `subnet_name`) are provided, perform checks to ensure they align with security best practices (e.g., ensure subnets are properly isolated, Network Security Groups are configured).
      - **Parameter Interdependency Validation:** Validate combinations of parameters that could lead to insecure configurations. For example, warn or prevent the use of `remote_login_port_public_access: Enabled` in combination with certain network configurations.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the `compute.json` file in the repository. This could be:
      - A repository maintainer with write access who intentionally introduces insecure configurations.
      - A compromised user account with write access to the repository.
      - In less secure scenarios, if the repository is public and allows external contributions without thorough review.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `validate_json` function in `code/code/utils.py` performs schema validation:
       ```python
       def validate_json(data, schema, input_name):
           validator = jsonschema.Draft7Validator(schema)
           errors = list(validator.iter_errors(data))
           if len(errors) > 0:
               for error in errors:
                   print(f"::error::JSON validation error: {error}")
               raise AMLConfigurationException(...)
           else:
               print(f"::debug::JSON validation passed for '{input_name}'. ...")
       ```
    2. The `parameters_schema` in `code/code/schemas.py` defines basic type and format constraints:
       ```python
       parameters_schema = {
           # ...
           "properties": {
               "vm_size": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "The size of agent VMs..."
               },
               "vm_priority": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "The VM priority.",
                   "pattern": "dedicated|lowpriority"
               },
               "min_nodes": {
                   "type": "integer",
                   "description": "The minimum number of nodes...",
                   "minimum": 0
               },
               "max_nodes": {
                   "type": "integer",
                   "description": "The maximum number of nodes...",
                   "minimum": 1
               },
               # ... and so on for other parameters
           }
       }
       ```
    3. Review of `create_aml_cluster` and `create_aks_cluster` in `code/code/utils.py` shows that parameters are mostly passed directly to the Azure SDK provisioning configurations without additional value-based checks. For example, in `create_aml_cluster`:
       ```python
       aml_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(
           vm_size=parameters.get("vm_size", "Standard_DS3_v2"),
           vm_priority=parameters.get("vm_priority", "dedicated"),
           min_nodes=parameters.get("min_nodes", 0),
           max_nodes=parameters.get("max_nodes", 4),
           # ... other parameters ...
       )
       ```
       There are no checks to ensure `vm_size` is a secure choice, `min_nodes` and `max_nodes` are within safe ranges, or network settings are secure.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a GitHub repository with a workflow that uses the `Azure/aml-compute@v1` action.
    2. **Create Insecure Parameters File:** Create a `compute.json` file in the `.cloud/.azure` directory of the repository with potentially insecure parameter values. Examples:
       - Set `vm_size` to a very basic or potentially outdated VM size known to have security vulnerabilities (if such exist in Azure's offerings).
       - Set `max_nodes` to a very large number (e.g., `999`) to test if there are limits on cluster size from a security perspective.
       - If possible, try to provide network configurations in `compute.json` that are known to be less secure (e.g., try to bypass VNet settings if isolation is expected).  (Note: the current schema and code might not have parameters that directly control all aspects of network security, but test relevant network-related parameters if available).
    3. **Workflow Configuration:** Ensure the workflow uses this `compute.json` file by either not setting `parameters_file` input (using default `compute.json`) or explicitly setting `parameters_file: ".cloud/.azure/compute.json"`.
    4. **Trigger Workflow:** Run the workflow.
    5. **Examine Created Compute Target:** After the workflow succeeds, go to the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal and inspect the properties of the created compute target.
    6. **Verify Insecure Configuration:** Check if the compute target was indeed created with the insecure parameters specified in `compute.json` (e.g., the insecure VM size, excessive node count, or potentially insecure network settings if applicable).
    7. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the action will successfully create a compute target with the insecure configurations defined in `compute.json` without raising errors or warnings related to security. If mitigated, the action should either reject the insecure parameters (e.g., through validation errors) or provide warnings and guidance on secure configurations.
