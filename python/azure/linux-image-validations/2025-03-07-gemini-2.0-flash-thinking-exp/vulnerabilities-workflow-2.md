### Combined Vulnerability Report

This report summarizes the high and critical vulnerabilities identified across multiple vulnerability lists, after removing duplicates and excluding vulnerabilities that do not meet the specified criteria.

#### Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Archive

- Description:
    - The `validate_upload.sh` script is designed to be uploaded and executed on the Azure validation VM.
    - The script unpacks the `validator.tar.gz` archive, which is expected to be placed in the same directory as the script.
    - The script then executes `validate.py` script from the unpacked archive with root privileges using `sudo`.
    - If an attacker can replace the legitimate `validator.tar.gz` archive with a malicious one, they can inject arbitrary code.
    - The malicious archive can contain a modified `validate.py` or other malicious scripts.
    - When `validate_upload.sh` unpacks and executes the contents, the attacker's malicious code will run with root privileges, leading to full system compromise of the validation VM.
- Impact: Critical. Arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the validation VM. This allows a complete compromise of the validation environment, potentially leading to data exfiltration, further attacks on Azure infrastructure, or use of the compromised VM for malicious purposes.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The project does not implement any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the `validator.tar.gz` archive before unpacking and executing its contents.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Archive Integrity Check**: Implement a robust mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the `validator.tar.gz` archive before it is unpacked and executed. This can be achieved through:
        - **Digital Signatures**: Sign the `validator.tar.gz` archive using a strong cryptographic key. The `validate_upload.sh` script should then verify this signature before proceeding with unpacking and execution.
        - **Checksum Verification**: Generate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) of the legitimate `validator.tar.gz` archive. Securely store this checksum and include it in the validation process. The `validate_upload.sh` script should calculate the checksum of the downloaded `validator.tar.gz` and compare it against the stored checksum. If the checksums do not match, the script should halt execution and report an error.
    - **Secure Distribution Channel**: Ensure that the distribution channel for the `validator.tar.gz` archive is secure and protected from unauthorized modifications. If users are instructed to upload the archive to an Azure Storage Account, ensure that appropriate access controls and security measures are in place to prevent attackers from replacing the legitimate archive.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: While validation scripts may require elevated privileges, carefully review the necessity of running `tar` and `python` with `sudo`. If `sudo` is unavoidable, minimize the scope of operations performed with root privileges and ensure that any executed scripts are thoroughly vetted and trusted.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to replace the legitimate `validator.tar.gz` archive with a malicious one. This could be achieved by compromising the storage location of the archive or through a Man-in-the-Middle attack during transfer if the archive is downloaded over an insecure channel (though the provided script assumes it's already present).
    - A user must download and execute the `validate_upload.sh` script within their Azure environment, as instructed in the project documentation.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/validate_upload.sh`
    - Vulnerable lines:
        ```bash
        sudo $(which tar) -xzf validator.tar.gz

        [[ -n "$(uname -a | grep -i $distro)" || -n "$(uname -a | grep -i debian)" ]] && sudo $(which python) validate.py
        [[ -n "$(uname -a | grep -i $redhat)" || -n "$(uname -a | grep -i centos)" ]] && sudo $(which platform_python) validate.py
        ```
    - **`sudo $(which tar) -xzf validator.tar.gz`**: This line unpacks the `validator.tar.gz` archive using `tar`. The `-z` option decompresses gzip archives, `-x` extracts files, and `-f` specifies the archive file. The use of `sudo` executes `tar` with root privileges. There are no checks performed on the archive before extraction. A malicious archive could contain files that overwrite system files, or scripts that execute malicious commands upon extraction.
    - **`sudo $(which python) validate.py` and `sudo $(which platform_python) validate.py`**: These lines conditionally execute `validate.py` with root privileges based on the detected Linux distribution. The script assumes that `validate.py` is a trusted script within the unpacked archive. If a malicious `validator.tar.gz` replaces the legitimate one, this will execute a potentially attacker-controlled `validate.py` with root privileges.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Archive**:
        - Create a new directory, for example `malicious_validator`.
        - Inside `malicious_validator`, create a malicious `validate.py` file with the following content:
            ```python
            import os

            # Create a marker file to indicate successful malicious code execution
            os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_by_malicious_validator")

            # Optionally, execute more harmful commands like creating a backdoor user
            # os.system("useradd -M -s /bin/bash backdoor_user")
            # os.system("echo 'backdoor_password' | passwd --stdin backdoor_user")
            # os.system("echo 'backdoor_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers")

            print("Malicious validate.py executed!")
            ```
        - Create a `validator.tar.gz` archive from the `malicious_validator` directory:
            ```bash
            tar -cvzf validator.tar.gz malicious_validator
            ```
    2. **Set up Test Environment**:
        - Deploy an Azure Linux VM to act as the validation target.
        - Upload the `validate_upload.sh` script and the newly created `validator.tar.gz` to the home directory of the VM (or any directory accessible to the user).
    3. **Execute the Validation Script**:
        - Connect to the Azure VM via SSH.
        - Navigate to the directory where `validate_upload.sh` and `validator.tar.gz` are located.
        - Execute the `validate_upload.sh` script:
            ```bash
            bash validate_upload.sh test-vhd test-generation
            ```
    4. **Verify Exploitation**:
        - After the script completes, check for the marker file created by the malicious script.
        - Execute the following command on the validation VM:
            ```bash
            ls /tmp/pwned_by_malicious_validator
            ```
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned_by_malicious_validator` exists, it confirms that the malicious `validate.py` script within the crafted `validator.tar.gz` was executed successfully, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
        - Optionally, if you included commands to create a backdoor user, attempt to log in using the backdoor credentials to further verify the impact.

#### Vulnerability 2: Command Injection in `LoadDriver.sh` via OS detection

- Description:
  1. The `validate.py` script, executed within the validation VM, invokes `LoadDriver.sh` script.
  2. `LoadDriver.sh` script determines the OS version by executing `OS_details.sh 1` and stores the output in the `OS` variable.
  3. `OS_details.sh` script reads various OS release files within the VHD image like `/etc/oracle-release`, `/etc/redhat-release`, `/etc/SuSE-release`, `/etc/os-release`, `/etc/lsb-release`, `/etc/debian_version` to identify the OS.
  4. The identified `OS` variable is then used in a `wget` command to download a driver: `wget https://rheldriverssa.blob.core.windows.net/involflt-`tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< $OS`/$drvName`.
  5. If an attacker crafts a malicious VHD image and modifies the OS release files (e.g., `/etc/oracle-release`) to inject a command into the output of `OS_details.sh`, this injected command will be executed as part of the `wget` command line.
  6. For example, by modifying `/etc/oracle-release` to contain `Oracle Linux Server release 7; touch /tmp/pwned`, the `OS_details.sh` script will output `OL7-64; touch /tmp/pwned`.
  7. This output, when assigned to the `OS` variable in `LoadDriver.sh`, will lead to the execution of `wget https://rheldriverssa.blob.core.windows.net/involflt-`tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< 'OL7-64; touch /tmp/pwned'`/$drvName`.
  8. Due to shell command substitution, the `touch /tmp/pwned` command will be executed on the validation VM, achieving command injection.
- Impact:
  - Arbitrary command execution on the validation virtual machine.
  - An attacker can gain full control of the validation VM, potentially exfiltrate sensitive information, or use it as a pivot to attack other Azure resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly uses the output of `OS_details.sh` in a shell command without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization and validation for the output of `OS_details.sh` before using it in shell commands.
  - Securely constructing the `wget` command, avoiding shell command injection vulnerabilities. For example, by using array arguments for `wget` instead of a single string.
  - Consider using a safer way to determine OS version that is less prone to manipulation from within the VHD image itself.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker must be able to create a malicious VHD image.
  - The validation pipeline must be executed on this malicious VHD image.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/validations/image_validator/ASR/LoadDriver.sh`
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh

  DIR=`dirname $0`
  OS=`${DIR}/OS_details.sh 1`  # Vulnerable line: Output of OS_details.sh is directly used

  if lsmod | grep -iq involflt; then
      echo "involflt module is already loaded"
      exit 1

  # ... (rest of the script) ...
  ```
  - File: `/code/validations/image_validator/ASR/scripts/OS_details.sh` (Example of OS detection logic)
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh

  if [ -f /etc/oracle-release ]; then # Attacker can modify /etc/oracle-release
      if grep -q 'Oracle Linux Server release 6.*' /etc/oracle-release; then
          VERSION=`sed "s/[^0-9]*//g" /etc/oracle-release`
          if [ `uname -m` = "x86_64" -a $VERSION -ge 64 ]; then
              OS="OL6-64"
          fi
      elif grep -q 'Oracle Linux Server release 7.*' /etc/oracle-release; then # Attacker can inject command here
          if [ `uname -m` = "x86_64" ]; then
              OS="OL7-64" # If /etc/oracle-release contains "Oracle Linux Server release 7; touch /tmp/pwned", OS will be "OL7-64; touch /tmp/pwned"
          fi
      # ... (rest of OS detection logic) ...
  fi

  if [ $# -gt 0 ]
  then
      echo $OS # Output is used in LoadDriver.sh
  fi

  ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a new directory for the malicious VHD.
  2. Create a dummy `/etc/oracle-release` file with the following content: `Oracle Linux Server release 7; touch /tmp/pwned_vuln`.
  3. Create a dummy VHD image (the actual VHD content doesn't matter much for this test, as we are focusing on configuration files). You can use `qemu-img create -f vpc malicious.vhd 1G`.
  4. Mount the VHD image: `sudo kpartx -a -v malicious.vhd`.
  5. Mount the first partition of the VHD: `sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /mnt`. (Note: Adjust `/dev/mapper/loop0p1` based on your system).
  6. Copy the malicious `/etc/oracle-release` file to the mounted VHD: `sudo cp /path/to/created/oracle-release /mnt/etc/oracle-release`.
  7. Unmount the VHD partition: `sudo umount /mnt`.
  8. Remove the device mapping: `sudo kpartx -d malicious.vhd`.
  9. Upload the `malicious.vhd` to an Azure Storage Account and create a SAS URI.
  10. Update the `azure-pipelines.yml` file with the SAS URI of the `malicious.vhd` and set `enabled: true` for the relevant steps.
  11. Run the Azure pipeline.
  12. After the pipeline execution, connect to the validation VM (using SSH if possible, or check Azure VM's Run Command feature to execute commands).
  13. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_vuln` exists on the validation VM: `ls /tmp/pwned_vuln`.
  14. If the file `/tmp/pwned_vuln` exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.
