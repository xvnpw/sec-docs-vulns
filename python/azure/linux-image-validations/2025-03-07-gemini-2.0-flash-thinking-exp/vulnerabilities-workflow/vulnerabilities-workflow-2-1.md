### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Validation Report
- Description:
    - The validation report generator script `azure-table-data.py` creates an HTML report (`index.html`) to display the validation results.
    - This report includes error messages stored in Azure Table Storage.
    - The `get_report_line` function in `azure-table-data.py` retrieves the `ErrorMessages` from the Azure Table Storage and inserts them directly into the HTML report.
    - The only processing done is replacing newline characters with `<br/>`.
    - If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `ErrorMessages` field in Azure Table Storage (e.g., by crafting a specific image or influencing the validation process to generate error messages containing malicious code), this code will be executed when a user opens the generated HTML report in a web browser.
    - This is because the error messages are not properly sanitized or HTML encoded before being embedded in the HTML report.
- Impact:
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of anyone who views the validation report.
    - This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
        - Cookie theft: Stealing other sensitive cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting users to phishing or malware sites.
        - Defacement: Altering the content of the report page.
        - Information disclosure: Accessing sensitive information accessible within the browser's context.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code only replaces newline characters in error messages with `<br/>` tags before embedding them in the HTML report. There is no HTML encoding or sanitization to prevent XSS.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement proper output encoding/escaping for error messages before inserting them into the HTML report in `azure-table-data.py`.
    - Specifically, apply HTML entity encoding to the error messages to neutralize any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This can be achieved using libraries available in Python for HTML escaping (e.g., `html.escape()` in Python 3.2+ or `cgi.escape()` in older versions).
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the error messages that are written to the `err_msgs.log` file during the image validation process. This could potentially be achieved by crafting a specific type of malicious image that triggers specific validation failures and allows injection of malicious content into the error logs.
    - The generated HTML report (`index.html`) must be accessible to potential victims, for example, if it is hosted in a publicly accessible Azure Blob Storage container (like the `$web` container as suggested in the `upload-logs.yaml` script).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azure-table-data.py`
        - Function: `get_report_line(self, index, image, context)`
        - Line:
            ```python
            if hasattr(image, 'ErrorMessages'):
                err_msg = str(image.ErrorMessages).replace("\n", "</br>")
            else:
                err_msg = ""
            ```
        - Analysis: This code block retrieves the `ErrorMessages` attribute from the `image` object (which represents data fetched from Azure Table Storage). It then replaces newline characters with `<br/>` tags. Critically, it does **not** perform any HTML encoding or sanitization of the `err_msg` string before embedding it into the HTML report. This means if `image.ErrorMessages` contains HTML or JavaScript code, it will be rendered as code by the browser, leading to XSS.
    - File: `/code/ansible_image_validation/set_validation_results.sh`
        - This script calls `azure-table-data.py` with the `--method "generate-report"` argument, which triggers the report generation functionality.
        - The error messages displayed in the report originate from files like `./validation_results/$IMAGE_NAME/tmp/err/err_msgs.log`, which are populated by the Ansible validation playbooks.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare an XSS payload. For example: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
    2. Modify the Ansible playbook `validation-playbooks/per-vm-validation.yaml` to inject the XSS payload into the error log file. Add the following task at the beginning of the `tasks` section:
        ```yaml
        - name: Inject XSS payload into error log
          copy:
            dest: /tmp/err/err_msgs.log
            content: "<script>alert(\"XSS Vulnerability\");</script>"
            force: yes
        ```
    3. Run the validation pipeline using `ansible_image_validation/validate-filtered-images.sh`. This will execute the modified playbook and generate validation logs, including the injected XSS payload in `err_msgs.log`.
    4. After the validation pipeline completes, the HTML report `index.html` will be generated and uploaded to the `$web` container in the configured Azure Storage Account (if configured in `upload-logs.yaml`).
    5. Access the generated `index.html` report through a web browser by navigating to the URL of the `$web` container's index blob (e.g., `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/$web/index.html`).
    6. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears in the browser. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the XSS vulnerability is present, as the injected JavaScript code from the error message was executed by the browser when rendering the HTML report.
