- **Vulnerability Name:** Susceptibility to Adversarial Evasion Attacks
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can craft adversarial examples by subtly modifying malware samples to evade detection by the machine learning models used in the competition.
    2. The provided `attacker` sample code demonstrates techniques to achieve this evasion by modifying PE files in functionality-preserving ways, such as adding benign sections, imports, overlay data, or modifying timestamps.
    3. The `attacker` code uses optimization algorithms (HyperOpt with TPE) to search for modifications that minimize the model's maliciousness score, effectively bypassing the detection threshold.
    4. By iteratively querying the ML models (either locally or via the online API) and refining the modifications, the attacker can generate malware variants that are classified as benign by the models, while retaining their malicious functionality.
- **Impact:**
    - Successful evasion allows malicious samples to bypass security systems relying on vulnerable machine learning models.
    - In a real-world scenario, this could lead to malware infections, data breaches, or other security incidents if such models are deployed as part of a security product.
    - The competition itself is designed to highlight this vulnerability, demonstrating the potential for attackers to bypass ML-based malware detection.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `defender` sample code includes a `StatefulNNEmberModel` which attempts to mitigate evasion attacks by incorporating a stateful nearest-neighbor detection mechanism.
    - This stateful defense tracks previously seen malicious samples and flags new samples as potentially malicious if they are benign according to the base Ember model but are "close" to previously seen malware in feature space.
    - The `StatefulNNEmberModel` uses a trimmed version of the PE file for nearest neighbor comparison, focusing on byte-level features to detect modifications like section additions or overlay appending.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The stateful defense in `StatefulNNEmberModel` is a basic example and may be bypassed by more sophisticated adversarial attacks.
    - The project does not implement more advanced defense techniques such as adversarial training, input sanitization, or ensemble methods, which could further improve robustness against evasion attacks.
    - There is no mechanism to automatically update or adapt the defense model in response to new evasion techniques discovered by attackers.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs access to the machine learning model being used for malware detection, either directly (black-box offline attack) or indirectly via an API (black-box online attack).
    - The attacker needs to have malware samples they wish to evade detection for.
    - The attacker may benefit from having access to benign PE files to extract content for functionality-preserving modifications.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/attacker/attacker/attacker.py`**:
        - The `HyperOptAttacker.attack` method uses `hyperopt.fmin` to optimize file modifications.
        - The search space (`self.space`) includes options to modify sections (`section_info`), imports (`import_info`), overlay (`overlay_info`), and timestamp (`modify_timestamp`), as well as UPX unpacking (`upx_unpack`).
        - The `modify` function within `attack` uses `PEFileModifier` to apply these modifications to a given byte stream.
        - The objective function `f` evaluates the modified sample using `self.classifier.predict_models` and returns a loss based on the prediction scores. The goal of the optimization is to minimize this loss (make the sample appear benign).
    - **`/code/attacker/attacker/utils/modify.py`**:
        - The `PEFileModifier` class implements functionality-preserving modifications to PE files using the `lief` library.
        - Methods like `add_section`, `add_imports`, `append_overlay`, and `set_timestamp` allow for controlled modifications of PE file structure and content.
        - The `upx_unpack` method attempts to unpack UPX packed executables, which can be useful for attacking models that are sensitive to packing.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Deploy the `defender` sample code as a service according to the `defender/README.md` instructions. Ensure it is running and accessible (e.g., at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
    2. **Prepare Attacker Environment:** Install the `attacker` sample code requirements as described in `attacker/README.md`. Obtain benign PE files and malware samples. Get an `api_token` from `https://mlsec.io/myuser/` (if testing online attack).
    3. **Initialize Attack Configuration:** Run the `attacker init` command as described in `attacker/README.md` to create a config file (`config.pkl`), pointing to the benign file folder and using the `api_token`.
    4. **Run Offline Attack:** Execute the `attacker run` command, pointing to the `config.pkl` file, a malware sample (e.g., from `MLSEC_samples.zip`), output folders for success and failure cases, and a limited number of evaluations (`--max-evals 10`). Do not use the `--online` flag for offline attack.
        ```bash
        python -m attacker.attacker run --config config.pkl --samples ~/data/MLSEC_samples.zip --success_out pass1/success --failure_out pass1/failure --max-evals 10
        ```
    5. **Verify Evasion:** After the attack completes, check the `pass1/success` folder. It should contain modified versions of the malware samples that successfully evaded the local `defender` model.
    6. **Test Evasive Samples:** Submit the original malware sample and the generated evasive sample from `pass1/success` to the running `defender` service using `curl`.
        - Original Malware (should be detected as malicious - result: 1):
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @/path/to/original_malware_sample http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
        - Evasive Sample (should be classified as benign - result: 0):
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @pass1/success/original_malware_sample_name http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
    7. **Expected Result:** The original malware sample should be classified as malicious (`{"result": 1}`), while the modified sample in `pass1/success` should be classified as benign (`{"result": 0}`), demonstrating successful evasion of the ML model using the provided attacker code.

This vulnerability highlights the fundamental challenge in machine learning security: the susceptibility of models to adversarial examples, which can be crafted using techniques demonstrated in this project. The provided sample code effectively showcases how attackers can leverage these techniques to bypass ML-based malware detection systems.
