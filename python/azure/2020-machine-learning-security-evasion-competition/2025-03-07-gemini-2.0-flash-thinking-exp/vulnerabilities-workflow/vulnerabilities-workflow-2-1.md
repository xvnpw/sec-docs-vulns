### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Stateful Defender History Pollution leading to False Positives
* Description:
    * Step 1: An attacker crafts a series of slightly modified malware samples. These samples are designed to be detected as malicious by the base Ember model, ensuring they are added to the `malicious_queries` history of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`. These samples are crafted to have trimmed feature representations that are close to those of benign files.
    * Step 2: The attacker submits these crafted malware samples to the defended service. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` correctly identifies them as malicious and adds their trimmed feature vectors to its history.
    * Step 3: After submitting a sufficient number of these crafted samples, the `malicious_queries` history becomes polluted with feature vectors that are close to benign samples.
    * Step 4: The attacker submits a genuinely benign file to the defended service.
    * Step 5: The `StatefulNNEmberModel`'s `predict` function first checks the base Ember model, which might classify the benign file as benign.
    * Step 6: The defender then trims the benign file using `TrimPEFile`.
    * Step 7: The defender calculates the nearest neighbor distance between the trimmed feature vector of the benign file and the feature vectors in the polluted `malicious_queries` history.
    * Step 8: Due to the history pollution, the nearest neighbor distance is likely to be below the `ball_thresh` (0.25 by default).
    * Step 9: The `StatefulNNEmberModel` incorrectly flags the genuinely benign file as malicious, resulting in a false positive.
* Impact:
    * Legitimate benign files can be misclassified as malicious, disrupting normal operations and potentially causing users to lose access to safe software. This undermines the reliability and usability of the defended system.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The `StatefulNNEmberModel` implements a stateful defense mechanism by keeping a history of malicious queries and comparing new samples against this history based on nearest neighbor distance in a trimmed feature space. This mechanism is intended to detect adversarial evasion attempts. However, as demonstrated by this vulnerability, the current implementation is susceptible to history pollution attacks.
    * Location: `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel` class.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input Validation and Sanitization for History: Implement mechanisms to validate and sanitize the samples added to the `malicious_queries` history. This could involve techniques to detect and prevent the addition of samples specifically crafted for history pollution, such as anomaly detection on the feature vectors being added to the history or limiting the types of samples that contribute to the history.
    * History Management Policies: Implement more robust history management policies, such as limiting the size of the history, implementing a time-based decay for history entries, or using clustering techniques to represent the history more compactly and resiliently against pollution.
    * Feature Space Robustness: Enhance the feature space used for nearest neighbor comparison to be more robust against adversarial manipulations. This might involve using different feature types, feature selection methods, or dimensionality reduction techniques that are less susceptible to the types of modifications attackers can make.
    * Dynamic Thresholding: Instead of a fixed `ball_thresh`, implement a dynamic threshold that adapts based on the characteristics of the history and incoming samples. This could make the system more resilient to changes in the distribution of malicious and benign samples and potentially mitigate the impact of history pollution.
* Preconditions:
    * The `StatefulNNEmberModel` is deployed as the malware detection service.
    * An attacker has the ability to submit multiple samples to the service.
    * The attacker has some understanding of the feature space and the `ball_thresh` parameter of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * In `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py`, the `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict` method contains the logic for stateful detection:
    ```python
    def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
        score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
        trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez)
        trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez)
        trimmed_features = self.features

        if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh:
            self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score))
            while len(self.malicious_queries) > self.max_history:
                self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))

        elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0:
            t = AnnoyIndex(self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE, 'manhattan')
            for i, (m, _) in enumerate(self.malicious_queries):
                t.add_item(i, m)
            t.build(20)
            q = trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]
            nn_ix = t.get_nns_by_vector(q, 10)

            dists = [np.linalg.norm(self.malicious_queries[ix][0] - q, 1) for ix in nn_ix]
            min_dist = min(dists)

            if min_dist < self.ball_thresh:
                logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                score = 1

        result = int(score > self.thresh)
        logging.info(f'result: {result}')
        return result
    ```
    * The vulnerability lies in the fact that any sample classified as malicious (even slightly) by either the base Ember model or trimmed Ember model adds its trimmed feature vector to `self.malicious_queries` without any further validation. An attacker can exploit this by submitting samples that are intentionally crafted to pollute this history. When a benign file is submitted later, its trimmed features might be close to the polluted history, causing a false positive.

* Security Test Case:
    * Step 1: Prepare a benign PE file (e.g., a clean `putty.exe`). Let's call it `benign.exe`.
    * Step 2: Prepare a set of crafted malware samples. These samples should be slightly modified versions of real malware or carefully constructed PE files that are detected as malicious by the base Ember model, but their trimmed feature vectors should be engineered to be close to the trimmed feature vector of `benign.exe`. For simplicity, let's assume we have a script to generate such samples. Let's call these `polluting_malware_1.exe`, `polluting_malware_2.exe`, ..., `polluting_malware_N.exe`.
    * Step 3: Start the defender service running the `StatefulNNEmberModel`.
    * Step 4: Submit `polluting_malware_1.exe`, `polluting_malware_2.exe`, ..., `polluting_malware_N.exe` one by one to the defender service via `curl -XPOST --data-binary @polluting_malware_i.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.  Ensure that these submissions are successful (HTTP 200 OK and response `{"result": 1}`). This populates the `malicious_queries` history.
    * Step 5: Submit `benign.exe` to the defender service via `curl -XPOST --data-binary @benign.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.
    * Step 6: Check the response from the defender service. If the response is `{"result": 1}`, it indicates a false positive, and the state pollution vulnerability is confirmed. If the response is `{"result": 0}`, the vulnerability is not exploitable with the crafted samples used in this test, or the parameters need adjustment, or the vulnerability is not present as hypothesized.
