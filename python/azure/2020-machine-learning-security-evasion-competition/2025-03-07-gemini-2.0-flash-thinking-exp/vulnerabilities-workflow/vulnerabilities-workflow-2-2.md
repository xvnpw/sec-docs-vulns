### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Handling of API Token in Command-Line Arguments

- Description:
    The API token, used for authenticating with the online ML service, is passed as a command-line argument to the `attacker.py` scripts (`init` and `run` commands). Command-line arguments are often logged in shell history files and system process listings, making the API token potentially accessible to unauthorized users or processes on the system where the attacker scripts are executed. An attacker gaining access to the shell history or process listing could potentially extract the API token.

- Impact:
    If an attacker gains access to the API token, they can impersonate the legitimate user and perform actions authorized for that user on the ML service. This could include submitting malware samples for analysis, downloading results, and potentially impacting the user's competition score or API usage quota. In the context of the competition, this could lead to unfair advantages or manipulation of the leaderboard.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No mitigations are implemented in the provided project code to prevent API token exposure through command-line arguments.

- Missing Mitigations:
    The API token should not be passed as a command-line argument. Instead, it should be retrieved from a more secure source, such as:
    - Environment variables: API tokens can be stored in environment variables, which are generally less likely to be logged in command history.
    - Secure configuration files: API tokens can be stored in configuration files with restricted read permissions, accessible only to the user running the script.
    - Secure vault or credential management systems: For more robust security, especially in production environments (though not strictly necessary for this competition sample code), a secure vault or credential management system could be used to store and retrieve API tokens.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker uses the provided `attacker.py` scripts (`init` or `run` commands).
    - The attacker executes these scripts in an environment where shell history is enabled and accessible, or where process listings can be viewed by other users or processes.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/attacker/attacker/__main__.py`
    2. **Function:** `init(benign, api_token, o)` and `run(config, samples, success_out, failure_out, max_evals, local_server, online)`
    3. **Line:** `@click.option('--api_token', required=True, type=str, help='api token')` in both `init` and `run` commands.
    4. **Analysis:** The `@click.option` decorator defines `api_token` as a command-line option. When the user executes the script from the command line, the API token is passed directly as a visible argument.
    5. **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Command Line -->  `python -m attacker.attacker init --benign ... --api_token <YOUR_API_TOKEN> -o config.pkl`
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ API token is here as command-line argument
        ```
        The API token `<YOUR_API_TOKEN>` is directly visible in the command.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:**  Have a Linux or macOS system with shell history enabled.
    2. **Step 1:** Execute the `attacker init` command with a dummy API token. For example:
        ```bash
        python -m attacker.attacker init --benign ~/data/benign/ --api_token test_api_token_123 -o config.pkl
        ```
    3. **Step 2:** Check the shell history file (e.g., `.bash_history` or `.zsh_history` in the user's home directory).
    4. **Step 3:** Open the shell history file in a text editor and search for the command executed in Step 2.
    5. **Step 4:** Verify that the command is logged in the history file and that the `--api_token test_api_token_123` is visible in the recorded command.
    6. **Step 5:** Alternatively, in another terminal, use `ps aux | grep attacker` while the `attacker init` command from Step 2 is running.
    7. **Step 6:** Verify that the process listing shows the command with the `--api_token test_api_token_123` argument visible.
    8. **Expected Result:** The API token `test_api_token_123` is found in the shell history and/or process listing, demonstrating that it is exposed when passed as a command-line argument.
