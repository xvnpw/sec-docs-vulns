### Stateful Defender History Pollution leading to False Positives

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a series of slightly modified malware samples. These samples are designed to be detected as malicious by the base Ember model, ensuring they are added to the `malicious_queries` history of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`. These samples are crafted to have trimmed feature representations that are close to those of benign files.
    2. The attacker submits these crafted malware samples to the defended service. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` correctly identifies them as malicious and adds their trimmed feature vectors to its history.
    3. After submitting a sufficient number of these crafted samples, the `malicious_queries` history becomes polluted with feature vectors that are close to benign samples.
    4. The attacker submits a genuinely benign file to the defended service.
    5. The `StatefulNNEmberModel`'s `predict` function first checks the base Ember model, which might classify the benign file as benign.
    6. The defender then trims the benign file using `TrimPEFile`.
    7. The defender calculates the nearest neighbor distance between the trimmed feature vector of the benign file and the feature vectors in the polluted `malicious_queries` history.
    8. Due to the history pollution, the nearest neighbor distance is likely to be below the `ball_thresh` (0.25 by default).
    9. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` incorrectly flags the genuinely benign file as malicious, resulting in a false positive.
* **Impact:**
    Legitimate benign files can be misclassified as malicious, disrupting normal operations and potentially causing users to lose access to safe software. This undermines the reliability and usability of the defended system.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The `StatefulNNEmberModel` implements a stateful defense mechanism by keeping a history of malicious queries and comparing new samples against this history based on nearest neighbor distance in a trimmed feature space. This mechanism is intended to detect adversarial evasion attempts. However, as demonstrated by this vulnerability, the current implementation is susceptible to history pollution attacks.
    * Location: `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel` class.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * Input Validation and Sanitization for History: Implement mechanisms to validate and sanitize the samples added to the `malicious_queries` history. This could involve techniques to detect and prevent the addition of samples specifically crafted for history pollution, such as anomaly detection on the feature vectors being added to the history or limiting the types of samples that contribute to the history.
    * History Management Policies: Implement more robust history management policies, such as limiting the size of the history, implementing a time-based decay for history entries, or using clustering techniques to represent the history more compactly and resiliently against pollution.
    * Feature Space Robustness: Enhance the feature space used for nearest neighbor comparison to be more robust against adversarial manipulations. This might involve using different feature types, feature selection methods, or dimensionality reduction techniques that are less susceptible to the types of modifications attackers can make.
    * Dynamic Thresholding: Instead of a fixed `ball_thresh`, implement a dynamic threshold that adapts based on the characteristics of the history and incoming samples. This could make the system more resilient to changes in the distribution of malicious and benign samples and potentially mitigate the impact of history pollution.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The `StatefulNNEmberModel` is deployed as the malware detection service.
    * An attacker has the ability to submit multiple samples to the service.
    * The attacker has some understanding of the feature space and the `ball_thresh` parameter of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py`, the `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict` method contains the logic for stateful detection:
    ```python
    def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
        score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
        trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez)
        trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez)
        trimmed_features = self.features

        if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh:
            self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score))
            while len(self.malicious_queries) > self.max_history:
                self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))

        elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0:
            t = AnnoyIndex(self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE, 'manhattan')
            for i, (m, _) in enumerate(self.malicious_queries):
                t.add_item(i, m)
            t.build(20)
            q = trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]
            nn_ix = t.get_nns_by_vector(q, 10)

            dists = [np.linalg.norm(self.malicious_queries[ix][0] - q, 1) for ix in nn_ix]
            min_dist = min(dists)

            if min_dist < self.ball_thresh:
                logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                score = 1

        result = int(score > self.thresh)
        logging.info(f'result: {result}')
        return result
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the fact that any sample classified as malicious (even slightly) by either the base Ember model or trimmed Ember model adds its trimmed feature vector to `self.malicious_queries` without any further validation. An attacker can exploit this by submitting samples that are intentionally crafted to pollute this history. When a benign file is submitted later, its trimmed features might be close to the polluted history, causing a false positive.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a benign PE file (e.g., a clean `putty.exe`). Let's call it `benign.exe`.
    2. Prepare a set of crafted malware samples. These samples should be slightly modified versions of real malware or carefully constructed PE files that are detected as malicious by the base Ember model, but their trimmed feature vectors should be engineered to be close to the trimmed feature vector of `benign.exe`. For simplicity, let's assume we have a script to generate such samples. Let's call these `polluting_malware_1.exe`, `polluting_malware_2.exe`, ..., `polluting_malware_N.exe`.
    3. Start the defender service running the `StatefulNNEmberModel`.
    4. Submit `polluting_malware_1.exe`, `polluting_malware_2.exe`, ..., `polluting_malware_N.exe` one by one to the defender service via `curl -XPOST --data-binary @polluting_malware_i.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.  Ensure that these submissions are successful (HTTP 200 OK and response `{"result": 1}`). This populates the `malicious_queries` history.
    5. Submit `benign.exe` to the defender service via `curl -XPOST --data-binary @benign.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.
    6. Check the response from the defender service. If the response is `{"result": 1}`, it indicates a false positive, and the state pollution vulnerability is confirmed. If the response is `{"result": 0}`, the vulnerability is not exploitable with the crafted samples used in this test, or the parameters need adjustment, or the vulnerability is not present as hypothesized.


### Susceptibility to Adversarial Evasion Attacks

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker can craft adversarial examples by subtly modifying malware samples to evade detection by the machine learning models used in the competition.
    2. The provided `attacker` sample code demonstrates techniques to achieve this evasion by modifying PE files in functionality-preserving ways, such as adding benign sections, imports, overlay data, or modifying timestamps.
    3. The `attacker` code uses optimization algorithms (HyperOpt with TPE) to search for modifications that minimize the model's maliciousness score, effectively bypassing the detection threshold.
    4. By iteratively querying the ML models (either locally or via the online API) and refining the modifications, the attacker can generate malware variants that are classified as benign by the models, while retaining their malicious functionality.
* **Impact:**
    Successful evasion allows malicious samples to bypass security systems relying on vulnerable machine learning models. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to malware infections, data breaches, or other security incidents if such models are deployed as part of a security product. The competition itself is designed to highlight this vulnerability, demonstrating the potential for attackers to bypass ML-based malware detection.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The `defender` sample code includes a `StatefulNNEmberModel` which attempts to mitigate evasion attacks by incorporating a stateful nearest-neighbor detection mechanism. This stateful defense tracks previously seen malicious samples and flags new samples as potentially malicious if they are benign according to the base Ember model but are "close" to previously seen malware in feature space. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` uses a trimmed version of the PE file for nearest neighbor comparison, focusing on byte-level features to detect modifications like section additions or overlay appending.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * The stateful defense in `StatefulNNEmberModel` is a basic example and may be bypassed by more sophisticated adversarial attacks.
    * The project does not implement more advanced defense techniques such as adversarial training, input sanitization, or ensemble methods, which could further improve robustness against evasion attacks.
    * There is no mechanism to automatically update or adapt the defense model in response to new evasion techniques discovered by attackers.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The attacker needs access to the machine learning model being used for malware detection, either directly (black-box offline attack) or indirectly via an API (black-box online attack).
    * The attacker needs to have malware samples they wish to evade detection for.
    * The attacker may benefit from having access to benign PE files to extract content for functionality-preserving modifications.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    * **`/code/attacker/attacker/attacker.py`**:
        The `HyperOptAttacker.attack` method uses `hyperopt.fmin` to optimize file modifications. The search space (`self.space`) includes options to modify sections (`section_info`), imports (`import_info`), overlay (`overlay_info`), and timestamp (`modify_timestamp`), as well as UPX unpacking (`upx_unpack`). The `modify` function within `attack` uses `PEFileModifier` to apply these modifications to a given byte stream. The objective function `f` evaluates the modified sample using `self.classifier.predict_models` and returns a loss based on the prediction scores. The goal of the optimization is to minimize this loss (make the sample appear benign).
    * **`/code/attacker/attacker/utils/modify.py`**:
        The `PEFileModifier` class implements functionality-preserving modifications to PE files using the `lief` library. Methods like `add_section`, `add_imports`, `append_overlay`, and `set_timestamp` allow for controlled modifications of PE file structure and content. The `upx_unpack` method attempts to unpack UPX packed executables, which can be useful for attacking models that are sensitive to packing.
* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup: Deploy the `defender` sample code as a service according to the `defender/README.md` instructions. Ensure it is running and accessible (e.g., at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
    2. Prepare Attacker Environment: Install the `attacker` sample code requirements as described in `attacker/README.md`. Obtain benign PE files and malware samples. Get an `api_token` from `https://mlsec.io/myuser/` (if testing online attack).
    3. Initialize Attack Configuration: Run the `attacker init` command as described in `attacker/README.md` to create a config file (`config.pkl`), pointing to the benign file folder and using the `api_token`.
    4. Run Offline Attack: Execute the `attacker run` command, pointing to the `config.pkl` file, a malware sample (e.g., from `MLSEC_samples.zip`), output folders for success and failure cases, and a limited number of evaluations (`--max-evals 10`). Do not use the `--online` flag for offline attack.
        ```bash
        python -m attacker.attacker run --config config.pkl --samples ~/data/MLSEC_samples.zip --success_out pass1/success --failure_out pass1/failure --max-evals 10
        ```
    5. Verify Evasion: After the attack completes, check the `pass1/success` folder. It should contain modified versions of the malware samples that successfully evaded the local `defender` model.
    6. Test Evasive Samples: Submit the original malware sample and the generated evasive sample from `pass1/success` to the running `defender` service using `curl`.
        * Original Malware (should be detected as malicious - result: 1):
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @/path/to/original_malware_sample http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
        * Evasive Sample (should be classified as benign - result: 0):
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @pass1/success/original_malware_sample_name http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
    7. Expected Result: The original malware sample should be classified as malicious (`{"result": 1}`), while the modified sample in `pass1/success` should be classified as benign (`{"result": 0}`), demonstrating successful evasion of the ML model using the provided attacker code.
