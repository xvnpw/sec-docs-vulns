### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Sensitive Parameter Exposure in Command History/Logs
- Description:
    1. A user executes the `az sapmonitor provider-instance create` command to create a new provider instance of type `SapHana`.
    2. The user provides sensitive database credentials, specifically the `hanaDbPassword`, as part of the `--provider-instance-properties` argument in JSON format on the command line. For example:
       ```bash
       az sapmonitor provider-instance create \
           --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
           --monitor-name $SAP_MONITOR_NAME \
           --provider-instance-name $PROVIDER_INSTANCE_NAME \
           --provider-instance-type SapHana \
           --provider-instance-properties '{"hanaHostname":"...", "hanaDbName":"...", "hanaDbSqlPort":..., "hanaDbUsername":"...", "hanaDbPassword":"<PASSWORD>"}'
       ```
    3. The command-line interface records the entire command, including the password provided in `--provider-instance-properties`, in command history files (e.g., `.bash_history`, command history in Azure Cloud Shell).
    4. System logs or monitoring tools that capture command executions may also log the command with the exposed password.
    5. An attacker who gains access to the user's command history files, shell logs, or Azure activity logs can retrieve the plaintext database password.

- Impact:
    - Exposure of database credentials allows unauthorized access to the SAP HANA database.
    - An attacker can perform actions on the SAP HANA database with the privileges of the provided username, potentially leading to:
        - Data breach and exfiltration of sensitive business information.
        - Data manipulation, corruption, or deletion.
        - Denial of service by locking or crashing the database.
        - Privilege escalation if the compromised user has elevated database permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently takes the password directly as a command-line argument.
    - While the code supports using Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve the password, this is an optional feature and not a default or enforced mitigation against command-line exposure. The code in `custom.py` within `create_providerinstance` function has logic to handle `hanaDbPasswordKeyVaultUrl` and `keyVaultId`, offering a more secure alternative, but the direct password input is still supported and documented as a primary method in `README.md`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Password Input:** Implement secure prompting for sensitive parameters like `hanaDbPassword` instead of accepting them directly as command-line arguments. This could involve using Python's `getpass` module to prevent passwords from being echoed on the terminal and stored in command history.
    - **Discourage Password in Command Line:**  Update documentation (`README.md` and help text in `_help.py`) to strongly discourage providing passwords directly in command-line arguments due to security risks. Emphasize and promote the use of Azure Key Vault for secure credential management as the recommended approach.
    - **Warning Messages:** Add warning messages when the `az sapmonitor provider-instance create` command is used with the `hanaDbPassword` property, explicitly alerting users to the security risks of password exposure in command history and logs.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to gain access to the user's local machine, server, or cloud environment where the Azure CLI commands were executed. This access could be achieved through various means, such as:
        - Compromising the user's account or machine.
        - Accessing shared systems or logs without proper authorization.
        - Social engineering or insider threats.
    - The user must have created a `SapHana` provider instance using the `az sapmonitor provider-instance create` command and provided the `hanaDbPassword` directly within the `--provider-instance-properties` argument on the command line.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `/code/azext_hanaonazure/custom.py`, the `create_providerinstance` function is defined, which handles the creation of provider instances.
    2. The function retrieves `provider_instance_properties` from the command arguments:
       ```python
       def create_providerinstance(
             cmd,
             client,
             resource_group_name,
             monitor_name,
             provider_instance_name,
             provider_instance_type,
             provider_instance_properties,
             provider_instance_metadata=None):
           import json
           properties_json = json.loads(provider_instance_properties)
           # ...
       ```
    3.  For `provider_instance_type == 'SapHana'`, the code checks for `hanaDbPasswordKeyVaultUrl` and `keyVaultId` for Key Vault integration. However, if these are not used, it implicitly relies on `hanaDbPassword` being present in the `properties_json` loaded from the command line:
       ```python
       if provider_instance_type == 'SapHana':
           if 'hanaDbPasswordKeyVaultUrl' in properties_json and 'keyVaultId' in properties_json:
               # Keyvault URL was passed in
               # ... Key Vault logic ...
           elif 'hanaDbPassword' not in properties_json:
               raise ValueError("Either hanaDbPassword or both hanaDbPasswordKeyVaultUrl and keyVaultId.")
       ```
    4. If the `hanaDbPassword` is present in the `properties_json` (which is directly derived from the command-line argument `--provider-instance-properties`), it is used to construct the `ProviderInstance` object without any sanitization or secure handling:
       ```python
       from azext_hanaonazure.modules_sdk.v2020_02_07_preview.models import ProviderInstance
       pi = ProviderInstance(provider_instance_type=provider_instance_type, properties=json.dumps(properties_json), metadata=metadata)
       return client.create(resource_group_name, monitor_name, provider_instance_name, pi)
       ```
    5. The `properties_json` which may contain the plaintext `hanaDbPassword` is then serialized to a JSON string and sent to the Azure API. The vulnerability lies in the initial step where `hanaDbPassword` is accepted as a command-line argument, making it susceptible to exposure.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure Azure CLI with the `sap-hana` extension is installed and configured.
        - Have an Azure subscription and resource group available.
        - Have an existing SAP Monitor resource (`$SAP_MONITOR_NAME`) and resource group (`$RESOURCE_GROUP`).

    2. **Execute the vulnerable command:**
       ```bash
       RESOURCE_GROUP="your_resource_group"
       SAP_MONITOR_NAME="your_sap_monitor_name"
       PROVIDER_INSTANCE_NAME="test-hana-provider"
       HANA_HOSTNAME="your_hana_hostname"
       HANA_DBNAME="SYSTEMDB"
       HANA_DB_SQL_PORT=30015
       HANA_DB_USERNAME="admin"
       HANA_DB_PASSWORD="P@$$wOrd" # Replace with a test password

       az sapmonitor provider-instance create \
           --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
           --monitor-name $SAP_MONITOR_NAME \
           --provider-instance-name $PROVIDER_INSTANCE_NAME \
           --provider-instance-type SapHana \
           --provider-instance-properties "{\"hanaHostname\":\"$HANA_HOSTNAME\", \"hanaDbName\":\"$HANA_DBNAME\", \"hanaDbSqlPort\":$HANA_DB_SQL_PORT, \"hanaDbUsername\":\"$HANA_DB_USERNAME\", \"hanaDbPassword\":\"$HANA_DB_PASSWORD\"}"
       ```
    3. **Check Command History:**
       - Open your shell's command history file (e.g., `.bash_history` for Bash, `Get-History` in PowerShell, or command history in Azure Cloud Shell).
       - Search for the `az sapmonitor provider-instance create` command you just executed.
       - **Expected Result:** The command in the history will contain the plaintext password `P@$$wOrd` (or your chosen test password) within the `--provider-instance-properties` argument.

    4. **Check Azure Activity Logs (Optional, if logging is configured):**
       - Navigate to the Azure portal.
       - Go to the Activity Log for your subscription or resource group.
       - Filter the logs for operations related to `sapmonitor provider-instance create`.
       - Inspect the details of the operation.
       - **Potential Result (depending on logging configuration):** The command or parts of the command might be logged, potentially including the password if command arguments are captured in logs.

    5. **Cleanup (Optional):**
       ```bash
       az sapmonitor provider-instance delete \
           --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
           --monitor-name $SAP_MONITOR_NAME \
           --provider-instance-name $PROVIDER_INSTANCE_NAME -y
       ```

This test case demonstrates that the `hanaDbPassword` provided via command-line arguments is indeed recorded in command history, confirming the vulnerability.
