### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Remote Code Execution via Malicious PDF Upload

- **Description:**
    - An attacker can upload a maliciously crafted PDF document to the KYC application.
    - The backend, upon receiving the document, saves it to a temporary location and processes it using the `pdf2image` library to convert the PDF into images.
    - If the uploaded PDF is specially crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within `pdf2image` or its underlying image processing libraries (like Pillow/PIL), it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    - This occurs because `pdf2image` and PIL, while powerful libraries, have historically been susceptible to vulnerabilities when handling complex or malformed image files, including those embedded within PDFs.
    - Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical.** Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities are considered critical as they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    - This can lead to:
        - **Full Server Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the application server.
        - **Data Breach:** Sensitive customer data stored in the Cosmos DB or Blob Storage could be accessed, modified, or deleted.
        - **Service Disruption:** The application's availability and functionality can be severely impacted, leading to denial of service or data corruption.
        - **Lateral Movement:** The compromised server can be used as a pivot point to attack other internal systems and resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None.**  The provided code does not include any specific mitigations against malicious file uploads or vulnerabilities in document processing libraries. The application directly processes uploaded files using potentially vulnerable libraries without input validation or sandboxing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on the type and format of uploaded files. While the application expects document uploads, it does not seem to verify if the uploaded file is a benign PDF or image file before processing.
    - **Secure Document Processing Environment:** Isolate document processing tasks in a sandboxed environment or container with limited privileges to contain the impact of any potential exploit.
    - **Library Updates and Security Scanning:** Regularly update `pdf2image`, Pillow/PIL, and other dependencies to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement automated security scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    - **Consider Alternative Libraries:** Evaluate and potentially switch to more secure document processing libraries or services that are less prone to vulnerabilities or offer better security features.
    - **File Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of uploaded files to mitigate potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities and resource exhaustion.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The KYC application must be publicly accessible and running.
    - An attacker must be able to access the document upload functionality of the application, which is likely available to any user intending to use the KYC service.
    - The backend server must be running the FastAPI application with `pdf2image` and Pillow/PIL libraries installed for document processing.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/api.py`**:
        - The `/api/analyze` endpoint is responsible for handling document analysis.
        - It receives `id_document` as base64 encoded data and `id_document_name` from the request.
        - The base64 encoded document is decoded: `id_document = base64.b64decode(info.get("id_document", ""))`.
        - The decoded bytes are written to a temporary file: `write_bytes_to_file(id_document, im_fn, "wb")` where `im_fn` is constructed using `id_document_name`.
        - An `IDDocumentProcessor` is instantiated with the path to the temporary file: `doc_processor = IDDocumentProcessor(customer_id=customer_id, doc_path=im_fn)`.
        - The `compare_document_to_database` method of `IDDocumentProcessor` is called to process the document.

    - **File: `/code/code/utils/id_document_processor.py`**:
        - In the `__init__` method, the `extract_document` method is called with the provided `doc_path`.
        - The `extract_document` method checks the file extension of `doc_path`.
        - If the file ends with `.pdf`, it uses `pdf2image.convert_from_path(doc_path)` to convert the PDF to a list of PIL Image objects.
        - `pdf_images = convert_from_path(doc_path)` is the vulnerable line. If a malicious PDF is provided as `doc_path`, `convert_from_path` may trigger a vulnerability during processing.
        - The resulting PIL images are saved to temporary files using `pdf_image.save(fn)`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
        - Set up a testing environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible, including the same versions of Python, FastAPI, `pdf2image`, and Pillow/PIL.
        - Obtain or create a malicious PDF file specifically designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in `pdf2image` or Pillow/PIL. Public resources like exploit databases or security research papers can be consulted for creating or obtaining such files. For testing purposes, start with publicly available exploit samples, or use tools to craft them.
        - Ensure you have access to monitor the backend server (e.g., via logs, network traffic monitoring tools, or a debugging session if possible in your test environment).

    2. **Access the Application:**
        - Access the publicly available instance of the KYC application through a web browser.

    3. **Navigate to Document Upload:**
        - Locate the document upload functionality in the application's frontend. This is typically found in the user interface for initiating the KYC process, likely in a section where users are prompted to upload their ID documents.

    4. **Upload Malicious PDF:**
        - Using the document upload form, select and upload the prepared malicious PDF file. Submit the file as if it were a legitimate ID document.

    5. **Trigger Analysis:**
        - After uploading, initiate the document analysis process. This might involve clicking an "Analyze" button or submitting the form containing the uploaded document. This action will trigger the backend to process the uploaded PDF.

    6. **Monitor Server for Exploitation:**
        - **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic from the server for any unusual outbound connections to external, attacker-controlled servers. This could indicate a reverse shell or data exfiltration attempt.
        - **System Logs:** Check the application server's logs (FastAPI logs, system logs) for error messages, unusual activity, or signs of unexpected process execution.
        - **File System Monitoring:** Observe the server's file system for any unexpected file creation, modification, or deletion in temporary directories or other sensitive areas.
        - **Process Monitoring:** Monitor running processes on the server for any new, unauthorized processes spawned after uploading the malicious PDF.
        - **Response Delay/Errors:** Note if the application becomes unresponsive or returns errors after uploading the malicious PDF, which could indicate a crash or exploit attempt.

    7. **Verify Code Execution (If Possible):**
        - **Out-of-band confirmation:** If the malicious PDF is designed to trigger an out-of-band callback (e.g., DNS lookup, HTTP request to a controlled server), monitor for these callbacks. Successful callbacks confirm code execution.
        - **File creation:** Design the exploit to create a specific file in a known location on the server (e.g., `/tmp/pwned.txt`). Check for the existence of this file after uploading and analysis.
        - **Command execution (in a safe test environment):** In a controlled, non-production test environment, you might attempt to execute commands like `whoami` or `hostname` and check the output to confirm code execution. **Never attempt this on a production system.**

    8. **Confirmation of Vulnerability:**
        - If any of the monitoring steps reveal signs of remote code execution (e.g., successful callbacks, unexpected file creation, server compromise), then the Remote Code Execution vulnerability via malicious PDF upload is confirmed.

    9. **Remediation and Reporting:**
        - Once confirmed, document the vulnerability with detailed steps to reproduce and the observed impact.
        - Prioritize remediation by implementing the missing mitigations described above, focusing on input validation, secure processing environments, and library updates.
        - Follow responsible disclosure practices and report the vulnerability to the project maintainers or security team.
