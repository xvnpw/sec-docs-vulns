### Vulnerability 1: Malicious Code Injection via Repository Compromise

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the GitHub repository `Azure/updatemanagement`.
    2. The attacker modifies the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script within the repository.
    3. The attacker injects malicious code into the script, which could be arbitrary Python code or shell commands.
    4. A user, intending to troubleshoot Azure Update Management, follows the instructions in the `README.md` file.
    5. The user downloads the compromised script using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`.
    6. The user executes the downloaded script with elevated privileges using `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` as instructed in the README.
    7. The Python interpreter executes the compromised script, including the attacker's injected malicious code, with root privileges due to `sudo`.

* Impact:
    - **Complete System Compromise**: Since the script is run with `sudo`, malicious code can execute with root privileges, leading to full control of the affected system.
    - **Data Exfiltration**: The attacker can steal sensitive data from the system.
    - **Malware Installation**: The attacker can install persistent malware, backdoors, or ransomware.
    - **Denial of Service**: Although not the focus, the attacker could also cause a denial of service by modifying the script to consume excessive resources or crash the system.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker effectively gains root privileges if the user was not already root.

* Vulnerability rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - **Access Control**: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file restricts contributions to members of the "Azure Update Management" team, limiting the number of potential attackers with direct write access.
    - **Security Reporting Process**: The `SECURITY.md` file provides a process for reporting security vulnerabilities to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), indicating a commitment to addressing security issues.

* Missing mitigations:
    - **Code Signing**: Implementing code signing for the script would allow users to verify the script's authenticity and integrity before execution. Users could check the signature to ensure the script originated from a trusted source (Microsoft) and hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Checksum Verification**: Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the script in the `README.md` would enable users to verify the integrity of the downloaded script after downloading but before execution. Users can compare the checksum of the downloaded script with the published checksum to detect any modifications.
    - ** 강화된 보안 경고 (Strengthened Security Warnings)**: The `README.md` could include a more prominent and explicit security warning about the risks of downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially with `sudo`, even from seemingly reputable sources. This warning should advise users to carefully review the script's content before execution.
    - **Regular Security Audits**: Implementing regular security audits and code reviews of the script and repository by security experts can help identify and prevent potential vulnerabilities and malicious modifications.
    - **Repository Integrity Monitoring**: Employing tools and processes to monitor the repository for unauthorized changes and suspicious activities can help detect and respond to repository compromises more quickly.

* Preconditions:
    - **Repository Compromise**: The attacker must successfully compromise the GitHub repository and gain write access to modify the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` file.
    - **User Download and Execution**: A user must download the compromised script and execute it, following the instructions in the `README.md`.
    - **`sudo` Execution**: The user is highly likely to execute the script with `sudo` as explicitly instructed in the `README.md`, which is a critical precondition for escalating the impact of the vulnerability.

* Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the Python code of `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` itself. The script's functionality is to perform system checks using subprocess calls, which are generally safe in this context as the commands are internally defined.
    - The core issue is the distribution method and the instructions provided in `README.md`. The script is hosted in a public repository, and users are instructed to download and execute it with `sudo`.
    - An attacker who gains write access to the repository can replace the legitimate script with a malicious version.
    - When a user downloads and runs this malicious script, the Python interpreter will execute all code within it, including any injected malicious commands, with the elevated privileges granted by `sudo`.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization in the script that could be bypassed to inject commands during runtime. The vulnerability arises from modifying the source code itself in the repository.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup (Attacker)**: Assume you have compromised the GitHub repository and have write access.
    2. **Modify Script (Attacker)**: Edit the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` file in the repository. Add the following malicious code at the beginning of the `main` function (or anywhere that will be executed early in the script):
        ```python
        import os
        os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report') # Malicious payload to create a file as proof of concept
        ```
        Commit and push these changes to the `main` branch of the repository.
    3. **User Action (Victim)**: On a Linux system, the victim user follows the instructions in `README.md`:
        ```bash
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    4. **Verification (Victim)**: After running the commands, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report` exists on the system:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report
        ```
    5. **Expected Result**: If the file `/tmp/pwned_by_vuln_report` exists, it confirms that the injected malicious code was executed with root privileges when the user ran the downloaded script with `sudo`. This demonstrates the successful exploitation of the Malicious Code Injection via Repository Compromise vulnerability. If the file does not exist, the test case failed, and the vulnerability is not exploitable as described in this test case (though the vulnerability may still exist if the test case was flawed or the malicious code was not properly injected).
