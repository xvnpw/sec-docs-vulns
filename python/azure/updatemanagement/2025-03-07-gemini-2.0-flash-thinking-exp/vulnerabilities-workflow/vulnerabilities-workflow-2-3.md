### Vulnerability List for updatemanagement project

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Repository URI in `pingRepos` function

* Description:
    1. An attacker with write access to repository configuration files (e.g., `/etc/apt/sources.list` for Ubuntu, `/etc/yum.repos.d/` for CentOS/RHEL, `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` for SUSE) can inject a malicious repository URL.
    2. The attacker modifies a repository configuration file, inserting a malicious URL as a repository base URL. This malicious URL contains a shell command injection payload, such as backticks or `$(...)`. For example, for Ubuntu, they could add a line in `/etc/apt/sources.list`: `deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` example.com/repo ...` or `deb http://`"`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`"` example.com/repo ...`.
    3. An administrator, following the instructions in the README, executes the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `sudo`.
    4. The script runs the `check_access_to_linux_repos` function, which internally calls `RepositoryManager.checkRule`, `RepositoryManager.getConfiguredRepos`, and `RepositoryManager.pingRepos`.
    5. `RepositoryManager.getConfiguredRepos` reads the system's repository configuration files, including the attacker's modified file, and extracts the malicious URL.
    6. `RepositoryManager.pingRepos` iterates through the extracted repository URLs and calls `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` for each URL to check network accessibility.
    7. `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` constructs a `curl` command by directly concatenating the repository URI without any sanitization: `unixCmd = "curl --head " + uri`.
    8. The `executeCommand` function executes this command with `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen`. This allows the injected shell command within the malicious URL to be executed. For instance, in the example URL `deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` ...`, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` will be executed by the shell.

* Impact:
    - Critical. If the script is executed with `sudo` (as instructed), successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script does not currently implement any sanitization or escaping of repository URLs before using them in shell commands.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the repository URLs before using them in shell commands. Use proper escaping mechanisms like `shlex.quote` in Python to prevent shell injection.
    - **Avoid `shell=True`:**  Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen` or `subprocess.check_output`. If the shell is necessary, construct the command as a list of arguments and pass `shell=False`. For `curl`, the URL should be passed as a separate argument, not as part of a shell string.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have write access to the repository configuration files on the target Linux system. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities, social engineering, or insider access.
    - The administrator must execute the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `sudo`, as instructed in the project's README file.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability lies in the `RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint` function and the `RepositoryManager.executeCommand` function.

    ```python
    def RepositoryManager.pingEndpoint(self, uri):
        unixCmd = "curl --head " + uri  # [VULNERABLE LINE] URI is directly concatenated into the shell command.
        try:
            (out, err) = self.executeCommand(unixCmd) # Executes the command with shell=True
            ...
        except Exception as e:
            ...

    def RepositoryManager.executeCommand(self, unixCmd):
        proc = subprocess.Popen(unixCmd,      # [VULNERABLE LINE] unixCmd is executed by shell.
                                stdin = subprocess.PIPE,
                                stdout = subprocess.PIPE,
                                stderr = subprocess.PIPE,
                                shell=True      # shell=True enables shell command injection.
                            )
        (out, err) = proc.communicate()
        return (out.decode('utf8', 'ignore'), err.decode('utf8', 'ignore'))
    ```
    - In `pingEndpoint`, the `uri` variable, which is derived from system repository configurations, is directly concatenated into the `curl` command string.
    - The `executeCommand` function then executes this command string using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`. This construction allows shell metacharacters within the `uri` to be interpreted and executed as shell commands, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Set up a test Ubuntu machine where you have `sudo` privileges.
    2. **Modify Repository Configuration:**
        - Edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file using `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` (or your preferred editor with sudo).
        - Add the following line to the file. This line injects a command to create a file `/tmp/pwned` when the URL is processed:
          ```
          deb http://`"`$(touch /tmp/pwned)`"` archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main restricted universe multiverse
          ```
          *(Note: Replace `archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main restricted universe multiverse` with a valid repository if needed to avoid apt errors, the crucial part is the injected command `$(touch /tmp/pwned)`)*
        - Save the changes and exit the editor.
    3. **Download the Script:** Download the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script to the test machine using `wget`:
       ```bash
       sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
       ```
    4. **Execute the Script:** Run the downloaded script using `sudo`:
       ```bash
       sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
       ```
    5. **Verify Command Injection:** After the script execution completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned
       ```
       - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, this confirms that the command injection vulnerability is successfully exploited, as the `touch /tmp/pwned` command embedded in the malicious repository URL was executed with root privileges due to the script running with `sudo`.
    6. **Cleanup (Optional):** Remove the injected line from `/etc/apt/sources.list` and delete the `/tmp/pwned` file.
