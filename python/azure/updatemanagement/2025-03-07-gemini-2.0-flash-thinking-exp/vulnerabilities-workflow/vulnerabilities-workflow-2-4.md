- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Script Download and Execution
- Description:
    1. A threat actor compromises the raw URL hosting the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script on GitHub. This could be achieved by compromising an authorized account, exploiting a vulnerability in GitHub's raw content serving mechanism (less likely), or through a man-in-the-middle attack (if HTTPS is not enforced or circumvented, though raw.githubusercontent.com uses HTTPS).
    2. The attacker replaces the legitimate script with a malicious version containing arbitrary commands.
    3. A user, intending to troubleshoot Azure Update Management, follows the instructions in the `README.md` file.
    4. The `README.md` instructs the user to download the script using `wget` directly from the raw GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`.
    5. The user then executes the downloaded script using `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` to gain necessary privileges for troubleshooting tasks, as implied by the script's functionality (system checks, log access etc.).
    6. Because the script is executed with `sudo`, the malicious code provided by the attacker runs with root privileges on the user's Linux system.
- Impact:
    - Complete system compromise.
    - The attacker gains root-level access to the user's Linux system.
    - Potential for data exfiltration, malware installation, system disruption, or use of the compromised system as part of a botnet.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None directly within the project to prevent malicious script execution from a compromised raw URL.
    - The `SECURITY.md` file provides instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities to MSRC, but this is a reactive measure and does not prevent the initial exploitation.
    - The `CONTRIBUTING.md` restricts contributions to team members, aiming to reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications, but it doesn't prevent account compromise or other attack vectors on the hosting platform.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure Distribution Mechanism: Implement a more secure distribution method for the troubleshooting script than directly hosting it on a raw GitHub URL. Consider:
        - Using GitHub Releases to package scripts with checksums for integrity verification.
        - Publishing the script through a package manager if applicable.
        - Hosting the script on a dedicated, secured infrastructure with access controls and monitoring.
    - Code Signing: Digitally sign the script so users can verify the script's origin and integrity before execution. This would require users to have the public key and verification process documented.
    - README Warning: Add a prominent security warning to the `README.md` file, explicitly cautioning users against downloading and executing scripts directly from raw URLs, especially with `sudo`. Recommend verifying the script's integrity and source through alternative channels if available. Suggest users to review the script's content before execution.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the script hosted at the raw GitHub URL.
    - The user must follow the instructions in `README.md` and execute the downloaded script with `sudo`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `README.md` file provides the vulnerable instruction: `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` followed by `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`.
    - The script itself (`UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`) is a Python script designed for troubleshooting Azure Update Management on Linux. While the script's code performs various system checks and operations, the primary vulnerability lies in the insecure distribution method described in `README.md`.
    - There is no mechanism within the provided project files to verify the integrity or authenticity of the script downloaded from the raw URL.
    - The script, when executed with `sudo`, has root privileges, which amplifies the impact of executing a malicious version.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup (Attacker):**
        - On a separate attacker-controlled system, prepare a malicious Python script (`malicious_script.py`) that simulates a harmful action (e.g., create a backdoor user, create a file in a protected directory, attempt to exfiltrate dummy data). For example:
          ```python
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          import os

          print("WARNING: This is a malicious script!")
          os.system('echo "Malicious script executed" > /tmp/ATTACK_DETECTED')
          os.system('useradd -o -u 0 -g root backdoor_user') # Example of a more harmful action - requires careful testing in isolated env.
          print("Malicious actions completed.")
          ```
        - **Simulate Compromise:**  *(In a real ethical hacking scenario, you would not actually compromise a legitimate repository. For testing, you can simulate this by either setting up a test GitHub repository or by locally hosting the malicious script and modifying the wget URL for testing purposes only.)*  For this test case, we will assume we can replace the script at the raw URL.  **Replace the content of `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` in the main branch of the repository (or a test branch) with the content of `malicious_script.py`.**

    2. **Action (User):**
        - On a test Linux system, follow the instructions from the `README.md` in the repository:
          ```bash
          sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py -O UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py # Explicitly name output to ensure overwrite in case of prior download
          sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
          ```

    3. **Verification (User/Tester):**
        - **Check for malicious activity:**
            - Verify that the `/tmp/ATTACK_DETECTED` file exists and contains "Malicious script executed".
            - **If the more harmful action was included (backdoor user creation - use with extreme caution and in a controlled test environment):** Attempt to switch to the `backdoor_user` using `su backdoor_user`. If successful, the malicious script achieved root-level code execution.
        - **Examine logs (if applicable in the malicious script):** Check for any logs generated by the malicious script indicating successful execution of attacker commands.
        - **System state:** More broadly, assess the test system for any other unauthorized changes or actions that the malicious script was designed to perform.

This test case demonstrates that by compromising the script at the raw URL, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on systems where users follow the provided instructions to download and run the troubleshooting script.
