### Vulnerability 1: Jinja2 Template Injection in YAML Configuration Files

* Description:
    1. The project utilizes Jinja2 templating to dynamically modify YAML configuration files located in the `/code/scripts` directory (e.g., `lora_finetune_phi3.yaml`, `evaluation_phi3.yaml`, `quant_phi3.yaml`).
    2. Scripts such as `launcher_single.py`, `launcher_distributed.py`, `launcher_single_kd.py`, and `launcher_distributed_kd.py` read these YAML files as Jinja2 templates.
    3. These templates are rendered using predefined variables within the scripts, such as `train_path`, `log_dir`, `model_dir`, `model_output_dir`, and `metric_logger`.
    4. While the current implementation uses fixed and internally controlled variables for rendering, a potential vulnerability exists if these scripts were modified to accept user-controlled inputs for template rendering without proper sanitization.
    5. If an attacker could influence the values used in the `template.render()` function in Jinja2, they could inject malicious Jinja2 template code into the YAML files.
    6. Upon execution of the launcher scripts, the injected malicious code would be processed by the Jinja2 engine, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the Azure ML environment.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the Azure ML compute instance.
    - An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the training environment.
    - Potential for data exfiltration, modification of training processes, or denial of service within the Azure ML environment.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
    - The vulnerability is currently not directly exploitable by external users in the provided project as the template variables are internally controlled.
    - However, it represents a significant risk if the scripts are adapted or extended in a way that incorporates user-provided inputs into the Jinja2 template rendering process without proper sanitization.
    - If exploited, the impact is high, leading to arbitrary code execution.

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently uses Jinja2 templating without input sanitization.
    - The variables used for rendering (`train_path`, `log_dir`, `model_dir`, `model_output_dir`, `metric_logger`) are internally defined within the launcher scripts and are not directly derived from external user inputs in the current project setup.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: If user-provided inputs are intended to be used for Jinja2 template rendering in future modifications, rigorous sanitization of these inputs is crucial to prevent template injection attacks.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the Azure ML compute instance and associated service principal have only the necessary permissions to minimize the impact of potential arbitrary code execution.
    - Alternative configuration methods: Consider using safer configuration methods that avoid dynamic template rendering based on external inputs, such as programmatically constructing configurations in Python or using dedicated configuration management libraries with built-in security features.

* Preconditions:
    - For the vulnerability to be exploitable, the launcher scripts would need to be modified to accept and use user-controlled inputs for Jinja2 template rendering.
    - An attacker would need to find a way to influence these user-controlled inputs.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/scripts/launcher_single.py` (and similar launcher scripts)
    - **Code Block:**
    ```python
    jinja_env = jinja2.Environment()
    template = jinja_env.from_string(Path(args.tune_finetune_yaml).open().read())
    # ...
    Path(args.tune_finetune_yaml).open("w").write(
        template.render(
            train_path=train_path,
            log_dir=args.log_dir,
            model_dir=args.model_dir,
            model_output_dir=args.model_output_dir,
            metric_logger=metric_logger,
        )
    )
    ```
    - The `jinja2.Environment()` initializes the Jinja2 templating engine.
    - `jinja_env.from_string(Path(args.tune_finetune_yaml).open().read())` reads the content of the YAML file specified by `args.tune_finetune_yaml` and treats it as a Jinja2 template.
    - `template.render(...)` renders the template using the provided variables. Currently, these variables (`train_path`, `log_dir`, etc.) are derived from script arguments and internal logic, not directly from external user input.
    - If the values passed to `template.render()` were to include unsanitized user inputs, a Jinja2 template injection vulnerability would be present.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Modify `launcher_single.py` to introduce a user-controlled input for Jinja2 rendering.** For example, add a new command-line argument `--inject_string` and modify the `template.render()` call to include this argument:
    ```python
    parser.add_argument("--inject_string", type=str, default="") # Add new argument
    # ...
    args = parser.parse_known_args()
    # ...
    Path(args.tune_finetune_yaml).open("w").write(
        template.render(
            train_path=train_path,
            log_dir=args.log_dir,
            model_dir=args.model_dir,
            model_output_dir=args.model_output_dir,
            metric_logger=metric_logger,
            user_input=args.inject_string # Pass user input to template
        )
    )
    ```
    2. **Modify a YAML file** (e.g., `scripts/lora_finetune_phi3.yaml`) to include a Jinja2 template injection point that uses the new `user_input` variable. For example, modify the `output_dir` in the `checkpointer` section:
    ```yaml
    checkpointer:
      _component_: torchtune.training.FullModelHFCheckpointer
      checkpoint_dir: {{model_dir}}
      # ...
      output_dir: "{{user_input}}"  # Injection point using user_input
      model_type: PHI3_MINI
    ```
    3. **Run the modified `launcher_single.py` script** with a malicious payload in the `--inject_string` argument. For example, to execute the `touch /tmp/pwned_jinja` command:
    ```bash
    python scripts/launcher_single.py --tune_action fine-tune --tune_finetune_yaml scripts/lora_finetune_phi3.yaml --model_dir model --log_dir log --model_output_dir output --hf_token <YOUR_HF_TOKEN> --inject_string "{{os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_jinja')}}"
    ```
    4. **Check for successful code execution.** Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned_jinja` was created on the Azure ML compute instance. If the file exists, it confirms that Jinja2 template injection is possible when user-controlled inputs are incorporated into the template rendering process without sanitization.

**Note:** This vulnerability is currently latent in the provided project as external user input is not directly used in Jinja2 template rendering. However, it is a potential risk if the project is extended to incorporate user-provided configurations without adequate security considerations.
