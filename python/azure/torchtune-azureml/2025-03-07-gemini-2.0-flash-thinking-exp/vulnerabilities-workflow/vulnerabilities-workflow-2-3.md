### Vulnerability 1: Exposure of Azure ML Workspace Credentials in `config.yaml`

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of Azure ML Workspace Credentials

- **Description:**
    1. The project provides a `config.yaml` file located at `/code/config.yml`.
    2. This `config.yaml` file is intended to be modified by users to configure their Azure Machine Learning workspace settings.
    3. The file contains sensitive credentials, including:
        - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`:  Azure Subscription ID.
        - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`: Azure Resource Group name.
        - `AZURE_WORKSPACE`: Azure ML Workspace name.
    4. If a user mismanages this file by publicly sharing it (e.g., committing to a public GitHub repository, sharing via email, or unsecured storage), or if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's local system or private repository where this file is stored, the attacker can obtain these credentials.
    5. With these credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's Azure Machine Learning workspace.

- **Impact:**
    - **Unauthorized Access to Azure ML Workspace:** An attacker can access the victim's Azure ML workspace, potentially gaining control over machine learning resources, datasets, models, and experiments.
    - **Data Breach:**  If the workspace contains sensitive data, the attacker could access, download, or modify this data, leading to a data breach.
    - **Resource Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate Azure ML resources, such as compute clusters, storage accounts, and deployed endpoints.
    - **Financial Impact:** The attacker could utilize the victim's Azure resources for their own purposes, leading to unexpected charges and financial loss for the victim due to unauthorized resource consumption.
    - **Reputational Damage:** If the workspace is associated with an organization, a security breach could lead to reputational damage.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Comments in `config.yaml`:** The `config.yaml` file includes comments such as `# Please modify to your subscription` next to each credential field. This serves as a reminder for users to replace the placeholder values with their actual credentials. However, this is not a security mitigation in itself, and does not prevent credential exposure if the file is mismanaged.
    - **No explicit warnings in README:** While the README.md guides users to modify `config.yaml`, it does not explicitly warn about the security risks of exposing the credentials contained within this file.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Explicit Security Warning in README:** The README.md file should include a prominent security warning about the risks of exposing the `config.yaml` file and the Azure ML credentials it contains. This warning should advise users to:
        - Treat `config.yaml` as a sensitive file.
        - Avoid committing `config.yaml` to public version control repositories.
        - Store `config.yaml` securely and restrict access to authorized users only.
        - Consider using environment variables or Azure Key Vault for managing credentials instead of storing them directly in `config.yaml`.
    - **Code-Level Warnings:**  Consider adding code-level warnings within the scripts that read `config.yaml`. These warnings could be displayed during script execution to remind users about the sensitive nature of the configuration file.
    - **`.gitignore` entry:** Add `config.yaml` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits to version control. While this is a common practice, explicitly mentioning it in the README is beneficial.
    - **Guidance on Secure Credential Management:** Provide guidance in the documentation on alternative, more secure methods for managing Azure credentials, such as using environment variables or Azure Key Vault, and how to integrate these with the project.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. A user clones the `torchtune-azureml` repository.
    2. The user modifies the `config.yaml` file with their actual Azure Subscription ID, Resource Group, and Workspace name to configure the project for their Azure ML environment.
    3. The user then publicly shares or mismanages the `config.yaml` file. This could happen in several ways:
        - **Accidental Commit to Public Repository:** The user might accidentally commit the `config.yaml` file to a public GitHub repository, either their own fork or by contributing to the main repository without realizing the security implications.
        - **Sharing via Insecure Channels:** The user might share the `config.yaml` file via email, messaging platforms, or file sharing services without proper security measures.
        - **Compromise of Local System:** If an attacker gains access to the user's local development machine or private repository where the `config.yaml` file is stored, they can retrieve the credentials.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/config.yml`:**
        ```yaml
        config:
            AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "<YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>" # Please modify to your subscription
            AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: "<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>" # Please modify to your Azure resource group
            AZURE_WORKSPACE: "<YOUR-AZURE-WORKSPACE>" # Please modify to your Azure workspace
            ...
            HF_TOKEN: "<YOUR-HF-TOKEN>" # Please modify to your Hugging Face token
            ...
        ```
        - The `config.yaml` file directly stores Azure subscription, resource group, and workspace credentials in plaintext.
        - The comments `# Please modify to your subscription`, `# Please modify to your Azure resource group`, and `# Please modify to your Azure workspace` indicate that users are expected to replace these placeholder values with their actual sensitive credentials.
        - The file also contains a Hugging Face token (`HF_TOKEN`), which, while less critical than Azure credentials, should also be handled securely.

    - **`/code/README.md`:**
        - The "Get Started" section instructs users to "Modify `config.yaml` with your Azure ML workspace information."
        - It does not contain any security warnings about handling `config.yaml` securely or the risks of exposing the contained credentials.

    - **Scripts in `/code/scripts/` (e.g., `launcher_single.py`, `launcher_distributed.py`):**
        - These scripts are likely to read and utilize the Azure ML credentials from `config.yaml` to interact with Azure ML services.  *(Note: The provided files do not include the code that explicitly reads `config.yaml`. However, it is a reasonable assumption based on the project description and file structure that these credentials are used by the scripts.)*
        - Example scenario (assuming scripts read `config.yaml`):
            1. Scripts would typically load `config.yaml` using a YAML parsing library.
            2. They would then access the `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, and `AZURE_WORKSPACE` values from the loaded configuration.
            3. These values would be used to authenticate and interact with the Azure ML workspace, for example, when creating or managing compute resources, datasets, or deployments.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up a Public GitHub Repository:** Create a new public repository on GitHub (or use an existing one where you are comfortable demonstrating this vulnerability with *dummy* credentials).
    2. **Clone the `torchtune-azureml` Repository:** Clone the `Azure/torchtune-azureml` repository to your local machine.
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Azure/torchtune-azureml.git
        cd torchtune-azureml/code
        ```
    3. **Modify `config.yaml` with Dummy Credentials:** Edit the `/code/config.yaml` file and replace the placeholder values for Azure credentials with *dummy* but realistic-looking values.  **Do not use your real Azure credentials for this test.**
        ```yaml
        config:
            AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Dummy Subscription ID
            AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: "dummy-resource-group" # Dummy Resource Group
            AZURE_WORKSPACE: "dummy-workspace" # Dummy Workspace
            ...
        ```
    4. **Initialize Git in the `code` directory (if not already initialized in your test repo):**
        ```bash
        git init
        ```
    5. **Add and Commit `config.yaml`:** Add the modified `config.yaml` file to the Git staging area and commit it.
        ```bash
        git add config.yaml
        git commit -m "Added config.yaml with dummy Azure credentials"
        ```
    6. **Push to Public Repository:** Push the commit to your public GitHub repository.
        ```bash
        # Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> and <YOUR_PUBLIC_REPO_NAME> with your actual details
        git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_PUBLIC_REPO_NAME>.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
        ```
    7. **Access Public Repository as an Attacker:**
        - Open a web browser and navigate to your public GitHub repository.
        - Browse to the `/code` directory within your repository.
        - Locate and open the `config.yaml` file.
    8. **Verify Credential Exposure:**
        - Observe that the `config.yaml` file is publicly accessible and contains the dummy Azure credentials you entered.
        - If you had used real credentials (which you should not do for a public test), an attacker could now extract these credentials.
    9. **(Optional) Attempt Unauthorized Access (with Dummy Credentials - Expected to Fail):**
        - As an attacker, try to use the extracted *dummy* credentials to authenticate to Azure CLI or Azure portal, targeting the dummy workspace.
        - This step will fail because the credentials are dummy. However, if real credentials were used, this step would demonstrate the attacker's ability to gain unauthorized access to the Azure ML workspace.

This test case demonstrates that if a user were to accidentally commit `config.yaml` with their real Azure credentials to a public repository, those credentials would be easily accessible to anyone, leading to the vulnerability described.
