### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Unintentional Exposure of Connection String via Console Output
* Description:
    1. The diagnostic tool prompts the user to input the IoT Hub device connection string if the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is not set.
    2. The user enters the connection string, and it is displayed on the console as they type.
    3. The tool then performs connectivity checks and prints status messages to the console, such as "Device connection string is properly formatted", "Device connection string components are valid", "Device can resolve Hub IP", and "Device can connect client to IoT Hub".
    4. While the complete connection string is not explicitly printed again after input, the tool's output implicitly confirms the successful parsing and validation of the provided connection string, and successful connection using it.
    5. If a user copies and pastes the console output for sharing or logging purposes (e.g., to share with support or for their own records during troubleshooting), they might unintentionally expose the connection string and its sensitive information (like keys) if they are not careful to redact it from the copied output.
* Impact: Exposure of sensitive IoT Hub or device connection strings. This could allow unauthorized individuals who gain access to the exposed connection string to impersonate the device, send telemetry data, receive commands, and potentially perform other actions depending on the permissions associated with the connection string.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the code. The current implementation directly prompts the user for the connection string in the console and displays it during input. There are no warnings in the code or README.md about the sensitivity of connection strings and the risks of exposing them through console output.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Warning Message:** Implement a clear warning message in the console output when prompting for the connection string, explicitly stating the sensitivity of the information and the risks of unintentional exposure if the console output is shared or logged. This warning should advise users to avoid sharing the console output directly or to redact the connection string if sharing is necessary.
    * **Alternative Input Method:** Consider alternative input methods that are less prone to accidental exposure. For example, reading the connection string from a configuration file or securely storing it in a credential manager instead of prompting for direct console input.
    * **Input Masking (Less Practical for Connection Strings):** While masking the input (like password fields) could be considered, it is less practical for connection strings due to their length and complexity, and users need to see what they are typing to avoid errors.
    * **Reduced Verbosity in Output (Trade-off with Diagnostic Utility):** Reduce the verbosity of the output messages to minimize implicitly revealing components of the connection string. However, this must be balanced against the diagnostic utility of the tool, as detailed output is helpful for troubleshooting.
* Preconditions:
    1. The user runs the diagnostic tool in an environment where the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is not set.
    2. The tool prompts the user to "Input connection string: ".
    3. The user manually types or pastes a valid or invalid IoT Hub device connection string into the console.
    4. The user then copies the console output, or a part of it that includes the input prompt and subsequent check results, and shares this output with others or saves it in a potentially insecure location (e.g., unencrypted log file).
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `/code/main.py`:
        * Lines 80-82 in `main()` function:
        ```python
        conn_str = os.getenv("IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING")
        if conn_str == None:
            conn_str = input("No connection string environment variable detected. Input connection string: ")
        ```
        * The `input()` function in line 82 directly prompts the user to enter the connection string and displays the typed characters on the console screen without any masking or warning about its sensitive nature.
        * The `conn_str` variable, containing the sensitive connection string, is then passed to subsequent functions like `validate_conn_str()` and `client_connect()`. While these functions do not explicitly print the entire `conn_str`, the status messages they generate indirectly confirm the successful processing of the connection string and could allow reconstruction of the fact that a connection string was provided.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
    3. Ensure that the environment variable `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` is not set in your current environment. You can unset it using commands like `unset IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` (Linux/macOS) or `set IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING=` and then `set IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` (Windows).
    4. Run the script by executing `python main.py`.
    5. Observe the prompt: "No connection string environment variable detected. Input connection string: ".
    6. Type or paste a valid IoT Hub device connection string (e.g., `HostName=your-hub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=your-device;SharedAccessKey=your-device-key`). As you type, the connection string is visible on the console.
    7. Press Enter. The script will execute the connectivity checks and print the results.
    8. Select and copy the entire console output from the initial prompt to the end of the script's execution.
    9. Paste the copied content into a text editor or share it as you would in a real-world troubleshooting scenario.
    10. Examine the pasted output. The connection string you entered is clearly visible as part of the interaction log, starting from your input at the prompt. This demonstrates the vulnerability of unintentional exposure through copy-pasting or logging of the console output.
