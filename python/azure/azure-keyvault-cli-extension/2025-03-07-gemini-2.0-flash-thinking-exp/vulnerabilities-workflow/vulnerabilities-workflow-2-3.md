- vulnerability name: Network ACL Bypass Vulnerability
- description: |
    An attacker with some level of Azure access could potentially bypass intended network restrictions and gain unauthorized access to Key Vault resources.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Attacker gains some level of Azure access (e.g., through compromised credentials or insider threat).
    2. Attacker leverages logic vulnerability in the network ACL management preview feature of the Azure CLI extension.
    3. Attacker crafts a specific request or configuration that exploits the vulnerability.
    4. The crafted request bypasses the configured network ACL restrictions.
    5. Attacker gains unauthorized access to Key Vault resources despite network restrictions intended to prevent such access.
- impact: |
    Unauthorized access to Key Vault resources. This could lead to:
    - Data breach: Sensitive information stored in the Key Vault (secrets, keys, certificates) could be exposed to the attacker.
    - Privilege escalation: Attacker might be able to use accessed keys or secrets to further compromise the Azure environment.
    - Data manipulation: Attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the Key Vault.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations: None apparent from the provided files as the vulnerability is in preview features.
- missing mitigations: |
    - Robust input validation and sanitization in the network ACL management feature to prevent bypasses.
    - Thorough logic review of the network ACL implementation to identify and fix any flaws.
    - Security testing, including penetration testing, specifically targeting network ACL bypass scenarios.
    - Principle of least privilege should be enforced in the design of network ACL management feature.
- preconditions: |
    - Attacker has some level of Azure access.
    - Key Vault preview extension is installed and network ACL preview features are enabled.
    - Vulnerable logic exists within the network ACL management feature.
- source code analysis:
    Due to the limited information available in the PROJECT FILES and the vulnerability residing in closed-source Azure backend logic, a direct source code analysis of the vulnerability within this project is not feasible. The vulnerability is described as a logic vulnerability in the preview features for managing network ACLs.
    Therefore, source code analysis would typically involve:
    1. Examining the code responsible for processing and enforcing network ACL configurations within the Azure Key Vault service backend.
    2. Identifying logical flaws in the implementation that could allow an attacker to circumvent intended access restrictions.
    3. Analysing the request handling and validation mechanisms to pinpoint bypass opportunities.
    4. Reviewing code changes introduced in the preview features for potential security regressions.
    Without access to the relevant Azure Key Vault service backend source code, a detailed source code analysis cannot be provided here.
- security test case: |
    Test Title: Network ACL Bypass Attempt

    Description: This test case validates that network ACL restrictions are properly enforced and cannot be bypassed by an attacker with some level of Azure access.

    Preconditions:
    1. An Azure Key Vault instance 'test-vault' is created with network ACLs enabled, configured to deny public access by default.
    2. Specific network access rules are configured to allow access only from a specific virtual network or IP range (intended authorized network).
    3. An attacker has an Azure account with some level of access within the subscription but is not within the authorized network range or virtual network.

    Steps:
    1. Attacker attempts to access Key Vault resources (secrets, keys, certificates) using the Azure CLI with the Key Vault Preview extension installed.
    2. Attacker uses commands that leverage the network ACL management preview features, attempting to bypass the configured network restrictions.
    3. Attacker attempts to perform actions that should be restricted by the network ACLs (e.g., get a secret, create a key).

    Expected Result:
    - The attacker's attempts to access Key Vault resources from outside the authorized network should be denied.
    - The Azure CLI should return an authorization error, indicating that network ACLs are correctly blocking access from the attacker's network.
    - The attacker should not be able to bypass the network restrictions and gain unauthorized access to Key Vault resources.

    If the attacker is able to bypass the network ACLs and access Key Vault resources, the test case fails, indicating a vulnerability.
