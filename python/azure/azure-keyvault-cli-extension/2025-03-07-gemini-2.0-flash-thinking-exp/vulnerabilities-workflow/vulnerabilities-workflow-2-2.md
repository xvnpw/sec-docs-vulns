## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Network ACL Configuration via Azure CLI Extension

- Description:
    1. An attacker could leverage the Azure CLI Key Vault Preview Extension to manage Network ACLs on an Azure Key Vault.
    2. If a user, through misconfiguration or lack of understanding, adds overly permissive Network ACL rules (e.g., allowing access from a broad IP range or all networks), it can lead to unauthorized network access to the Key Vault.
    3. An attacker from outside the intended network range, or even from the public internet if ACLs are set to allow all networks, could then potentially bypass network restrictions.
    4. Once network access is gained, the attacker can attempt to access secrets, keys, and certificates stored within the Key Vault, assuming they also bypass or gain sufficient Azure RBAC permissions.

- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to the Key Vault and its secrets, keys, and certificates. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data access, and potential compromise of systems relying on these secrets.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the extension itself. The extension relies on the user to configure Network ACLs securely.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization in the Azure CLI extension to prevent users from setting overly permissive or insecure Network ACL rules.
    - Clear warnings and best practice guidance within the Azure CLI help text and documentation, educating users about the risks of insecure Network ACL configurations.
    - Security focused examples and test cases that demonstrate secure configurations and highlight insecure anti-patterns.

- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker has network connectivity to the Azure Key Vault endpoint, or can gain it through exploiting overly permissive ACLs.
    2. User has installed and is using the Azure Key Vault Preview Extension.
    3. User has misconfigured Network ACLs using the extension, allowing broader access than intended.
    4. Attacker needs to bypass or gain sufficient Azure RBAC permissions to actually access the vault contents, network access is only the first step.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - I have reviewed the provided project files, but there is no source code included that directly manages Network ACL configurations.
    - The files mainly contain documentation, setup scripts, test recordings, and help text.
    - Based on the file `azext_keyvault/tests/latest/recordings/test_keyvault_mgmt.yaml`, the extension interacts with Azure APIs to set network ACL properties during vault updates.
    - The relevant part of `test_keyvault_mgmt.yaml` shows the following request body for updating a Key Vault with Network ACLs:
    ```yaml
    body: 'b''{"location": "westus", "properties": {"tenantId": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47",
      "sku": {"family": "A", "name": "premium"}, "accessPolicies": [{"tenantId": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47",
      "objectId": "6ff0a69b-8c04-4618-873e-4a1ee85e5296", "permissions": {"keys":
      ["get", "create", "delete", "list", "update", "import", "backup", "restore",
      "recover"], "secrets": ["get", "list", "set", "delete", "backup", "restore",
      "recover"], "certificates": ["get", "list", "delete", "create", "import", "update",
      "managecontacts", "getissuers", "listissuers", "setissuers", "deleteissuers",
      "manageissuers", "recover"], "storage": ["get", "list", "delete", "set", "update",
      "regeneratekey", "setsas", "listsas", "getsas", "deletesas"]}}], "vaultUri":
      "https://cli-keyvault-000002.vault.azure.net/", "enabledForDeployment": true,
      "enabledForDiskEncryption": true, "enabledForTemplateDeployment": true, "enableSoftDelete":
      true, "enablePurgeProtection": true, "networkAcls": {"bypass": "None", "defaultAction":
      "Deny"}}}'''
    ```
    - This shows that the extension allows users to set `networkAcls` with properties like `bypass` and `defaultAction`. If `defaultAction` is set to "Allow" and `bypass` is not correctly configured, the vault could be exposed.
    - Without access to the source code that implements the `keyvault update` command and handles the `networkAcls` parameter, a deeper analysis is not possible from the provided files. However, the risk stems from the user's ability to configure these settings through the extension.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy an Azure Key Vault using the Azure CLI (base CLI, not the extension yet).
        - Configure Network ACLs on the Key Vault to restrict access to only your IP address. Verify access is restricted.
        - Install the `keyvault-preview` Azure CLI extension.
    2. **Vulnerability Trigger:**
        - Using the Azure CLI Key Vault Preview Extension, update the Network ACLs of the Key Vault to set `defaultAction` to "Allow" and `bypass` to "AzureServices".
        ```bash
        az keyvault update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <vault_name> --default-action Allow --bypass AzureServices
        ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - From a machine outside of your initially allowed IP range (e.g., a different network or a cloud VM):
            - Attempt to access the Key Vault (e.g., list secrets):
            ```bash
            az keyvault secret list --vault-name <vault_name>
            ```
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerability):** The command succeeds, indicating that network restrictions have been bypassed due to the insecure configuration set by the extension, and the attacker has network access to the Key Vault.
        - **Expected Result (No Vulnerability):** The command fails with a network access error (403 Forbidden or similar), indicating that network restrictions are still in place, and the insecure configuration was either not applied or is not exploitable in this way.
    4. **Cleanup:**
        - Revert the Network ACL changes to a secure configuration.
        - Delete the test Key Vault and resource group.
