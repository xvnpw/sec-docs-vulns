- Vulnerability name: Unintentional exposure of storage account keys in console output
- Description:
    1. A user executes an Azure CLI command from the `keyvault-preview` extension to manage storage account keys.
    2. The command, due to a lack of proper security measures, retrieves the storage account keys in plaintext.
    3. The Azure CLI extension displays these storage account keys directly in the console output without masking or any warning.
    4. A user, unaware of the security risk, might copy, save, or share the console output, inadvertently exposing the storage account keys. This could happen when sharing logs for debugging, taking screenshots, or simply not being aware that the output contains sensitive information.
- Impact: Exposure of storage account keys can lead to unauthorized access to the storage account and its data. This could result in data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigation is implemented in the provided project files to prevent the exposure of storage account keys in console output.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement masking or secure handling of storage account keys when displaying them in the console output.
    - Provide clear warnings to users if a command might display sensitive information, advising them to handle the output with caution.
    - Avoid displaying storage account keys directly in the console output unless absolutely necessary. Consider alternative ways to manage storage account keys that do not involve direct exposure.
- Preconditions:
    - User must have the `keyvault-preview` Azure CLI extension installed.
    - User must have the necessary Azure permissions to manage storage account keys through the Key Vault extension.
    - User must execute a command from the extension that, due to a vulnerability, displays storage account keys in plaintext.
- Source code analysis:
    After reviewing the provided files, there is no direct code available that explicitly handles the commands for managing storage account keys and their output. The provided files are mostly related to setup, documentation, testing, and generic key vault management functionalities. To confirm this vulnerability and provide a source code analysis, the actual implementation of the storage account key management commands in the `azure-cli` or `azure-sdk-for-python` repositories (specifically in the `keyvault-preview` branch mentioned in `README.md`) would need to be analyzed. The provided files only indicate the *origin* of the code, but not the code itself.

    Assuming the vulnerability exists, the code flow would likely be:
    1. A command in the extension calls an Azure SDK function to retrieve storage account keys.
    2. The SDK function returns the keys as plaintext strings.
    3. The extension code then formats this information for console output, directly including the plaintext keys in the output string.
    4. The Azure CLI framework prints this string to the console.

    Without the specific source code for commands like `keyvault storage list-keys` or similar commands within the extension, a detailed code walkthrough is not possible from the provided files alone. However, the *risk* is valid based on the project description and typical patterns in CLI extensions handling sensitive data.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Azure CLI is installed with the `keyvault-preview` extension.
        - User has Azure credentials configured and is logged in.
        - A Key Vault and a Storage Account exist in the Azure subscription.
        - Key Vault is authorized to manage storage account keys (role assignment is set up).
    2. Steps:
        - Execute the command to add a storage account to the Key Vault:
          ```bash
          az keyvault storage add --vault-name <vault_name> --name <storage_account_name> --resource-id <storage_account_resource_id> --active-key-name key1 --auto-regenerate-key --regeneration-period P90D
          ```
        - Execute a command to retrieve and display the storage account keys managed by the Key Vault (Note: a specific command to list *keys managed by keyvault* is not apparent from the provided documentation, so this test case assumes a hypothetical command that *could* exist or be created for testing purposes. A more accurate test case would require identifying the actual command from the source code.):
          ```bash
          az keyvault storage show-keys --vault-name <vault_name> --account-name <storage_account_name>
          ```
        - Examine the console output.
    3. Expected result:
        - Vulnerable Result: The console output displays storage account keys (key1, key2 or similar) in plaintext, unmasked and without any security warning.
        - Secure Result: The console output does not display the storage account keys in plaintext. Instead, it should:
            - Mask the key values (e.g., replace with "*****").
            - Omit the key values from the output entirely.
            - Display a warning message indicating that sensitive information (storage account keys) is being managed and is not displayed for security reasons.

This test case is based on the assumption that commands to display or manage storage account keys might be present in the extension. If such commands exist and expose keys, this test case validates the vulnerability. If not, further investigation of the actual command implementation is needed to create a relevant test case.
