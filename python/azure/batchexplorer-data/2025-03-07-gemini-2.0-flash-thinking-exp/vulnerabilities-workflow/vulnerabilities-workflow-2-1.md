### Vulnerability 1: Malicious Template Injection

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Template Injection
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker gains write access to the `Azure/BatchLabs-data` repository, which is publicly accessible on GitHub and used as a data source for Azure Batch Explorer templates.
    2.  The attacker modifies a template file (e.g., `job.template.json` or `pool.template.json`) within the repository. This modification can include injecting malicious commands or configurations into the template parameters, task command lines, or other configurable sections of the template.
    3.  A legitimate Azure Batch Explorer user opens the Batch Explorer application.
    4.  Batch Explorer fetches the template data from the `Azure/BatchLabs-data` repository to populate its gallery and template selection interface.
    5.  The user, unaware of the malicious modification, selects and uses the compromised template to create a new Azure Batch job or pool within their Azure subscription.
    6.  When the Batch job or pool is created using the malicious template, the injected malicious commands or configurations are executed within the user's Azure environment. This could involve running unauthorized tasks, accessing sensitive data, or compromising the user's Azure Batch account and potentially other Azure resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of unauthorized Azure Batch jobs within the victim's Azure subscription.
    *   Potential for data exfiltration or manipulation from within the Batch compute nodes.
    *   Resource consumption within the victim's Azure subscription leading to unexpected costs.
    *   Compromise of the Batch account and potentially lateral movement to other Azure resources depending on the permissions of the Batch pool's identity.
    *   Reputational damage to Microsoft and loss of trust in Azure Batch Explorer and related services.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None within the project files provided. The repository is designed to be a data source and does not include any input validation or sanitization for security purposes. The `SECURITY.md` file only outlines how to report security issues, not how to prevent them within this data repository.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Template Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of templates fetched from the repository. This could involve digital signatures, checksums, or a trusted template registry.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Batch Explorer should validate and sanitize all template parameters and configurations before using them to create Batch resources. This should include preventing the execution of arbitrary commands or the injection of malicious code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Users should be educated about the risks of using templates from untrusted sources. Batch Explorer could provide warnings or security prompts when using templates from external repositories or when templates contain potentially risky configurations.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) within Batch Explorer Application:** If Batch Explorer is a web-based application, implementing CSP could help mitigate some forms of injection attacks, although it wouldn't directly prevent the back-end execution of malicious Batch jobs.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker gains write access to the `Azure/BatchLabs-data` GitHub repository. This could be through compromised credentials, insider threat, or a vulnerability in GitHub's access control mechanisms.
    *   A user uses Azure Batch Explorer and selects a maliciously modified template from the gallery.
    *   The user has sufficient permissions in their Azure subscription to create and run Batch jobs and pools.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The provided code files are primarily related to testing the templates and do not represent the Batch Explorer application itself. However, they provide insights into how templates are used and processed.
    *   Files like `/code/runner/Runner.py`, `/code/runner/job_manager.py`, and `/code/runner/custom_template_factory.py` demonstrate how JSON template files are loaded, parsed, and used to create Batch jobs and pools programmatically.
    *   `custom_template_factory.py` includes functions like `set_template_pool_id`, `set_parameter_name`, and `set_parameter_storage_info` which show how parameters within the JSON templates are dynamically modified and used.
    *   The script `/code/ncj/blender/scripts/python-task-manager.py` shows how environment variables (which can be set via templates) are used within tasks to control Blender rendering, indicating potential injection points if these variables are maliciously altered in the templates.
    *   The `installblobfuse.sh` and `setup-linux-pool.sh` scripts within the templates themselves demonstrate that templates can include shell scripts for execution on compute nodes during pool creation or task preparation. This highlights a high-risk area for command injection if these scripts are modified maliciously.
    *   **Visualization:**
        ```
        [GitHub Repository: Azure/BatchLabs-data] --(Template Files: JSON, Shell Scripts)--> [Azure Batch Explorer Application] --(Template Selection by User)--> [Azure Batch Service] --(Job/Pool Creation & Execution in User's Azure Subscription)
        ^
        | Attacker Modification Point (GitHub Repository)
        ```
    *   **Code Snippet Example (Illustrative - not from provided files, but based on analysis):**
        Assume a simplified `job.template.json` contains:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": [
            {
              "commandLine": "/bin/bash -c 'echo Hello, World! && {{user_command}}'"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        If an attacker modifies the template and sets `user_command` to `rm -rf /`, and a user uses this template, the command `rm -rf /` would be executed on the Batch compute node.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Set up a local test environment mimicking the Batch Explorer data repository structure.
        *   Identify a simple template file (e.g., in `/code/ncj/ffmpeg`) to modify. Let's choose `ffmpeg/create-animation/job.template.json`.
    2.  **Malicious Modification:**
        *   Edit the `job.template.json` file. Locate the `commandLine` in the task definition.
        *   Inject a malicious command into the `commandLine`. For example, in `ffmpeg/create-animation/job.template.json` modify the `commandLine` to:
            ```json
            "commandLine": "/bin/bash -c 'mkdir /tmp/attack_test && touch /tmp/attack_test/pwned.txt && {{ffmpeg}} {{inputPattern}} {{outputFile}}'"
            ```
            This command will create a directory `/tmp/attack_test` and a file `/tmp/attack_test/pwned.txt` on the compute node, in addition to the original FFmpeg command.
    3.  **Template Usage:**
        *   Assume you are a Batch Explorer user. Use the Batch Explorer application (if possible in a test environment, or mentally simulate the process).
        *   Select the "FFmpeg" application in the gallery.
        *   Choose the "Create animation from images" action.
        *   Fill in the required parameters to submit a job using this modified template (you can use dummy input data for testing).
    4.  **Verification:**
        *   After the job runs (or even starts running tasks), inspect the compute node (if possible in your test setup, or check task logs for errors if direct node access isn't available).
        *   Check if the malicious command was executed. In this case, verify if the directory `/tmp/attack_test` and the file `/tmp/attack_test/pwned.txt` were created on the compute node. You can check task logs or output files for confirmation if direct node access is not feasible in a real-world scenario.
        *   If the directory and file are present, it confirms that the malicious command injected into the template was successfully executed, demonstrating the vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows for significant unauthorized actions within a user's Azure environment and should be addressed with high priority.
