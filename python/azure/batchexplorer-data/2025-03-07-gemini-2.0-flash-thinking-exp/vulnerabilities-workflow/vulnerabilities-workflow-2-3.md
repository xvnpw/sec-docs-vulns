### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: UI Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) via Malicious JSON Templates
- Description:
    1. An attacker with write access to the repository modifies JSON template files (e.g., within the `/code/ncj/` directory).
    2. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into fields of the JSON files that are intended for display in the Azure Batch Explorer UI, such as 'description', 'name', or parameter descriptions.
    3. When a user opens the Azure Batch Explorer application, it fetches and renders data from this repository, including the modified JSON template files.
    4. If the Azure Batch Explorer application does not properly sanitize the data from these JSON files before rendering it in the UI, the injected malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's web browser within the context of the Batch Explorer application.
    5. This execution of malicious script can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session within the Azure Batch Explorer application.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing user's session cookies to gain unauthorized access to their Azure Batch account.
        - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed within the Batch Explorer UI.
        - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        - Defacement: Altering the appearance of the Batch Explorer UI to mislead or trick users.
        - Actions on behalf of the user: Performing actions within the Batch Explorer application as the logged-in user, potentially including managing Batch resources or accessing sensitive data.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified within the provided project files. The `SECURITY.md` file outlines the security reporting process but does not describe any implemented mitigations against UI injection vulnerabilities.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The Azure Batch Explorer application must implement robust input sanitization for all data fetched from the JSON template files before rendering it in the UI. This should include HTML encoding of user-controlled data to prevent the execution of embedded scripts.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) can further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the sources from which the Batch Explorer application can load resources and preventing the execution of inline scripts.
- Preconditions:
    - Write access to the repository: An attacker needs to have the ability to modify files within this repository. While the repository is described as 'READONLY version of the Batch Extensions templates', the main README indicates it's used to update information for all users without application updates, suggesting that modifications to data files are expected and possible, potentially through pull requests or direct commits by authorized users.
    - Vulnerable Azure Batch Explorer application: The Azure Batch Explorer application must be vulnerable to UI injection, meaning it renders data from the repository without proper sanitization.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Due to the lack of access to the Azure Batch Explorer application's source code, a direct source code analysis of the rendering process is not possible.
    - However, based on the project description and file structure, the vulnerability is hypothesized as follows:
        1. The Azure Batch Explorer application retrieves JSON files (e.g., `index.json`, `job.template.json`, `pool.template.json`) from this repository, specifically from the `/code/ncj/` directory and its subdirectories.
        2. The application parses these JSON files and extracts data to display in the UI. This data likely includes fields like 'id', 'name', 'description', 'parameters', and potentially other template-specific information.
        3. If the Batch Explorer application uses this extracted data directly in its UI rendering logic (e.g., by directly inserting strings into HTML elements) without proper encoding or sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
        4. For example, if the application renders the 'description' field of a JSON template directly into an HTML `<div>` element using innerHTML or similar methods without escaping HTML characters, any `<script>` tags within the 'description' value would be interpreted and executed as JavaScript.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        [Repository: /code/ncj/...] --> (JSON Template Files with potentially malicious content) --> [Azure Batch Explorer Application] --> (UI Rendering - Vulnerable if no sanitization) --> [User Browser] --> (Malicious JavaScript Execution)
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Template:**
        - Choose an existing JSON template file in the `/code/ncj/` directory (e.g., `/code/ncj/blender/render-default-windows/job.template.json`).
        - Edit this file and locate a field that is likely displayed in the Batch Explorer UI (e.g., the 'description' field in the application's `index.json` or a parameter description in `job.template.json`). If `index.json` exists in `/code/ncj/blender/`, modify its description. If not, modify description in `/code/ncj/blender/render-default-windows/job.template.json` or similar.
        - Inject the following malicious JavaScript code into the chosen field:
          ```json
          {
            "id": "test-xss",
            "description": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability in Batch Explorer Template Data!')</script> This template contains a potential XSS vulnerability.",
            "actions": [ /* ... rest of the template ... */ ]
          }
          ```
          or if modifying `index.json`:
          ```json
          {
            "id": "blender",
            "name": "Blender Templates",
            "description": "<script>alert('XSS in Blender Template Description!')</script>Blender templates for rendering Blender scenes.",
            "icon": "blender.svg"
          }
          ```
    2. **Commit and Push Changes:**
        - Commit the modified JSON template file to a branch in the repository.
        - Create a pull request and merge the changes to the main branch (or directly commit if you have direct write access for testing purposes).
    3. **Access Azure Batch Explorer:**
        - Open the Azure Batch Explorer application in a web browser or desktop application if applicable.
        - Navigate to the section of the Batch Explorer UI where templates from this repository are displayed. This might be a "Gallery", "Templates", or similar section.
        - Locate the modified template (e.g., "test-xss" or "Blender Templates" if you modified blender's `index.json`).
    4. **Verify XSS Execution:**
        - Observe the Batch Explorer UI when the modified template is rendered.
        - If a JavaScript alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability in Batch Explorer Template Data!" (or "XSS in Blender Template Description!") appears, it confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability.
        - If no alert appears, try injecting the script into other potentially rendered fields or different template files.
        - Examine the HTML source code of the Batch Explorer UI (if possible in a web-based application) to see if the injected script is present and unencoded.
