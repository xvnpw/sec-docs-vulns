- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via Jinja2 Templates

- Description:
  1. The AutoRest plugin uses Jinja2 templating engine to generate Python code from OpenAPI specifications.
  2. A malicious user could craft an OpenAPI specification that injects malicious Jinja2 code into descriptions, summaries, or other string fields within the OpenAPI specification.
  3. When the AutoRest plugin processes this malicious OpenAPI specification, the injected Jinja2 code is not properly sanitized or escaped.
  4. The `JinjaSerializer` in `autorest/codegen/serializers/JinJaSerializer.py` renders templates, including those for function code (`functions-init.py.jinja2`), model definitions (`model_container.py.jinja2`), and others, by passing data extracted from the OpenAPI specification.
  5. If the injected Jinja2 code is present in the OpenAPI specification and is processed by the Jinja2 rendering engine, it will be executed during the code generation process.
  6. This could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the machine running AutoRest, potentially compromising the development environment or injecting malicious code into the generated Azure Functions application.

- Impact:
  - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine during SDK generation.
  - Malicious code injection into the generated Python Azure Functions application, potentially leading to runtime vulnerabilities in deployed Azure Functions (command injection, data exfiltration, etc.).

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The code does not appear to implement any sanitization or escaping of OpenAPI specification data before passing it to the Jinja2 templating engine.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all string fields extracted from the OpenAPI specification before passing them to the Jinja2 templating engine. This should include escaping Jinja2 syntax or using a safer templating approach that prevents code injection.
  - Templating engine security: Review Jinja2 template usage to ensure that user-provided data is not directly interpreted as code. Consider using context-aware escaping or other security mechanisms provided by Jinja2.
  - Sandboxing: If feasible, sandbox the code generation process to limit the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted OpenAPI specification to the AutoRest plugin, for example by convincing a developer to use it.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/autorest/codegen/serializers/JinjaSerializer.py`
  2. This file is responsible for using Jinja2 to serialize the code model into Python code.
  3. The `JinjaSerializer.serialize()` method calls various template serializers (e.g., `AzureFunctionsPythonSerializer`, `ModelGenericSerializer`, etc.).
  4. These serializers use Jinja2 `Environment` and `get_template` to load templates and `render` to process them.
  5. Data for rendering templates is extracted from the code model, which is built from the OpenAPI specification.
  6. **Vulnerable Point:** The code model and its attributes, populated from the OpenAPI specification, are directly passed to the `render` method of Jinja2 templates without sanitization.
  7. For example, in `/code/autorest/codegen/serializers/azure_functions/python/functions_serializer.py`, the `serialize_functions_init_file` method renders the `functions-init.py.jinja2` template and passes `operation.name` and `operations_description`, which originate from the OpenAPI specification.

  ```python
  # Example from /code/autorest/codegen/serializers/azure_functions/python/functions_serializer.py
  def serialize_functions_init_file(self, operation):
      template = self.env.get_template("functions-init.py.jinja2")

      return template.render(
          code_model=self.code_model,
          request_type="HttpRequest",
          return_type="HttpResponse",
          function_name=operation.name, # Data from OpenAPI spec
          operations_description="Doing operation here", # Hardcoded, but other fields might be from spec
          request_comment_description="Passing the request",
          return_comment_description="Request",
          magic_comment="### Do Magic Here! ###",
          imports=FileImportSerializer(self._get_imports()),
          success_status_code="200",
          failure_status_code="405"
      )
  ```
  8. If `operation.name` or `operations_description` (or other fields from the spec) contain malicious Jinja2 code, it will be executed during template rendering.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a malicious OpenAPI specification (`malicious_openapi.yaml`) with injected Jinja2 code in the description of an operation.
     ```yaml
     openapi: "3.0.0"
     info:
       version: 1.0.0
       title: Malicious Petstore
     paths:
       /pets:
         get:
           summary: List all pets
           description: "This is a test description with code injection: {{import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')}}" # Malicious Jinja2 code
           operationId: listPets
           responses:
             '200':
               description: A paged array of pets
               content:
                 application/json:
                   schema:
                     $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pets"
     components:
       schemas:
         Pet:
           type: object
           required:
             - id
             - name
           properties:
             id:
               type: integer
               format: int64
             name:
               type: string
             tag:
               type: string
         Pets:
           type: array
           items:
             $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
         Error:
           type: object
           required:
             - code
             - message
           properties:
             code:
               type: integer
               format: int32
             message:
               type: string
     ```
  2. Run AutoRest with the malicious OpenAPI specification, targeting the project-stencil plugin:
     ```bash
     autorest --input-file:malicious_openapi.yaml --use:. --output-folder:./output --language:python
     ```
  3. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the system running AutoRest.
  4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the injected Jinja2 code was executed, demonstrating the vulnerability.
