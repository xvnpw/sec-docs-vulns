## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Stateful Nearest Neighbor Model False Positive Vulnerability

*   **Description:**
    The `StatefulNNEmberModel` in `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` uses a stateful nearest neighbor detection mechanism to identify adversarial examples. It stores features of samples classified as malicious. For each new benign sample (classified by the base EMBER model), it calculates the nearest neighbor distance to the stored malicious samples. If a sample is within a certain distance (`ball_thresh`) of a past malicious sample, it's reclassified as malicious, assuming it's an evasion attempt.

    An attacker can exploit this by submitting diverse, genuinely malicious samples to populate the history buffer (`self.malicious_queries`).  Since the history eviction is random, the buffer can become filled with diverse malicious feature vectors.

    Subsequently, a legitimate benign sample might be falsely flagged as malicious.  Even if correctly classified as benign by the base EMBER model, it may, by chance, be close to one of the diverse malicious samples in the history. This results in a false positive due to the stateful nearest neighbor check.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  Register and obtain an `api_token` to interact with the service.
    2.  Prepare a set of diverse, genuinely malicious PE files from different malware families or with significant structural variations.
    3.  Submit each malicious PE file to the defender service API endpoint (e.g., `/`). This populates the `StatefulNNEmberModel`'s `malicious_queries` history.
    4.  Prepare a legitimate benign PE file that is reliably classified as benign by the base EMBER model.
    5.  Submit this benign PE file to the defender service.
    6.  The `StatefulNNEmberModel` classifies it as benign based on the EMBER model.
    7.  The nearest neighbor check is performed against the populated `malicious_queries` history.
    8.  If the benign sample's features are within the `ball_thresh` distance to any malicious sample in history, it will be incorrectly reclassified as malicious.

*   **Impact:**
    Increased false positive rate. Legitimate benign files are incorrectly classified as malicious, reducing the accuracy and reliability of the malware detection system. This can disrupt legitimate user activities, cause unnecessary security alerts, and erode trust in the system.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   `max_history` parameter in `StatefulNNEmberModel.__init__`: Limits the maximum number of malicious queries stored in `self.malicious_queries` (default 10,000). This limits history size but doesn't prevent diverse malicious samples from causing false positives.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Intelligent History Eviction Policy: Implement policies prioritizing recency, relevance/diversity, or confidence score (EMBER score) for eviction instead of random eviction.
    -   Feature Selection for Nearest Neighbor: Refine the feature set for nearest neighbor comparison to reduce false positives.
    -   Dynamic `ball_thresh` Adjustment: Dynamically adjust `ball_thresh` based on the density or diversity of the malicious history.
    -   Benign History/Whitelist: Maintain a benign sample history or whitelist to prevent false flags.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   Ability to submit samples to the defender service.
    -   `StatefulNNEmberModel` in use with stateful NN detection enabled and a non-empty history.
    -   Sufficient diverse malicious samples submitted to populate the history and increase false positive likelihood.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict(bytez)` function:**
        ```python
        def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
            score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
            trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez)
            trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez)
            trimmed_features = self.features

            if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh:
                self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score))
                while len(self.malicious_queries) > self.max_history:
                    self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))

            elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0:
                t = AnnoyIndex(self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE, 'manhattan')
                for i, (m, _) in enumerate(self.malicious_queries):
                    t.add_item(i, m)
                t.build(20)

                q = trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]
                nn_ix = t.get_nns_by_vector(q, 10)

                dists = [np.linalg.norm(self.malicious_queries[ix][0] - q, 1) for ix in nn_ix]
                min_dist = min(dists)

                if min_dist < self.ball_thresh:
                    logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                    score = 1
            result = int(score > self.thresh)
            logging.info(f'result: {result}')
            return result
        ```
        -   Vulnerability: Random eviction policy and no diversity check when adding to `self.malicious_queries` leads to potential false positives.
        -   Features: Uses first 512 features (histogram and byteentropy) from `trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]`.
        -   Nearest Neighbor Check: For benign samples, checks nearest neighbors in `self.malicious_queries` using AnnoyIndex and Manhattan distance. Reclassifies as malicious if `min_dist < self.ball_thresh`.

    **Visualization:** (Conceptual 2D feature space)
    - Malicious samples (M1, M2, M3...) populate `malicious_queries`, spreading across feature space.
    - Benign sample (B) features (f(B)) might fall close to f(M1) by chance.
    - If distance(f(B), f(M1)) < `ball_thresh`, B is incorrectly classified as malicious.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Deploy defender service. Identify a benign PE file (BenignSample.exe) consistently classified as benign. Prepare >= 100 diverse malicious PE files (Malware1.exe, ..., Malware100.exe).
    2.  **Populate Malicious History:** Submit Malware1.exe to Malware100.exe to the service using `curl -X POST --data-binary`.
    3.  **Test Benign Sample after History Pollution:** Submit BenignSample.exe. Check JSON response. `result: 1` indicates false positive.
    4.  **Control Test:** Restart defender to clear history. Submit BenignSample.exe again. `result: 0` should confirm correct benign classification without polluted history.

### 2. Adversarial Evasion via Nearest Neighbor Detector Bypass

*   **Description:**
    The `StatefulNNEmberModel` uses a stateful nearest neighbor (NN) detection mechanism alongside the base EMBER model. If a PE file is benign according to EMBER, it checks for similarity to past malicious samples using byte-level features from a trimmed PE file (histogram and byte-entropy from first five sections and first 128 bytes of overlay).

    An attacker can craft a malicious PE file that bypasses detection by:
    1. Being classified as benign by the EMBER model.
    2. Having dissimilar byte-level features (of the trimmed PE) compared to samples in `malicious_queries` history.
    3. Keeping byte-level features outside the `ball_thresh` distance from historical malicious samples to bypass NN detection.

    This leads to the `StatefulNNEmberModel` incorrectly classifying the adversarial sample as benign (result 0), evading the defense.

*   **Impact:**
    Successful evasion of the malware detection system, allowing malicious PE files to be classified as benign, potentially leading to system compromise. Undermines the integrity of the ML-based defense.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   **Stateful Nearest Neighbor Detection:** `StatefulNNEmberModel` attempts evasion mitigation by tracking past malicious samples and flagging new samples "close" to them (implemented in `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict` in `/code/defender/defender/models/ember_model.py`).
    -   **Feature Trimming:** `TrimPEFile` in `/code/defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` reduces PE file to core components (sections, overlay) to focus on key byte patterns and hinder padding/appending evasion.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Robust Feature Space: Current byte-level features (histogram, byte-entropy) are potentially too sensitive to manipulation. More robust, less manipulable features are needed.
    -   Adaptive Thresholding: Static `ball_thresh`.  Adaptive thresholding based on benign/malicious sample distribution could improve accuracy.
    -   History Management and Curation: Random `malicious_queries` trimming. Intelligent history management prioritizing diverse/representative samples, and removing misclassified benign samples, is needed.
    -   Ensemble of Models: Single model (`StatefulNNEmberModel`) vulnerability. Ensemble of diverse models could increase resilience.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   Understanding of `StatefulNNEmberModel`'s feature extraction and NN detection, specifically `TrimPEFile` and features (histogram, byte-entropy).
    -   `malicious_queries` history should not already contain very similar samples to the crafted adversarial sample.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict(bytez)`:**
        ```python
        def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
            score = self.predict_proba(bytez) # Line 115: Base EmberModel prediction
            trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez) # Line 116: Trim PE file
            trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez) # Line 117: Trimmed PE score (redundant?)
            trimmed_features = self.features # Line 118: Trimmed PE features

            if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh: # Line 124: Malicious score
                self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score)) # Line 125: Add to history
                # ... history management ...

            elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0: # Line 132: Benign score, history not empty
                # ... Annoy index and NN search ... # Line 134-144
                min_dist = min(dists)  # Line 146: Minimum distance

                if min_dist < self.ball_thresh: # Line 148: Distance below threshold
                    logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                    score = 1 # Line 149: Classify as malicious

            result = int(score > self.thresh) # Line 154: Final result
            logging.info(f'result: {result}')
            return result
        ```
        -   Vulnerability: Attackers can craft benign-to-EMBER samples with trimmed PE byte-level features dissimilar to `malicious_queries` history, bypassing NN check.

    2.  **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `TrimPEFile.trim(bytez)`:**
        -   Defines trimmed sections/overlay. Attackers can manipulate PE parts outside these for evasion while maintaining functionality.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Start defender service. Benign & malicious PE files. Empty `malicious_queries` history (restart container).
    2.  **Baseline Test:** Benign.exe -> `{"result": 0}`. Malicious.exe -> `{"result": 1}` (populates history).
    3.  **Craft Adversarial Sample:** Create `adversarial.exe` from `malicious.exe` (e.g., padding, non-trimmed section/overlay modifications) to be benign to EMBER and byte-level dissimilar.
    4.  **Evasion Test:** `adversarial.exe` -> Expected `{"result": 0}` (evasion).
    5.  **Verification:** `adversarial.exe` remains functional malware (sandbox). Compare trimmed `adversarial.exe` features to `malicious.exe` history features; distance > `ball_thresh`.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Evasion through Adversarial Examples

*   **Description:**
    1.  Attacker crafts a Portable Executable (PE) file, starting from a malicious PE file.
    2.  Subtly modifies the crafted PE file to alter features extracted by the ML model (EmberModel) to reduce its maliciousness score.
    3.  Iteratively refines modifications by submitting to the defender service and observing prediction.
    4.  Continues until the modified PE file is classified as benign (result: 0), successfully evading malware detection.
    5.  The adversarial example retains its malicious functionality.

*   **Impact:**
    Successful evasion of the malware detection system. Allows malicious PE files to be classified as benign, potentially leading to system compromise.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   **Stateful Nearest Neighbor (NN) Detection (defender/models/ember_model.py):** Aims to detect subtly modified malware by checking for similarity to historical malicious samples.
    -   **Feature Engineering (ember library):** Ember model uses robust PE features designed against simple evasion techniques.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Adversarial Training: Retrain model with adversarial examples.
    -   Ensemble of Models: Use multiple diverse ML models.
    -   Input Validation and Sanitization: General input validation (though PE files are expected input).
    -   Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection: Robust rate limiting and anomaly detection to slow down/identify iterative evasion attempts.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   Access to defender service endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
    -   Ability to craft and modify PE files.
    -   Knowledge of Ember model features/threshold (helpful but black-box evasion possible).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`defender/defender/apps.py` - `post()` function:**
        ```python
        @app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
        def post():
            if request.headers['Content-Type'] != 'application/octet-stream':
                resp = jsonify({'error': 'expecting application/octet-stream'})
                resp.status_code = 400
                return resp

            bytez = request.data
            model = app.config['model']
            result = model.predict(bytez) # Model prediction
            if not isinstance(result, int) or result not in {0, 1}:
                resp = jsonify({'error': 'unexpected model result (not in [0,1])'})
                resp.status_code = 500
                return resp

            resp = jsonify({'result': result}) # Returns prediction
            resp.status_code = 200
            return resp
        ```
        -   Vulnerable endpoint: Directly feeds PE file bytes to ML model without specific adversarial manipulation prevention. Model's inherent limitations are the vulnerability.

    2.  **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `EmberModel.predict()` and `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict()` functions:**
        -   `EmberModel.predict()`:
            ```python
            def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
                score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
                return int(score > self.thresh)
            ```
            -   Score-based classification with fixed threshold.
        -   `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict()`: (See full code in Vulnerability 1 and 2)
            -   Adds stateful NN check, but core vulnerability remains: `EmberModel` susceptibility to score reduction via adversarial manipulation.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Precondition:** Defender service setup (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
    2.  **Prepare malicious PE:** `original_malware.exe` (e.g., from `MLSEC_2019_samples_and_variants.zip`).
    3.  **Initial Detection Test:** `curl -XPOST --data-binary @original_malware.exe ...` -> `{"result": 1}`.
    4.  **Craft Adversarial Example:** Modify `original_malware.exe` to `adversarial_malware.exe` (e.g., hex edit non-functional bytes, append overlay).
    5.  **Evasion Test:** `curl -XPOST --data-binary @adversarial_malware.exe ...` -> Expected `{"result": 0}`.
    6.  **Verification:** `adversarial_malware.exe` retains malicious functionality (sandbox).
