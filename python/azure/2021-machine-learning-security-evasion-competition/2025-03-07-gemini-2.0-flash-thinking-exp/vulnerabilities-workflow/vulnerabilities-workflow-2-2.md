#### 1. Adversarial Evasion via Nearest Neighbor Detector Bypass

- **Description:**
    1. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` employs a stateful nearest neighbor (NN) detection mechanism in addition to the base EMBER model.
    2. If a submitted PE file is classified as benign by the EMBER model, the system checks for similarity with previously seen malicious samples using byte-level features extracted from a trimmed version of the PE file.
    3. Specifically, it uses histogram and byte-entropy features from the first five sections (up to 64KB each) and the first 128 bytes of the overlay.
    4. An attacker can craft a malicious PE file that is classified as benign by the EMBER model and, crucially, is also dissimilar in terms of these byte-level features to the malicious samples stored in the `malicious_queries` history.
    5. By keeping the crafted sample's byte-level features outside the defined `ball_thresh` distance from the historical malicious samples, the nearest neighbor detection is bypassed.
    6. Consequently, the `StatefulNNEmberModel` incorrectly classifies the adversarial sample as benign (result 0), despite it being malicious, thus evading the intended defense.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful evasion of the malware detection system.
    - Allows malicious PE files to be classified as benign, potentially leading to system compromise if this system is deployed as a security measure.
    - Undermines the integrity of the machine learning based defense.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Stateful Nearest Neighbor Detection:** The `StatefulNNEmberModel` attempts to mitigate evasion by tracking previously seen malicious samples and flagging new samples as malicious if they are "close" to these historical samples in feature space. This is implemented in the `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict` method in `/code/defender/defender/models/ember_model.py`.
    - **Feature Trimming:** The `TrimPEFile` class in `/code/defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` reduces the input PE file to its core components (first few sections and overlay), aiming to focus on essential byte patterns and reduce the effectiveness of simple padding or appending evasion techniques.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Robust Feature Space:** The current byte-level features (histogram and byte-entropy) might be too sensitive to minor perturbations in the PE file, allowing attackers to easily manipulate them to evade detection. More robust features that are less susceptible to adversarial manipulation could be used.
    - **Adaptive Thresholding:** The `ball_thresh` is a static value. An adaptive threshold that adjusts based on the distribution of benign and malicious samples in the feature space could improve detection accuracy and robustness.
    - **History Management and Curation:** The `malicious_queries` history is trimmed randomly when it exceeds `max_history`. A more intelligent history management strategy, possibly prioritizing diverse and representative malicious samples, could improve the effectiveness of the NN detection. Additionally, mechanisms to remove potentially misclassified benign samples from history would be beneficial to prevent false positives from polluting the state.
    - **Ensemble of Models:** Relying on a single model (`StatefulNNEmberModel`) makes the system vulnerable to targeted attacks against that specific model. Employing an ensemble of diverse models with different architectures and feature sets could increase resilience to evasion attacks.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to understand the feature extraction and nearest neighbor detection mechanisms of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`, specifically the `TrimPEFile` and the features used for distance calculation (histogram and byte-entropy of trimmed PE).
    - The `malicious_queries` history in `StatefulNNEmberModel` must not already contain samples that are very similar in feature space to the crafted adversarial sample. If the history is already "dense" with diverse malicious samples, evasion might be harder.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict(bytez)`:**
        ```python
        def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
            score = self.predict_proba(bytez) # Line 115: Predict score using base EmberModel
            trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez) # Line 116: Trim the PE file using TrimPEFile
            trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez) # Line 117: Predict score of trimmed PE file (redundant?)
            trimmed_features = self.features # Line 118: Get features extracted by EmberModel for trimmed PE

            if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh: # Line 124: If either score is malicious (above threshold)
                self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score)) # Line 125: Add trimmed features to malicious history
                # ... history management ...

            elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0: # Line 132: If base model is benign and history is not empty
                # ... Annoy index creation and NN search ... # Line 134-144: Build Annoy index and find nearest neighbors
                min_dist = min(dists)  # Line 146: Calculate minimum distance to nearest neighbors

                if min_dist < self.ball_thresh: # Line 148: Check if minimum distance is below threshold
                    logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                    score = 1 # Line 149: If close to malicious neighbor, classify as malicious

            result = int(score > self.thresh) # Line 154: Final result based on score (could be modified by NN detection)
            logging.info(f'result: {result}')
            return result
        ```
        - The code first uses the base `EmberModel` to predict a score.
        - It then trims the PE file and extracts features from the trimmed version.
        - If the initial EMBER score is benign, it checks the distance to the nearest neighbors in the `malicious_queries` history using the trimmed features.
        - If the distance is below `ball_thresh`, it overrides the benign classification and marks it as malicious.
        - **Vulnerability point:** An attacker can focus on crafting samples that are benign to EMBER and have byte-level features of the trimmed PE file sufficiently different from the samples in `malicious_queries`, thereby bypassing the NN check.

    2. **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `TrimPEFile.trim(bytez)`:**
        - This method trims the PE file, limiting sections and overlay size. This trimming is intended to create a "core" representation for NN comparison, but it also defines the specific parts of the PE file that are considered for this stateful detection. Attackers can potentially manipulate parts of the PE outside of these trimmed sections and overlay to achieve evasion while maintaining functionality.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Start the defender service using `docker run -itp 8080:8080 ember`.
        - Prepare a benign PE file (e.g., a clean utility) and a malicious PE file (e.g., from a malware sample set).
        - Ensure the `malicious_queries` history of the `StatefulNNEmberModel` is initially empty or does not contain samples similar to the adversarial sample we will craft. This can be achieved by restarting the Docker container.
    2. **Baseline Test:**
        - Submit the benign PE file to the defender service using `curl -XPOST --data-binary @benign.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`. Verify the response is `{"result": 0}` (benign).
        - Submit the original malicious PE file to the defender service using `curl -XPOST --data-binary @malicious.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`. Verify the response is `{"result": 1}` (malicious). This step populates the `malicious_queries` history with features from `malicious.exe`.
    3. **Craft Adversarial Sample:**
        - Create an adversarial variant of `malicious.exe` (e.g., by appending benign sections or padding, or by modifying non-trimmed sections/overlay parts if possible while maintaining functionality). The goal is to make it:
            - Classified as benign by the base EMBER model.
            - Dissimilar in byte-level features (histogram, byte-entropy of trimmed sections/overlay) to `malicious.exe` and other samples potentially in the `malicious_queries` history.
        - Let's call this crafted file `adversarial.exe`.
    4. **Evasion Test:**
        - Submit `adversarial.exe` to the defender service using `curl -XPOST --data-binary @adversarial.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.
        - **Expected Result:** The response should be `{"result": 0}` (benign). This indicates successful evasion of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`. If the response is `{"result": 1}`, the evasion attempt failed, and the adversarial sample was still detected (either by EMBER or NN detector).
    5. **Verification:**
        - Verify that `adversarial.exe` remains functional malware (e.g., by running it in a sandbox environment without network access, as suggested in the `attacker/README.md`).
        - Compare the byte-level features of the trimmed `adversarial.exe` with the features of `malicious.exe` stored in the history. Confirm that the distance is greater than `ball_thresh` (or at least large enough to bypass the NN detection).

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can potentially evade the `StatefulNNEmberModel` by crafting adversarial examples that exploit the limitations of the stateful nearest neighbor detection, specifically by manipulating byte-level features of the trimmed PE file to be dissimilar to historical malicious samples while still being classified as benign by the base EMBER model.
