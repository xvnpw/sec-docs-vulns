- Vulnerability Name: Stateful Nearest Neighbor Model False Positive Vulnerability

- Description:
    The `StatefulNNEmberModel` in `defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` employs a stateful nearest neighbor detection mechanism to identify adversarial examples. This model maintains a history of features from samples it has classified as malicious. For each new sample classified as benign by the base EMBER model, it computes the nearest neighbor distance to samples in its malicious history. If a sample is found to be within a certain distance (`ball_thresh`) of a previously seen malicious sample, it is reclassified as malicious, under the assumption that it might be an adversarial evasion attempt.

    An attacker can exploit this stateful behavior to increase the false positive rate of the defender. By submitting a series of diverse, genuinely malicious samples, the attacker can populate the history buffer (`self.malicious_queries`) with a broad range of malware feature vectors.  Because the history eviction policy is random (`self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))`), and does not prioritize recency or relevance, the history can become filled with a diverse set of malicious sample features.

    Subsequently, when a legitimate benign sample is submitted for analysis, it may, by chance, be found to be within the `ball_thresh` distance of one of the diverse malicious samples stored in the history. This can occur even if the benign sample is not an adversarial example and would otherwise be correctly classified as benign by the base EMBER model. Consequently, the benign sample will be incorrectly flagged as malicious by the stateful nearest neighbor check, leading to a false positive.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker registers and obtains an `api_token` if required to interact with the service.
    2. The attacker prepares a set of diverse, genuinely malicious PE files. Diversity can be achieved by selecting malware from different families or with significant structural variations.
    3. The attacker submits each malicious PE file to the defender service using the API endpoint (e.g., `/`). This populates the `StatefulNNEmberModel`'s `malicious_queries` history with features extracted from these malicious samples.
    4. The attacker prepares a legitimate benign PE file that is reliably classified as benign by the base EMBER model when tested in isolation.
    5. The attacker submits this benign PE file to the defender service.
    6. The `StatefulNNEmberModel` will first classify it as benign based on the EMBER model.
    7. Then, the nearest neighbor check is performed against the populated `malicious_queries` history.
    8. If the benign sample's features are within the `ball_thresh` distance to any of the malicious samples in history, the benign sample will be incorrectly reclassified as malicious.

- Impact:
    Increased false positive rate. Legitimate benign files may be incorrectly classified as malicious. This reduces the accuracy and reliability of the malware detection system. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to disruption of legitimate user activities, unnecessary security alerts, and erosion of trust in the detection system.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `max_history` parameter in `StatefulNNEmberModel.__init__`: This parameter limits the maximum number of malicious queries stored in `self.malicious_queries`. By default, it is set to 10,000. This mitigation limits the size of the history buffer but does not prevent the buffer from being filled with diverse malicious samples that can cause false positives for benign files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Intelligent History Eviction Policy: Implement a more sophisticated history eviction policy instead of random eviction. Policies could prioritize:
        - Recency: Evict older entries to focus on more recent threats.
        - Relevance/Diversity: Evict samples that are very similar to others already in the history to maintain diversity and prevent over-representation of certain malware types.
        - Confidence Score: Store a confidence score with each malicious sample in history (e.g., EMBER score). Evict samples with lower confidence scores first.
    - Feature Selection for Nearest Neighbor:  Refine the feature set used for nearest neighbor comparison. Using only the most relevant features might reduce the chance of benign files being falsely matched to malicious history entries.
    - Dynamic `ball_thresh` Adjustment: Instead of a fixed `ball_thresh`, consider dynamically adjusting this threshold based on the density or diversity of the malicious history. A denser or more diverse history might warrant a smaller `ball_thresh` to reduce false positives.
    - Benign History/Whitelist: Maintain a separate history of benign samples or a whitelist of known benign files to prevent them from being falsely flagged, even if they are close to malicious samples in the feature space.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to submit samples to the defender service.
    - The `StatefulNNEmberModel` must be in use with its stateful nearest neighbor detection enabled and a non-empty history.
    - The attacker needs to submit a sufficient number of diverse malicious samples to populate the history buffer to a point where it increases the likelihood of false positives for benign samples.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict(bytez)` function:**
    ```python
    def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
        score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
        trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez)
        trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez)
        trimmed_features = self.features

        if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh:
            self.malicious_queries.append((trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE], score))
            while len(self.malicious_queries) > self.max_history:
                self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))

        elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0:
            t = AnnoyIndex(self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE, 'manhattan')
            for i, (m, _) in enumerate(self.malicious_queries):
                t.add_item(i, m)
            t.build(20)

            q = trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]
            nn_ix = t.get_nns_by_vector(q, 10)

            dists = [np.linalg.norm(self.malicious_queries[ix][0] - q, 1) for ix in nn_ix]
            min_dist = min(dists)

            if min_dist < self.ball_thresh:
                logging.info("Detected Adversarial Example!")
                score = 1
        result = int(score > self.thresh)
        logging.info(f'result: {result}')
        return result
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The code adds features of samples classified as malicious (by either the base or trimmed model) to `self.malicious_queries` without any diversity check or intelligent eviction policy. The eviction is simply random: `self.malicious_queries.pop(index=randint(0, len(self.malicious_queries)))`.
    - **Feature Vector:** The code uses `trimmed_features[:self.ADV_INDEX_SIZE]` which corresponds to the first 512 features (histogram and byteentropy).
    - **Nearest Neighbor Check:** For benign samples (initial score below threshold), it checks for nearest neighbors in `self.malicious_queries` using AnnoyIndex and Manhattan distance. If the minimum distance is less than `ball_thresh`, the sample is classified as malicious.

    **Visualization:**
    Imagine a 2D feature space for simplicity.
    - Initially, `malicious_queries` is empty.
    - Attacker submits diverse malicious samples (M1, M2, M3...). Their features (f(M1), f(M2), f(M3)...) are added to `malicious_queries`. These points are spread across the feature space.
    - Now, a benign sample (B) is submitted. Its feature f(B) might fall close to f(M1) in the feature space, even if B is genuinely benign and not intended to be similar to malware.
    - If the distance between f(B) and f(M1) is less than `ball_thresh`, B is incorrectly classified as malicious due to the stateful NN check.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the defender service as described in `defender/README.md`.
        - Identify a benign PE file (BenignSample.exe) that is consistently classified as benign by the base EMBER model of the deployed service. You can verify this by submitting it to the service and confirming the `result` is 0.
        - Prepare a set of at least 100 diverse malicious PE files (Malware1.exe, Malware2.exe, ..., Malware100.exe) from different malware families if possible.

    2. **Populate Malicious History:**
        - Use `curl` or a similar tool to submit each of the malicious files (Malware1.exe to Malware100.exe) to the defender service endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`) using `POST` requests with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. This step is to pollute the state of the `StatefulNNEmberModel`.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST --data-binary @Malware1.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        curl -X POST --data-binary @Malware2.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ...
        curl -X POST --data-binary @Malware100.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```

    3. **Test Benign Sample after History Pollution:**
        - Submit the benign file (BenignSample.exe) to the defender service endpoint.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST --data-binary @BenignSample.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
        - Examine the JSON response. If the `result` is `1`, it indicates a false positive, and the benign sample was incorrectly classified as malicious due to the stateful nearest neighbor check.

    4. **Control Test (Benign Sample without History Pollution):**
        - Restart the defender service to clear the `malicious_queries` history.
        - Submit the same benign file (BenignSample.exe) to the defender service endpoint again.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST --data-binary @BenignSample.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
        - Examine the JSON response. The `result` should ideally be `0`, confirming that the benign sample is correctly classified as benign when the history is not polluted. If the result is `0` in this step and `1` in step 3, the vulnerability is validated.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the stateful defender model to increase false positives for benign files by first submitting a set of diverse malicious samples.
