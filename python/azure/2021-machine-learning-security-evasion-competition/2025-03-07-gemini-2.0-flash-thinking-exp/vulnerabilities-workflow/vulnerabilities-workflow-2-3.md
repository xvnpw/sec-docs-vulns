### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Machine Learning Model Evasion through Adversarial Examples

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a Portable Executable (PE) file, starting from a malicious PE file.
    2. The attacker subtly modifies the crafted PE file. These modifications are designed to alter the features extracted by the ML model (EmberModel) in a way that reduces its maliciousness score.
    3. The attacker iteratively refines these modifications by submitting the PE file to the defender service and observing the prediction result.
    4. The attacker continues this process until the defender service classifies the modified PE file as benign (result: 0), successfully evading the malware detection.
    5. The crafted adversarial example retains its malicious functionality, allowing the attacker to bypass the intended security mechanism.

* Impact:
    - Successful evasion of the malware detection system.
    - Allows malicious PE files to be classified as benign, potentially leading to system compromise if such files were to be executed based on the defender's verdict.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Stateful Nearest Neighbor (NN) Detection (defender/models/ember_model.py):** The `StatefulNNEmberModel` attempts to detect adversarial examples by maintaining a history of malicious samples and checking for nearest neighbors in feature space. This is intended to catch samples that are subtly modified versions of known malware.
    - **Feature Engineering (ember library):** The Ember model uses a comprehensive set of features extracted from PE files, which are designed to be robust against simple evasion techniques.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Adversarial Training:** Retraining the ML model with adversarial examples to improve its robustness against evasion attacks. This would involve generating adversarial examples and including them in the training dataset.
    - **Ensemble of Models:** Using multiple diverse ML models to make predictions. Evasion of one model might not guarantee evasion of the entire ensemble.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While the challenge is focused on ML evasion, general input validation and sanitization could help in preventing unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities beyond ML evasion. However, for this specific challenge, the input is expected to be PE files.
    - **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection:** Implement more robust rate limiting on submission requests to slow down iterative evasion attempts. Anomaly detection on submission patterns could also help identify potential attackers.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to the defender service endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` as used in testing).
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft and modify PE files.
    - The attacker benefits from knowledge about the features used by the Ember model and the model's threshold, although black-box evasion is also possible through iterative queries.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`defender/defender/apps.py` - `post()` function:**
        ```python
        @app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
        def post():
            if request.headers['Content-Type'] != 'application/octet-stream':
                resp = jsonify({'error': 'expecting application/octet-stream'})
                resp.status_code = 400
                return resp

            bytez = request.data
            model = app.config['model']
            result = model.predict(bytez) # Model prediction based on input bytez
            if not isinstance(result, int) or result not in {0, 1}:
                resp = jsonify({'error': 'unexpected model result (not in [0,1])'})
                resp.status_code = 500
                return resp

            resp = jsonify({'result': result}) # Returns prediction result to the attacker
            resp.status_code = 200
            return resp
        ```
        - The `post()` function in `apps.py` is the entry point for submitting PE files for analysis.
        - It receives raw bytes (`bytez`) from the request body.
        - It calls the `predict()` method of the loaded ML model (`model.predict(bytez)`).
        - The function returns the model's prediction (`result`) as a JSON response `{'result': result}`.
        - This endpoint is vulnerable to adversarial examples because it directly feeds the input PE file bytes to the ML model without any input sanitization or checks specifically designed to prevent adversarial manipulation. The model itself is the primary defense, and its inherent limitations to adversarial attacks constitute the vulnerability.

    2. **`defender/defender/models/ember_model.py` - `EmberModel.predict()` and `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict()` functions:**
        - `EmberModel.predict()`:
            ```python
            def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
                score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
                return int(score > self.thresh)
            ```
            - This function calculates a prediction score using `predict_proba()` and classifies the sample as malicious if the score exceeds a fixed threshold (`self.thresh`).
        - `StatefulNNEmberModel.predict()`:
            ```python
            def predict(self, bytez: bytes) -> int:
                score = self.predict_proba(bytez)
                trimmed_bytez = self.trimmer.trim(bytez)
                trimmed_score = self.predict_proba(trimmed_bytez)
                trimmed_features = self.features

                if score > self.thresh or trimmed_score > self.thresh:
                    # Add to malicious history
                elif len(self.malicious_queries) > 0:
                    # Nearest neighbor check
                    if min_dist < self.ball_thresh:
                        score = 1 # Adversarial Example detected
                result = int(score > self.thresh)
                return result
            ```
            - The `StatefulNNEmberModel` enhances the base `EmberModel` by adding a stateful nearest neighbor check.
            - Even with the stateful defense, the core vulnerability remains the susceptibility of the underlying `EmberModel` to adversarial manipulations that can reduce the prediction score below the threshold or bypass the nearest neighbor check.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Set up the defender service locally using Docker as described in `defender/README.md`. Ensure it is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
    2. **Prepare a malicious PE file:** Obtain a known malicious PE file (e.g., from `MLSEC_2019_samples_and_variants.zip`). Let's call it `original_malware.exe`.
    3. **Initial Detection Test:** Submit `original_malware.exe` to the defender service using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @original_malware.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
        Verify that the response is `{"result": 1}`, indicating it is correctly classified as malicious.
    4. **Craft Adversarial Example:** Use an adversarial attack tool or manual techniques (like PE section manipulation, overlay appending, etc.) to subtly modify `original_malware.exe`. Create a modified file, `adversarial_malware.exe`.  For example, using a hex editor, slightly modify bytes in non-functional parts of the PE file, or append benign data to the overlay.
    5. **Evasion Test:** Submit `adversarial_malware.exe` to the defender service:
        ```bash
        curl -XPOST --data-binary @adversarial_malware.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
        ```
    6. **Verification:** Check the response. If the response is `{"result": 0}`, it means the adversarial example successfully evaded the ML model.
    7. **Functionality Test (Optional but Recommended):** Execute `adversarial_malware.exe` in a safe environment (like a Windows Sandbox without networking) to confirm that it retains its malicious functionality despite evading detection.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can potentially evade the ML-based malware detection by crafting adversarial examples, exploiting the inherent vulnerability of machine learning models to subtle input manipulations.
