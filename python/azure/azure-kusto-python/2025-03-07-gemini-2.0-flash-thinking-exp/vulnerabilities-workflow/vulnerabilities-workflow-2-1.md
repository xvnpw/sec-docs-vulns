- **Vulnerability Name:** Kusto Query Language (KQL) Injection

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker identifies an application built using the Azure Kusto Python SDK that constructs KQL queries dynamically based on user-provided input.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious KQL query fragment, designed to be injected into the application's query construction process. For example, a malicious fragment could be designed to bypass intended filters or access unauthorized data.
  3. The application, without proper sanitization or parameterization, concatenates the attacker's malicious input directly into a KQL query string.
  4. The application executes this dynamically constructed KQL query against the Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) cluster.
  5. Due to the lack of input validation, the malicious KQL query is executed by the Kusto cluster. This can lead to various security impacts, including unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the injected KQL code and the application's permissions.

- **Impact:**
  - **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive information they are not authorized to view.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Malicious queries can be crafted to modify or delete data within the Kusto cluster, potentially leading to data integrity issues and business disruption.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful KQL injection might be leveraged to gain elevated privileges or perform administrative actions within the Kusto environment.
  - **Information Disclosure:** Error messages or query results stemming from malicious queries could inadvertently leak sensitive information about the database schema or data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The provided `azure-kusto-python` SDK itself **does not implement any built-in mitigations** against KQL injection. The SDK's purpose is to provide tools for interacting with Kusto, and it relies on the developers using the SDK to implement secure coding practices.
  - There is **no evidence of implemented mitigations** within the provided PROJECT FILES against KQL injection. The responsibility for preventing this vulnerability rests entirely with the developers building applications using this SDK.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:** The most effective mitigation is to utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements. This approach separates the KQL code structure from user-supplied input, preventing the input from being interpreted as code. The SDK and Kusto service both support parameterized queries.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before incorporating it into KQL queries. This includes validating data types, formats, and ranges, as well as escaping or removing potentially malicious characters or KQL syntax.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege by granting the application's Kusto credentials only the necessary permissions required for its legitimate operations. This limits the potential impact of a successful KQL injection attack.
  - **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used to construct KQL queries. This helps identify and remediate potential injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly related to the backend KQL injection, for web applications using this SDK, implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could be chained with KQL injection in some scenarios.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The application must use the `azure-kusto-python` SDK to interact with an Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) cluster.
  - The application code dynamically constructs KQL queries by embedding user-controlled input into the query string.
  - No input validation, sanitization, or parameterized queries are implemented to protect against malicious KQL injection.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **Absence of Vulnerable Code in SDK:** After a thorough review of the provided PROJECT FILES, including the SDK source code (`azure-kusto-data` and `azure-kusto-ingest` packages) and sample applications (`quick_start/sample_app.py` and `azure-kusto-data/tests/sample.py`), **no instances of vulnerable code directly within the SDK itself were found that dynamically construct KQL queries from user input.**
  - **SDK as an Enabler of Vulnerability:** The `azure-kusto-python` SDK provides the necessary functionality to execute KQL queries. However, it does **not enforce or guide developers towards secure query construction practices**. The SDK's API allows for the execution of arbitrary KQL queries, making applications built with it potentially vulnerable if developers fail to implement proper input handling.
  - **Focus on Application-Level Security:** The risk of KQL injection is **introduced at the application level**, in the way developers utilize the SDK to build query logic. If applications concatenate user-provided input directly into KQL query strings without adequate security measures, they become susceptible to this vulnerability.
  - **No Code Examples of Parameterized Queries:** The PROJECT FILES, including samples, do not prominently feature or emphasize the use of parameterized queries as a security best practice. This lack of readily available examples might lead developers to adopt less secure query construction methods.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - **Target Application:** Assume a web application named "Data Explorer Web UI" is built using the `azure-kusto-python` SDK. This application allows users to filter data from a Kusto table named "SalesData" based on product names. The application constructs a KQL query dynamically using user input from a filter field.
  - **Attacker Scenario:** An external attacker aims to exploit potential KQL injection vulnerability in the "Data Explorer Web UI" to access sales data for a product they are not authorized to view, and to potentially exfiltrate all customer emails.
  - **Steps:**
    1. **Identify Input Field:** Access the "Data Explorer Web UI" and locate the product filter field. Observe that the application constructs KQL queries based on the input to this field.
    2. **Inject Malicious KQL Fragment (Data Exfiltration):** In the product filter field, enter the following malicious KQL injection payload:
       ```
       ' OR 1=1; Customers | take 10 --
       ```
       This payload is designed to:
       -  `' OR 1=1;`:  This part is intended to bypass the original filter condition, effectively making it always true.
       -  `Customers`: This part injects a new KQL statement to query a table named "Customers," assuming such a table exists and might contain sensitive data.
       -  `| take 10`: This limits the results from the "Customers" table to 10 rows to avoid overwhelming the application or security monitoring in initial attempts.
       -  `--`: This is a KQL comment, intended to comment out any remaining part of the original query that might follow the injected code.
    3. **Submit Malicious Input:** Submit the form or trigger the query execution in the "Data Explorer Web UI" with the crafted input.
    4. **Observe Application Response:** Analyze the application's response.
       - **Vulnerable Behavior:** If the application returns data from the "Customers" table (e.g., a list of customer IDs or names) in addition to or instead of the expected "SalesData" filtered results, this indicates a successful KQL injection.
       - **Further Exploit (Email Exfiltration):** If the initial injection is successful, refine the payload to exfiltrate sensitive information. For example, inject:
         ```
         ' OR 1=1; Customers | project Email | take 10 --
         ```
         If the application now returns a list of customer emails, this confirms the ability to extract specific sensitive data through KQL injection.
    5. **Examine Kusto Logs (Optional):** If access to Kusto query logs is available, examine the logs for the executed query. Confirm that the logs show the injected malicious KQL query being executed against the Kusto cluster.
  - **Expected Result:**
    - **Vulnerable Outcome:** The application executes the injected malicious KQL query. The response includes data from the "Customers" table, demonstrating unauthorized data access. Further refinement of the payload allows exfiltration of customer emails. Kusto logs confirm the execution of the injected query.
    - **Mitigated Outcome (Secure Application):** The application correctly handles the input. It either:
      - Sanitizes the input, preventing the injection. The application returns only the expected filtered "SalesData" results.
      - Parameterizes the query, ensuring the input is treated as data, not code. The application returns only the expected filtered "SalesData" results.
      - Rejects the input as invalid, displaying an error message and preventing query execution.
