- Vulnerability Name: Kusto Query Injection in `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` methods

- Description:
    1.  An attacker can inject malicious Kusto Query Language (KQL) code into queries executed by the `azure-kusto-data` SDK.
    2.  This is possible if user-provided data is directly embedded into the query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    3.  For example, if an application constructs a Kusto query by concatenating user input with a base query string and then executes it using `execute_query` or `execute_mgmt`, a malicious user can manipulate the query logic.
    4.  By crafting specific input, an attacker can bypass intended query filters, access sensitive data, or potentially modify data within the Kusto database, depending on the permissions of the identity used by the SDK.

- Impact:
    - High.
    - Unauthorized data access: Attackers can read data they are not supposed to access.
    - Data modification or deletion: In some scenarios, attackers might be able to modify or delete data, depending on the permissions associated with the connection.
    - Information Disclosure: Sensitive information can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    - Data Integrity Violation: Data can be tampered with, leading to a loss of trust in the data.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code provided. The code lacks explicit input sanitization or parameterized query mechanisms to prevent Kusto query injection.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Parameterized queries: Implement parameterized queries to separate user-provided data from the query structure. This is the most effective way to prevent query injection. The SDK should provide or encourage the use of parameterization features if Kusto supports them. If not, the SDK needs to implement robust input sanitization.
    - Input sanitization: If parameterized queries are not feasible, implement thorough input sanitization to escape or remove potentially malicious characters and KQL keywords from user-provided data before incorporating it into queries. However, sanitization is generally less robust than parameterization and harder to get right.
    - Documentation: Provide clear guidelines and best practices in the SDK documentation, warning users about the risks of constructing queries with unsanitized user input and recommending secure query construction methods.

- Preconditions:
    1.  An application using `azure-kusto-data` SDK constructs Kusto queries dynamically by incorporating user-provided input.
    2.  The application uses `execute_query` or `execute_mgmt` methods to execute these dynamically constructed queries.
    3.  User input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being included in the query string.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **File: /code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client.py**
    2.  Methods `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` in `KustoClient` class are responsible for executing queries.
    3.  `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` methods take a `query` string parameter, which is directly passed to the Kusto service.

    ```python
    # Snippet from /code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client.py

    class KustoClient(_KustoClientBase):
        ...
        @distributed_trace(name_of_span="KustoClient.query_cmd", kind=SpanKind.CLIENT)
        def execute_query(self, database: Optional[str], query: str, properties: Optional[ClientRequestProperties] = None) -> KustoResponseDataSet:
            ...
            request = ExecuteRequestParams._from_query(
                query, # <--- User-controlled query string passed directly
                database,
                properties,
                self._request_headers,
                self._query_default_timeout,
                self._mgmt_default_timeout,
                self._client_server_delta,
                self.client_details,
            )
            return self._execute(self._query_endpoint, request, properties)

        @distributed_trace(name_of_span="KustoClient.control_cmd", kind=SpanKind.CLIENT)
        def execute_mgmt(self, database: Optional[str], query: str, properties: Optional[ClientRequestProperties] = None) -> KustoResponseDataSet:
            ...
            request = ExecuteRequestParams._from_query(
                query, # <--- User-controlled query string passed directly
                database,
                properties,
                self._request_headers,
                self._mgmt_default_timeout,
                self._mgmt_default_timeout,
                self._client_server_delta,
                self.client_details,
            )
            return self._execute(self._mgmt_endpoint, request, properties)
        ...
    ```

    4.  **File: /code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client_base.py**
    5.  `ExecuteRequestParams._from_query` method constructs the JSON payload for the query request, directly embedding the `query` string.

    ```python
    # Snippet from /code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client_base.py
    class ExecuteRequestParams:
        ...
        @staticmethod
        def _from_query(
            query: str, # <--- User-controlled query string passed directly from execute_query/execute_mgmt
            database: str,
            properties: ClientRequestProperties,
            request_headers: Any,
            timeout: timedelta,
            mgmt_default_timeout: timedelta,
            client_server_delta: timedelta,
            client_details: ClientDetails,
        ):
            json_payload = {"db": database, "csl": query} # <--- User-controlled query string embedded in payload
            if properties:
                json_payload["properties"] = properties.to_json()

            client_request_id_prefix = "KPC.execute;"
            request_headers = request_headers.copy()
            request_headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json; charset=utf-8"

            return ExecuteRequestParams(
                None, json_payload, request_headers, client_request_id_prefix, properties, timeout, mgmt_default_timeout, client_server_delta, client_details
            )
        ...
    ```

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1.  Set up a test Kusto cluster and database accessible to an external attacker (or simulate this environment).
    2.  Create a Python application that uses `azure-kusto-data` SDK to query the Kusto cluster. The application should dynamically construct Kusto queries based on user input. For example, the application might take a table name and a filter value from user input and construct a query like: `f"SELECT * FROM {user_table} WHERE column1 = '{user_filter}'"`.
    3.  As an attacker, provide a malicious input for `user_filter` designed to inject KQL code. For example, input like `'value' OR 1==1 --` to bypass the intended filter.
    4.  Observe the query executed on the Kusto cluster (if logging is enabled) or analyze the results returned by the application to confirm the injection.
    5.  Example malicious input and expected query:
        -   User input for `user_table`: `MyTable`
        -   User input for `user_filter`: `'value' OR 1==1 --`
        -   Constructed query (vulnerable): `SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE column1 = ''value' OR 1==1 --'`
        -   This injected query would bypass the `WHERE column1 = 'value'` condition and return all rows from `MyTable` due to `OR 1==1` and comment out the rest of the query using `--`.
    6.  Step-by-step test:
        -   Step 1: Start the Python application.
        -   Step 2: Input a table name (e.g., `StormEvents`).
        -   Step 3: Input malicious filter value:  `' OR EventType != '' //`
        -   Step 4: Observe the results. If the application returns more data than expected (e.g., all rows instead of filtered rows), the vulnerability is confirmed.
        -   Step 5: Examine logs (if available) to see the exact query executed, verifying the injected malicious KQL code.
