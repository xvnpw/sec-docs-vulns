### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: KQL Injection
- Description:
    - An attacker can inject malicious KQL commands by providing crafted input to applications using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK.
    - This occurs because the SDK directly incorporates user-provided strings into Kusto queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An application using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK takes user input and uses it to construct a Kusto query. For example, an application might allow users to filter data based on a search term.
        2. An attacker provides a malicious input string designed to inject KQL commands. For instance, instead of a simple search term, the attacker might input: `';database MySecretDatabase; .show tables //`
        3. The application, without proper sanitization, incorporates this malicious string into a Kusto query.
        4. The SDK sends this crafted query to the Azure Kusto service.
        5. The Kusto service executes the injected commands, potentially leading to unauthorized actions like accessing sensitive databases (e.g., `MySecretDatabase` in the example) or retrieving schema information (`.show tables`).
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data in other databases within the Kusto cluster.
    - Information disclosure, such as listing table names or schema details of other databases.
    - Potential for further exploitation depending on the application's logic and the attacker's ability to chain injected commands.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no explicit mitigations in the provided code to prevent KQL injection. The SDK directly constructs and executes queries based on user-provided strings without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement parameterized queries: The SDK should provide a mechanism to construct queries using parameters, ensuring that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code. This would involve separating the query structure from the user-supplied data.
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize user inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful KQL syntax before incorporating them into queries. However, parameterized queries are a more robust and recommended approach.
- Preconditions:
    - An application must be using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK to construct Kusto queries based on user-provided input.
    - The application must not be implementing any input sanitization or using parameterized queries.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client.py`
    - Methods: `execute_query`, `execute_mgmt`
    - Vulnerable Code Snippet:
      ```python
      def execute_query(self, database: Optional[str], query: str, properties: Optional[ClientRequestProperties] = None) -> KustoResponseDataSet:
          # ...
          request = ExecuteRequestParams._from_query(
              query, # User-controlled 'query' is directly used here
              database,
              properties,
              self._request_headers,
              self._query_default_timeout,
              self._mgmt_default_timeout,
              self._client_server_delta,
              self.client_details,
          )
          return self._execute(self._query_endpoint, request, properties)
      ```
    - Visualization:
      ```
      [User Input] --> query: str --> ExecuteRequestParams._from_query --> HTTP Request (query embedded as string) --> Kusto Service (executes query as is)
      ```
    - Explanation:
        - The `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` methods in `client.py` take a `query` string as input, which can originate from user input in a real-world application.
        - This `query` string is directly passed to the `ExecuteRequestParams._from_query` method and subsequently embedded in the HTTP request sent to the Kusto service.
        - No sanitization or parameterization is performed on the `query` string before execution.
        - An attacker can manipulate the `query` string to inject malicious KQL commands.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup a test environment with an Azure Kusto cluster and an application using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK to execute queries based on user input. For simplicity, this can be a basic Python script that takes a query from user input and executes it against a sample database.
    - Step 2: As an attacker, craft a malicious KQL query string designed to list databases. Example malicious input: `";database master; .show databases //"`
    - Step 3: Input this malicious string into the application's user input field (e.g., a search box or query input).
    - Step 4: Observe the application's behavior. If vulnerable to KQL injection, the application will execute the injected command `".show databases"` on the `master` database (or potentially the default database if the database context is not switched in the injected command).
    - Step 5: Verify the vulnerability by checking if the application output or logs reveal a list of databases from the Kusto cluster, which is information that should not be accessible through normal application usage.
