### Vulnerability: Kusto Query Language (KQL) Injection

- **Description:**
  - An attacker can inject malicious Kusto Query Language (KQL) code into queries executed by applications using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK. This vulnerability arises when user-provided data is directly embedded into Kusto query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization. Consequently, an attacker can manipulate the intended query logic by crafting malicious input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or information disclosure.
  - **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An application using the `azure-kusto-data` SDK dynamically constructs KQL queries by incorporating user-controlled input into the query string. For example, the application might construct a KQL query to filter data based on user-provided search terms or table names.
    2. An attacker crafts a malicious KQL query fragment, designed to be injected into the application's query construction process. This malicious fragment can be designed to bypass intended filters, access unauthorized data, or execute administrative commands. Examples of malicious fragments include SQL injection-style syntax like `' OR 1=1;` or commands to access different databases like `';database MySecretDatabase; .show tables //`.
    3. The application, without proper sanitization or parameterization of user input, directly concatenates the attacker's malicious input into the KQL query string.
    4. The application executes this dynamically constructed KQL query against the Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) cluster using methods like `execute_query` or `execute_mgmt` from the `azure-kusto-data` SDK.
    5. Due to the lack of input validation and secure query construction practices, the malicious KQL query is executed by the Kusto cluster. This can result in various security impacts, depending on the nature of the injected KQL code and the application's permissions.

- **Impact:**
  - **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive information they are not authorized to view, potentially from tables or databases beyond the application's intended scope.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Malicious queries can be crafted to modify or delete data within the Kusto cluster, leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, or even data loss.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful KQL injection might be leveraged to gain elevated privileges or perform administrative actions within the Kusto environment, especially if the application's Kusto credentials have excessive permissions.
  - **Information Disclosure:** Error messages or query results stemming from malicious queries could inadvertently leak sensitive information about the database schema, data, or even the existence of other databases within the Kusto cluster. For example, attackers could list database names or table schemas.
  - **Data Integrity Violation:** Data can be tampered with, leading to a loss of trust in the data and potentially impacting business decisions based on compromised information.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The `azure-kusto-python` SDK itself **does not implement any built-in mitigations** against KQL injection. The SDK's design focuses on providing functionality to interact with Kusto and relies on developers to adopt secure coding practices.
  - There are **no explicit mitigations** observed within the provided PROJECT FILES or SDK code against KQL injection. The responsibility for preventing this vulnerability entirely rests with the developers building applications using this SDK. The code directly passes user-provided strings into query execution methods without sanitization or parameterization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:** The most effective mitigation is to utilize parameterized queries. This approach separates the KQL code structure from user-supplied input, ensuring that user input is treated as data and not executable code. The SDK and Kusto service both support parameterized queries, and their use should be enforced or strongly encouraged.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before incorporating it into KQL queries. This includes validating data types, formats, and ranges, as well as escaping or removing potentially malicious characters or KQL syntax. However, sanitization is generally less robust and harder to maintain than parameterized queries.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege by granting the application's Kusto credentials only the necessary permissions required for its legitimate operations. This limits the potential impact of a successful KQL injection attack by restricting what an attacker can do even if injection is successful.
  - **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used to construct KQL queries. Automated static analysis tools and manual code reviews can help identify and remediate potential injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Documentation and Developer Guidance:** The SDK documentation should prominently feature warnings about KQL injection risks and provide clear guidelines and best practices for secure query construction, emphasizing the use of parameterized queries and input validation. Sample code should demonstrate secure query practices.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The application must use the `azure-kusto-data` SDK (or a similar vulnerable SDK) to interact with an Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) cluster.
  - The application code dynamically constructs KQL queries by embedding user-controlled input directly into the query string.
  - No input validation, sanitization, or parameterized queries are implemented to protect against malicious KQL injection.
  - The application uses methods like `execute_query` or `execute_mgmt` from the SDK to execute the constructed queries.

  - **File:** `/code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client.py` and `/code/azure-kusto-data/azure/kusto/data/client_base.py`
  - **Vulnerable Methods:** `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` in `KustoClient` class (`client.py`). `ExecuteRequestParams._from_query` in `client_base.py`.

                      Potential Kusto Injection Point (Lack of Parameterization/Sanitization)
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
    - The `execute_query` and `execute_mgmt` methods in `client.py` are the primary interfaces for executing Kusto queries. They both accept a `query` parameter, which is a string representing the KQL query to be executed.
    - This `query` string is directly passed to the `ExecuteRequestParams._from_query` method in `client_base.py`.
    - The `_from_query` method constructs the JSON payload for the Kusto API request. Critically, it directly embeds the user-controlled `query` string into the `"csl"` (Client Side Language) field of the JSON payload without any sanitization or parameterization.
    - This JSON payload is then sent as part of an HTTP request to the Kusto service. The Kusto service executes the KQL query exactly as it is provided in the `"csl"` field.
    - Because the SDK does not perform any input validation or offer built-in mechanisms for parameterized queries in these core execution paths, applications that directly pass user input to these methods are vulnerable to KQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `query` string to inject malicious KQL commands that will be executed by the Kusto service with the permissions of the application's Kusto connection.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - **Target Application:** Assume a web application named "Data Explorer Web UI" is built using the `azure-kusto-python` SDK. This application allows users to filter data from a Kusto table named "SalesData" based on product names. The application constructs a KQL query dynamically using user input from a filter field.
  - **Attacker Scenario:** An external attacker aims to exploit potential KQL injection vulnerability in the "Data Explorer Web UI" to access sales data for a product they are not authorized to view, and to potentially list all databases in the Kusto cluster.
  - **Steps:**
    1. **Identify Input Field:** Access the "Data Explorer Web UI" and locate the product filter field. Observe that the application constructs KQL queries based on the input to this field.
    2. **Inject Malicious KQL Fragment (Data Exfiltration and Database Listing):** In the product filter field, enter the following malicious KQL injection payload:
       ```
       ' OR 1=1; database master; .show databases --
       ```
       This payload is designed to:
       -  `' OR 1=1;`:  This part is intended to bypass the original filter condition, effectively making it always true and potentially returning all "SalesData".
       -  `database master;`: This part injects a command to switch the Kusto query context to the `master` database.
       -  `.show databases`: This KQL command lists all databases in the Kusto cluster.
       -  `--`: This is a KQL comment, intended to comment out any remaining part of the original query that might follow the injected code, preventing syntax errors.
    3. **Submit Malicious Input:** Submit the form or trigger the query execution in the "Data Explorer Web UI" with the crafted input.
    4. **Observe Application Response:** Analyze the application's response.
       - **Vulnerable Behavior:** If the application returns a list of databases (or an error message revealing database names) in addition to or instead of the expected "SalesData" filtered results, this indicates a successful KQL injection. The presence of database names in the response confirms the execution of the injected `.show databases` command.
    5. **Examine Kusto Logs (Optional):** If access to Kusto query logs is available, examine the logs for the executed query. Confirm that the logs show the injected malicious KQL query, including `database master; .show databases`, being executed against the Kusto cluster.
  - **Expected Result:**
    - **Vulnerable Outcome:** The application executes the injected malicious KQL query. The response includes a list of databases from the Kusto cluster, demonstrating unauthorized information disclosure. The application might also return all "SalesData" due to the `OR 1=1` condition. Kusto logs confirm the execution of the injected query.
    - **Mitigated Outcome (Secure Application):** The application correctly handles the input. It either:
      - Sanitizes the input, preventing the injection. The application returns only the expected filtered "SalesData" results.
      - Parameterizes the query, ensuring the input is treated as data, not code. The application returns only the expected filtered "SalesData" results.
      - Rejects the input as invalid, displaying an error message and preventing query execution.
