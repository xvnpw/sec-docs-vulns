- Vulnerability Name: Weak Default Credentials for Azure SQL Database

- Description:
    - The Feast Azure Provider deployment utilizes an ARM template (`fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`) to provision infrastructure, including an Azure SQL Database instance that serves as the offline store for Feast.
    - During the deployment process, users are prompted to provide an "Admin Password" for the Dedicated SQL Pool.
    - If users choose a weak password or fail to change the default password (if any), the Azure SQL Database instance becomes vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential guessing.
    - An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Database instance by exploiting these weak credentials.
    - Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive feature data stored in the offline store.

- Impact:
    - **High**.
    - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Database can lead to the exposure of sensitive feature data, potentially containing personal or proprietary information.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete feature data, compromising the integrity of the feature store and potentially impacting downstream machine learning models and applications relying on Feast.
    - **Unauthorized Access:**  Compromised database credentials can grant attackers persistent access to the Azure SQL Database, allowing for ongoing malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Documentation:** The project documentation (README files in `/code`, `/code/provider`, and `/code/provider/tutorial`) mentions the "Admin Password" parameter and instructs users to set it during deployment. However, this is merely a documentation-level recommendation and not a technical enforcement of strong passwords.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Password Complexity Enforcement:** The ARM template should enforce password complexity requirements for the "Admin Password" parameter, such as minimum length, and a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols).
    - **Password Strength Validation:** Implement password strength validation during the ARM template deployment to provide real-time feedback to users and encourage them to choose strong passwords.
    - **Prevent Default Password:** Ensure that the ARM template does not set a default password or, if unavoidable, forces users to change it immediately upon deployment.
    - **Security Hardening Guide:** Provide a comprehensive security hardening guide for users, detailing best practices for securing the deployed Feast infrastructure, including password management, network security configurations, and access controls.

- Preconditions:
    - User initiates the deployment of Feast Azure Provider using the provided ARM template (`fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`).
    - User proceeds with the deployment without setting a strong, unique "Admin Password" for the Azure SQL Database.
    - The Azure SQL Database instance is accessible over the network (typically within an Azure Virtual Network, but potentially exposed depending on user configuration).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/README.md`, `/code/provider/README.md`, `/code/provider/tutorial/README.md`
    - **Step 1:** These README files guide users through the deployment process of Feast Azure Provider, highlighting the "Admin Password" parameter as a required input during the ARM template deployment.
    - **Step 2:** The documentation emphasizes the user's responsibility to provide a password but lacks any enforcement or validation mechanisms within the ARM template itself.
    - **Step 3:** Review of the provided files does not reveal any code or configuration within the Feast project that automatically generates strong passwords, enforces password complexity, or prevents the use of weak passwords for the Azure SQL Database.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User --> [ARM Template Deployment] --> Azure SQL Database (Admin Password Parameter)
                                                    |
                                                    V
        Weak Password Input? ---------------------> Vulnerable Azure SQL Database Instance
        ```
    - **Conclusion:** The vulnerability is not due to flaws in the Python code but arises from the lack of security measures within the ARM template and deployment instructions to ensure strong passwords for the deployed Azure SQL Database.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Step 1:** Initiate the deployment of Feast Azure Provider by clicking the "Deploy to Azure" button provided in the `README.md` or `provider/README.md` or `provider/tutorial/README.md` files.
    - **Step 2:** When prompted for the "Admin Password" during the ARM template deployment, intentionally enter a weak password, such as "Password123". Complete the rest of the deployment process with default settings.
    - **Step 3:** Once the deployment is successful, identify the deployed Azure SQL Database instance in the Azure portal. Obtain the server name for the deployed Azure SQL Database.
    - **Step 4:** Using a tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio from a machine that has network access to the deployed Azure SQL Database, attempt to connect to the database. Use "sqladmin" as the username and the weak password ("Password123") provided in Step 2.
    - **Step 5:** If the connection is successful, it confirms that the Azure SQL Database instance is accessible with the weak password, demonstrating the vulnerability.
