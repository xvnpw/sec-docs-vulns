- vulnerability name: Weak Default Admin Password for Azure SQL Pool in Feast Azure Provider Deployment

- description:
    - The Feast Azure Provider offers an ARM template (`fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`, referenced in READMEs) for easy infrastructure deployment on Azure.
    - During the deployment process via this ARM template, users are required to set an "Admin Password" for the Azure SQL Pool.
    - The provided documentation and template do not enforce strong password policies, allowing users to set weak or default passwords.
    - If a user sets a weak password (e.g., "Password123", "admin", or a common dictionary word), and the Azure SQL Pool is inadvertently exposed to the internet or accessible from a less trusted network, it becomes vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
    - Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Pool by guessing or brute-forcing this weak administrative password.

- impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the underlying Azure SQL Pool database.
    - Confidentiality breach: Sensitive feature data stored in the SQL database can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    - Data integrity compromise: Attackers can modify or delete feature data, potentially corrupting the feature store and affecting downstream applications relying on feature accuracy.
    - Availability disruption: Attackers could potentially disrupt the Feast service by locking or damaging the database.
    - Lateral movement: In a more complex scenario, attackers might use the compromised database server as a pivot point to access other resources within the Azure environment.

- vulnerability rank: High

- currently implemented mitigations:
    - No specific mitigations are implemented within the project to prevent weak passwords.
    - The documentation mentions "Admin Password" as a required parameter during setup, but it lacks security guidance on password strength.
    - The ARM template itself (not provided in PROJECT FILES for direct analysis, but inferred from documentation) likely does not enforce password complexity.

- missing mitigations:
    - **Password Complexity Enforcement**: Implement password complexity requirements in the ARM template for the "Admin Password" parameter. This could include minimum length, character set requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and preventing commonly used passwords.
    - **Security Best Practices Documentation**: Enhance the documentation (README files and tutorial) to include a strong warning against using weak passwords and emphasize the importance of strong, unique passwords for database administrators.
    - **Password Strength Meter**: Consider integrating a password strength meter into the deployment process (if feasible within the Azure deployment portal context for ARM templates) to provide users with real-time feedback on password strength.
    - **Azure Key Vault Integration**: Explore leveraging Azure Key Vault to manage and rotate the SQL Pool admin password. This would involve modifying the ARM template to store the password in Key Vault instead of directly in the SQL Pool configuration, enhancing security and enabling password rotation.

- preconditions:
    - User deploys the Feast Azure Provider infrastructure using the provided ARM template ( `fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`).
    - User sets a weak "Admin Password" for the Azure SQL Pool during the ARM template deployment.
    - The Azure SQL Pool instance is exposed to the internet or accessible from a network that is not fully trusted.

- source code analysis:
    - **/code/README.md**: This file, along with `/code/provider/README.md` and `/code/provider/tutorial/README.md`, highlights the "Admin Password" as a required parameter for deploying the Feast Azure Provider using the provided ARM template. The documentation prompts users to provide this password but does not include specific security warnings or password complexity guidelines.
    - **/code/provider/tutorial/README.md**:  Reinforces the "Admin Password" as a required parameter in the "Deploy Infrastructure" section, further emphasizing its presence in the setup process without addressing security concerns.
    - **provider/cloud/fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json**: (This file is not provided in PROJECT FILES, so analysis is based on documentation and common ARM template practices). It's inferred that the ARM template, while requiring the "Admin Password" parameter, likely lacks password complexity enforcement mechanisms.  ARM templates can define parameters but enforcing password complexity typically requires custom logic or relying on Azure policy configurations, which are not evident in the provided documentation.  The vulnerability arises from the project's ARM template not proactively mitigating weak password usage, relying solely on the user to choose a strong password without guidance or enforcement.

- security test case:
    - **Preconditions**:
        - Deploy Feast Azure Provider on Azure using the "Deploy to Azure" button and the linked ARM template.
        - During the deployment, set the "Admin Password" for the Azure SQL Pool to a weak password, for example, "Password123".
        - Ensure that the deployed Azure SQL Pool is accessible from your test environment (in a real-world scenario, this vulnerability is amplified if the SQL Pool is publicly accessible, but for testing, network access from your test machine is sufficient).

    - **Steps**:
        1. Identify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or public IP address of the deployed Azure SQL Pool. This information can be found in the Azure portal within the deployed resource group.
        2. Use a SQL client tool such as:
            - **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** (for Windows)
            - **Azure Data Studio** (cross-platform)
            - **sqlcmd** (command-line tool, cross-platform)
        3. Configure the SQL client to connect to the Azure SQL Pool using the following connection details:
            - **Server name**: The FQDN or public IP address of the Azure SQL Pool identified in step 1.
            - **Authentication**: SQL Server Authentication
            - **Login**: `sqladmin` (This is the default administrator username for Azure SQL Pools created via ARM templates in this project)
            - **Password**: `Password123` (or the weak password you set during deployment)
        4. Initiate the connection attempt.

    - **Expected Result**:
        - The SQL client successfully establishes a connection to the Azure SQL Pool.
        - You are able to browse the database objects and execute SQL queries, demonstrating unauthorized access to the SQL database using the weak "Admin Password". This confirms the vulnerability.
