## Combined Vulnerability List

### Weak Default Credentials for Azure SQL Database

- **Vulnerability Name:** Weak Default Credentials for Azure SQL Database

- **Description:**
    - The Feast Azure Provider deployment utilizes an ARM template (`fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`) to provision infrastructure, including an Azure SQL Database instance that serves as the offline store for Feast.
    - During the deployment process, users are prompted to provide an "Admin Password" for the Dedicated SQL Pool.
    - If users choose a weak password or fail to change the default password (if any), the Azure SQL Database instance becomes vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential guessing.
    - An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Database instance by exploiting these weak credentials.
    - Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive feature data stored in the offline store.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**.
    - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Database can lead to the exposure of sensitive feature data, potentially containing personal or proprietary information.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete feature data, compromising the integrity of the feature store and potentially impacting downstream machine learning models and applications relying on Feast.
    - **Unauthorized Access:**  Compromised database credentials can grant attackers persistent access to the Azure SQL Database, allowing for ongoing malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation:** The project documentation (README files in `/code`, `/code/provider`, and `/code/provider/tutorial`) mentions the "Admin Password" parameter and instructs users to set it during deployment. However, this is merely a documentation-level recommendation and not a technical enforcement of strong passwords.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Password Complexity Enforcement:** The ARM template should enforce password complexity requirements for the "Admin Password" parameter, such as minimum length, and a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols).
    - **Password Strength Validation:** Implement password strength validation during the ARM template deployment to provide real-time feedback to users and encourage them to choose strong passwords.
    - **Prevent Default Password:** Ensure that the ARM template does not set a default password or, if unavoidable, forces users to change it immediately upon deployment.
    - **Security Hardening Guide:** Provide a comprehensive security hardening guide for users, detailing best practices for securing the deployed Feast infrastructure, including password management, network security configurations, and access controls.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User initiates the deployment of Feast Azure Provider using the provided ARM template (`fs_synapse_azuredeploy.json`).
    - User proceeds with the deployment without setting a strong, unique "Admin Password" for the Azure SQL Database.
    - The Azure SQL Database instance is accessible over the network (typically within an Azure Virtual Network, but potentially exposed depending on user configuration).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/README.md`, `/code/provider/README.md`, `/code/provider/tutorial/README.md`
    - **Step 1:** These README files guide users through the deployment process of Feast Azure Provider, highlighting the "Admin Password" parameter as a required input during the ARM template deployment.
    - **Step 2:** The documentation emphasizes the user's responsibility to provide a password but lacks any enforcement or validation mechanisms within the ARM template itself.
    - **Step 3:** Review of the provided files does not reveal any code or configuration within the Feast project that automatically generates strong passwords, enforces password complexity, or prevents the use of weak passwords for the Azure SQL Database.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User --> [ARM Template Deployment] --> Azure SQL Database (Admin Password Parameter)
                                                    |
                                                    V
        Weak Password Input? ---------------------> Vulnerable Azure SQL Database Instance
        ```
    - **Conclusion:** The vulnerability is not due to flaws in the Python code but arises from the lack of security measures within the ARM template and deployment instructions to ensure strong passwords for the deployed Azure SQL Database.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Step 1:** Initiate the deployment of Feast Azure Provider by clicking the "Deploy to Azure" button provided in the `README.md` or `provider/README.md` or `provider/tutorial/README.md` files.
    - **Step 2:** When prompted for the "Admin Password" during the ARM template deployment, intentionally enter a weak password, such as "Password123". Complete the rest of the deployment process with default settings.
    - **Step 3:** Once the deployment is successful, identify the deployed Azure SQL Database instance in the Azure portal. Obtain the server name for the deployed Azure SQL Database.
    - **Step 4:** Using a tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio from a machine that has network access to the deployed Azure SQL Database, attempt to connect to the database. Use "sqladmin" as the username and the weak password ("Password123") provided in Step 2.
    - **Step 5:** If the connection is successful, it confirms that the Azure SQL Database instance is accessible with the weak password, demonstrating the vulnerability.

### Potential SQL Injection in Feast Azure Provider Plugin

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential SQL Injection in Feast Azure Provider Plugin

- **Description:**
    - An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by the Feast Azure Provider plugin when it interacts with Azure SQL DB or Synapse SQL as offline stores.
    - This vulnerability can be triggered when the plugin dynamically constructs SQL queries using user-provided inputs without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - Step by step trigger:
        1. An attacker identifies input vectors in the Feast Azure Provider plugin that are used to construct SQL queries. These could include feature names, entity keys, filter conditions, or other parameters used during feature retrieval or ingestion.
        2. The attacker crafts a malicious input string containing SQL injection payloads. For instance, if the vulnerability lies in feature name handling, the attacker might attempt to use a feature name like `"; DROP TABLE users; --`.
        3. The attacker sends a request to Feast Azure Provider plugin that includes this malicious input. For example, this could be a feature retrieval request through the Feast API, a feature definition with a malicious name, or any other relevant interaction point.
        4. The Feast Azure Provider plugin, if vulnerable, incorporates the malicious input directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.
        5. This malicious SQL query is then executed against the configured Azure SQL DB or Synapse SQL offline store.
        6. If the injection is successful, the attacker can potentially manipulate the database operations beyond the intended query.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**.
    - **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Azure SQL DB or Synapse SQL, potentially exposing user data, feature data, or other confidential information.
    - **Data Manipulation**: Ability to modify or delete data within the offline store, leading to data integrity issues and potential denial of service.
    - **Unauthorized Command Execution**: Execution of arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing attackers to gain administrative control over the database or perform other malicious actions.
    - **Lateral Movement**: In a compromised Azure environment, successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for broader attacks, potentially allowing lateral movement to other Azure services or resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No specific mitigations for SQL injection are explicitly mentioned in the provided project files.
    - The project description mentions "secure enterprise deployment on a customer provisioned AKS cluster in an Azure VNET", but this pertains to the Feast on AKS deployment option and not the Azure Provider plugin itself, which is the focus of this vulnerability.  This AKS deployment security also doesn't inherently prevent SQL injection within the plugin's code.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization**: The project lacks explicit input sanitization mechanisms for user-provided data that is incorporated into SQL queries. All user inputs used in query construction should be rigorously sanitized to remove or escape potentially harmful SQL characters and commands.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements**: The project should implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This is a critical mitigation technique that separates SQL code from user-supplied data, effectively preventing SQL injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: It's essential to ensure that the database user account used by the Feast Azure Provider plugin has only the minimum necessary permissions required for its operation. This limits the potential damage if SQL injection is exploited.
    - **Security Audits and Code Reviews**: Regular security audits and code reviews focusing on data access layers and SQL query construction are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Feast Azure Provider plugin is deployed and configured to use Azure SQL DB or Synapse SQL as the offline store.
    - The Feast Azure Provider plugin's codebase dynamically constructs SQL queries.
    - User-controlled inputs are directly used in constructing SQL queries without sufficient sanitization or parameterization.
    - An attacker must be able to influence input parameters that are used in SQL query construction. This could be through various means, such as manipulating feature definitions, crafting malicious feature retrieval requests, or exploiting other input channels that reach the vulnerable query building logic.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Based on the provided files, direct source code analysis is not possible as only README files and configuration examples are given. Therefore, this analysis is based on hypothetical vulnerable code patterns within the Feast Azure Provider plugin.
    - Assume the plugin is written in Python and interacts with Azure SQL DB/Synapse SQL using a database connector library (e.g., SQLAlchemy, pyodbc).
    - Vulnerability can be triggered in code sections where SQL queries are constructed dynamically, potentially within functions handling:
        - Feature retrieval from the offline store based on user requests.
        - Data ingestion into the offline store from batch sources.
        - Feature registration or definition processes that might involve database interactions.
    - Hypothetical vulnerable code example (Python):
      ```python
      import pyodbc

      def retrieve_feature_data(feature_name, entity_value):
          conn = pyodbc.connect(connection_string) # connection_string would be from config
          cursor = conn.cursor()
          # Vulnerable query construction - direct string concatenation
          query = f"SELECT {feature_name} FROM feature_table WHERE entity_id = '{entity_value}'"
          cursor.execute(query)
          results = cursor.fetchall()
          return results
      ```
      In this example, if `feature_name` or `entity_value` are derived from unsanitized user inputs, a SQL injection attack is possible. For instance, an attacker could set `feature_name` to `feature1; DROP TABLE feature_table; --` to inject a malicious command.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Test Setup**:
        1. Deploy Feast Azure Provider plugin in a test environment, configured to use a test Azure SQL DB or Synapse SQL instance as the offline store.
        2. Define a simple Feature Table using the Feast Azure Provider that utilizes the Azure SQL DB/Synapse SQL offline store. Register this Feature Table with Feast Core.
        3. Ensure the test environment is isolated from production systems to prevent accidental damage during testing.
    - **Test Steps**:
        1. Identify input parameters for feature retrieval requests. For example, assume the Feast SDK allows users to specify feature names and entity IDs when requesting online or offline features.
        2. Craft a malicious feature retrieval request using the Feast SDK (or directly interacting with the Feast Serving component if possible). Embed SQL injection payloads within the input parameters. A potential payload to test might be a feature name crafted as: `"vulnerable_feature; DROP TABLE users; --"`. Alternatively, try injecting through entity IDs or filter conditions if applicable.
        3. Send the crafted feature retrieval request to the Feast Azure Provider.
        4. Monitor database logs (Azure SQL DB/Synapse SQL audit logs, query logs) for the test database instance. Look for:
            - SQL syntax errors that might indicate the database detected injected SQL code but blocked execution.
            - Evidence of attempted or successful execution of injected SQL commands, such as `DROP TABLE`, `SELECT` statements retrieving data outside the intended scope, or other anomalous database activities.
        5. Analyze the response from the Feast Azure Provider. Check for any unexpected errors, data returned that should not be accessible, or signs of data corruption.
    - **Expected Result**:
        - **Vulnerable Case**: If the system is vulnerable, the database logs might show signs of attempted SQL injection. Depending on the payload and the database user's privileges, the test could result in:
            - SQL error messages in logs indicating injection attempt.
            - Retrieval of unauthorized data (if a `SELECT` injection is successful).
            - Potential database errors or unexpected behavior.
        - **Mitigated Case**: If mitigations are in place (parameterized queries, input sanitization), the test should not show signs of SQL injection. The database logs should only reflect normal queries, and the application should handle the potentially malicious input gracefully without executing injected SQL.
