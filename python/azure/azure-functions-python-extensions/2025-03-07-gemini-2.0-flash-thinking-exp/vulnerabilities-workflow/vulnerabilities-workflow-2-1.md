### Vulnerability 1: Potential Path Traversal in Azure Storage Blob Extension via Blob Name

* Description:
    1. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that, when used as a blob name in the Azure Function's blob binding, could lead to accessing blobs outside the intended container or directory.
    2. This vulnerability is possible if the application using the `azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-blob` library allows user-controlled input to influence the `path` parameter of the `@app.blob_trigger` or `@app.blob_input` decorators, or if the blob name is derived from user-controlled data processed within the Azure Function.
    3. Although the provided code does not directly demonstrate user input controlling the blob path, if a developer were to build an application that dynamically constructs the blob path based on user input without proper sanitization, a path traversal vulnerability could be introduced.
    4. For example, if the `path` in `@app.blob_trigger(path="user_provided_path")` is directly taken from an HTTP request parameter without validation, an attacker could inject path traversal characters like `../` to access or trigger functions based on blobs in different containers or locations within the storage account, assuming the function app's identity or connection string has sufficient permissions.

* Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure**: An attacker could potentially read blob content from unauthorized containers or directories within the Azure Storage account if the function app's identity or connection string has read permissions beyond the intended scope.
    - **Unauthorized Function Execution**: If the vulnerable function is a blob trigger, an attacker could trigger the function by manipulating blob events related to blobs outside the intended scope.
    - **Data Manipulation (depending on function logic)**: If the function logic involves writing or deleting blobs based on the potentially traversed path, an attacker might be able to manipulate data in unintended storage locations.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The provided code itself does not directly handle user inputs for blob paths. The examples use placeholders like "PATH/TO/BLOB" and "CONTAINER", suggesting that these are intended to be configuration settings, not directly user-controlled values.
    - The library relies on the Azure Storage SDK for blob operations. The Azure Storage SDK itself has mechanisms to prevent access outside of the storage account scope defined by the connection string or identity.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The library and the provided code samples lack explicit input validation or sanitization for the `path` parameter in `@app.blob_trigger` and `@app.blob_input` decorators if they are intended to be dynamically constructed based on user input.
    - **Path Traversal Prevention**: There are no specific checks within the library to prevent path traversal attempts in blob names or container names. The security relies on the application developer to ensure that blob paths are constructed securely and not directly from unsanitized user inputs.

* Preconditions:
    - The application built using `azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-blob` must dynamically construct the `path` parameter for blob bindings based on user-controlled input.
    - The application must not perform adequate validation and sanitization of user-provided input before using it to construct the blob path.
    - The Azure Function's identity or connection string must have sufficient permissions to access storage locations outside the intended scope for the path traversal to be exploitable.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-blob/azurefunctions/extensions/bindings/blob/blobClient.py, containerClient.py, storageStreamDownloader.py**
    - These files define classes `BlobClient`, `ContainerClient`, and `StorageStreamDownloader` that are used to interact with Azure Blob Storage.
    - In the `__init__` methods of these classes, the `_blobName` and `_containerName` attributes are extracted from the `data.content` which is a JSON string representing the binding configuration.
    - Example from `BlobClient.__init__`:
      ```python
      if self._data:
          content_json = json.loads(data.content)
          self._containerName = content_json.get("ContainerName")
          self._blobName = content_json.get("BlobName")
      ```
    - The `get_sdk_type()` methods in these classes use `_containerName` and `_blobName` to create Azure Storage SDK client objects. For example, in `BlobClient.get_sdk_type()`:
      ```python
      return blob_service_client.get_blob_client(
          container=self._containerName,
          blob=self._blobName,
      )
      ```
    - **Vulnerability Point**: If the `ContainerName` or `BlobName` values in `data.content` (which originates from the function binding configuration) are influenced by unsanitized user input at the application level, path traversal characters in these names could be passed to the `get_blob_client` or `get_container_client` methods of the Azure Storage SDK.
    - **Mitigation in Code**: The library itself does not perform any sanitization on `_containerName` or `_blobName`. It directly uses the values extracted from the binding configuration to interact with Azure Storage. The security relies on how the application using this library constructs and provides the `path` configuration for the blob bindings.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Deploy an Azure Function App using the `azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-blob` library with a Blob Trigger function.
    2. **Vulnerable Code (Example - Application Level - Not in Extension Library Directly)**: Assume the `path` for `@app.blob_trigger` is dynamically set based on a query parameter from an HTTP request in a hypothetical scenario (this is to demonstrate the vulnerability if a developer misuses the extension).
       ```python
       import azure.functions as func
       import azurefunctions.extensions.bindings.blob as blob
       import logging
       import os

       app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)

       @app.route(route="trigger")
       async def http_trigger_path_injection(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
           user_path = req.params.get('blobPath')
           if not user_path:
               return func.HttpResponse("Please provide blobPath parameter", status_code=400)

           @app.blob_trigger(arg_name="client", path=user_path, connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
           def injected_blob_trigger(client: blob.BlobClient):
               logging.info(f"Triggered by blob: {user_path}")
               return "Function executed" # Dummy return

           # To actually trigger the function, we need to simulate a blob event.
           # In a real scenario, uploading a blob to the path would trigger it.
           # For testing, we are just defining the function with the injected path.
           return func.HttpResponse("Blob trigger with dynamic path defined", status_code=200)
       ```
    3. **Attack**: Send an HTTP request to the function endpoint with a malicious `blobPath` parameter designed for path traversal. For example:
       `https://<function_app_url>/api/trigger?blobPath=container1/../container2/malicious_blob`
       Here, we are trying to make the function trigger on a blob named `malicious_blob` in `container2`, even if the intended container was `container1`.
    4. **Expected Outcome**: If the application is vulnerable, and if the function app's storage account connection has permissions to `container2`, the function might be triggered (or attempt to access) based on the traversed path. In a real exploit scenario, the attacker would observe if the function behaves unexpectedly, possibly indicating access to a different container. For a blob input scenario, the attacker would try to read content from an unexpected blob path.
    5. **Verification**: Examine the function logs to see if there are any attempts to access or trigger based on the manipulated `blobPath`. Monitor Azure Storage logs if available to see if unauthorized access attempts are made based on the injected path.
