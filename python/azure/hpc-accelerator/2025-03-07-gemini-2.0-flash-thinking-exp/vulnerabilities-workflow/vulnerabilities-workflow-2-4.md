- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Default Password in VM Setup Documentation
- Description: The documentation for "Zero to Batch" and "HPC Skilling Hands-On Lab NDv4" provides instructions that include setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) with a default password "Password1". If users follow these instructions without changing the password, the VM will be vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- Impact: High - Unauthorized access to the deployed VM. An attacker could gain complete control over the VM, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or using it as a stepping stone for further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the project itself. The documentation mentions best practices for securing Azure Batch in `/code/scenarios/batch/docs/Zero to Batch.md`, but these are general recommendations, not specific mitigations for this vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations: The documentation should explicitly warn against using default passwords and instruct users to set strong, unique passwords during VM deployment. The deployment scripts should ideally enforce password complexity or provide mechanisms to generate and securely manage passwords.
- Preconditions: User follows the documentation and deploys the VM without changing the default password.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/scenarios/batch/docs/Zero to Batch.md` and `/code/scenarios/deeplearning/docs/HPC Skilling Hands-On Lab NDv4.md`
    - Step-by-step:
        1.  The documentation guides users to deploy a VM using ARM templates.
        2.  Step 2c in "Zero to Batch.md" and similar steps in "HPC Skilling Hands-On Lab NDv4.md" instruct users to "change the password if you need", implying that a default password exists and is acceptable to use.
        3.  The provided images in the documentation (e.g., `media/image9.png`) show a default username and password field, suggesting a default password is set or expected.
        4.  The documentation examples use `Password1` as the password.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step-by-step:
        1.  Deploy the "Zero to Batch" or "HPC Skilling Hands-On Lab NDv4" lab environment following the documentation *exactly*, including using the default password "Password1" when prompted during VM deployment.
        2.  Once the VM is deployed, attempt to SSH into the VM using the username `deployeradmin` (from documentation) and the password `Password1`.
        3.  If the SSH login is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Hardcoded Credential in CycleCloud Scripts
- Description: Several scripts in `/code/scenarios/deeplearning/code/slurm-ndv4/install/` (e.g., `09_cyclecli_install.sh`, `08_cyclecli_install.sh`, `07_cc_install_managed_identity.sh`) contain what appears to be a hardcoded password: `+ODgyZjBiOWUwOWQ4`. While it's not immediately clear what this password is used for without further code analysis, hardcoding credentials in scripts is a security risk. If this credential is used for authentication or authorization, it could be exploited if the scripts are exposed or analyzed by attackers.
- Impact: Medium - Potential unauthorized access to CycleCloud or related services, depending on where this credential is used. The impact is medium because the exact usage and sensitivity of this credential are not immediately clear and require further investigation.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the project.
- Missing Mitigations: Avoid hardcoding credentials in scripts. Use secure methods for credential management, such as environment variables, configuration files with restricted access, or dedicated secret management services.
- Preconditions: An attacker gains access to the scripts (e.g., by cloning the repository or accessing a deployed instance where these scripts are present) and reverse-engineers or analyzes them to identify the hardcoded credential.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Files: `/code/scenarios/deeplearning/code/slurm-ndv4/install/09_cyclecli_install.sh`, `/code/scenarios/deeplearning/code/slurm-ndv4/install/08_cyclecli_install.sh`, `/code/scenarios/deeplearning/code/slurm-ndv4/install/07_cc_install_managed_identity.sh`
    - Step-by-step:
        1.  Examine the scripts.
        2.  In `09_cyclecli_install.sh` and `08_cyclecli_install.sh`, the script calls `scripts/cyclecli_install.sh` with arguments including `"10.21.1.5" "hpcadmin" "+ODgyZjBiOWUwOWQ4" "8"`.
        3.  In `07_cc_install_managed_identity.sh`, the script calls `scripts/cc_install_managed_identity.sh` with arguments including `'cycleserver' 'hpcadmin' '+ODgyZjBiOWUwOWQ4' 'jrs02' '8'`.
        4.  In `scripts/cyclecli_install.sh` and `scripts/cc_install_managed_identity.sh`, the third argument is used as a password for CycleCloud initialization.
        5.  The string `"+ODgyZjBiOWUwOWQ4"` appears to be a hardcoded password being passed to the CycleCloud CLI for initialization.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step-by-step:
        1.  Deploy the "HPC Skilling Hands-On Lab NDv4" lab environment.
        2.  Access the CycleCloud VM (e.g., via Bastion).
        3.  Locate and examine the script `/opt/cycle_server/install_scripts/install/09_cyclecli_install.sh` (or similar scripts where this password is used).
        4.  Attempt to use the hardcoded password `+ODgyZjBiOWUwOWQ4` with the username `hpcadmin` to log in to the CycleCloud UI (if accessible) or to authenticate against other CycleCloud services.
        5.  If successful, the vulnerability is confirmed. (Note: This test case might be limited by the network configuration and access to the CycleCloud UI in a deployed lab environment. The primary evidence is the presence of the hardcoded password in the scripts).
