### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Sensitive Information Logging in Output Logs

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker modifies one of the benchmarking scripts (e.g., `NVIDIA_runner.py` or `AMD_runner.py`) or a benchmark-specific script (e.g., `Benchmarks/NVIDIA/LLMBenchmark.py`).
    2.  The attacker injects code into the modified script to execute a command that outputs sensitive information to standard output or standard error. This could be done by adding commands like `print(os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'])` or similar commands that expose environment variables, API keys, or other secrets.
    3.  The attacker tricks a user into downloading and running this modified benchmarking script. This could be achieved through social engineering, by hosting the modified script on a look-alike repository, or by compromising the user's local environment.
    4.  When the user executes the modified script, the injected command is executed.
    5.  The standard output and standard error from the executed command, which now contains sensitive information, are captured by the runner script and passed to the `write_log` function in `Infra/tools.py`.
    6.  The `write_log` function appends this output, including the sensitive information, to the `Outputs/log.txt` file.
    7.  The sensitive information is now logged in plain text within the `Outputs/log.txt` file, which is stored in the project's output directory.
    8.  If the attacker gains access to the `Outputs/log.txt` file (e.g., if the user inadvertently shares the log file or if there are other vulnerabilities allowing file access), they can retrieve the logged sensitive information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** If Azure credentials, Hugging Face API keys, or other sensitive credentials are logged, an attacker who gains access to the `Outputs/log.txt` file can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the user's Azure environment, Hugging Face account, or other systems associated with the exposed credentials.
    *   **Data Breach:** Exposure of other types of sensitive information, depending on what is logged, could lead to a data breach with varying degrees of impact based on the nature of the exposed data.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The project currently lacks any specific mitigations to prevent sensitive information logging. The `write_log` function in `Infra/tools.py` directly logs any provided message to the log file without any sanitization or filtering. The runner scripts (`NVIDIA_runner.py`, `AMD_runner.py`) blindly log the standard output and standard error of executed commands.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Implement secure logging practices to prevent the logging of sensitive information. This includes:
        *   **Output Sanitization/Filtering:**  Modify the `write_log` function or the logging process in runner scripts to sanitize or filter command outputs before logging. Implement regular expression-based filtering or similar techniques to remove potentially sensitive patterns (e.g., API keys, secrets, credential strings).
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Outputs:** Review all executed commands and identify those that might output sensitive information.  For these commands, avoid logging their standard output and standard error altogether, or selectively log only non-sensitive parts.
        *   **Secure Credential Handling Documentation:** Enhance documentation to strongly advise users against storing or exposing sensitive credentials (like API keys, Azure service principal secrets) in environment variables or configuration files used during benchmarking. Recommend using secure credential management solutions if necessary and avoid echoing or printing credentials during setup or execution.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   **User Runs Modified Script:** The attacker must successfully trick the user into downloading and executing a modified version of one of the benchmarking scripts.
    *   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Sensitive information, such as Azure credentials or API keys, must be accessible or exposed in a way that the modified script can capture and log it. This could be through environment variables, configuration files, or other means accessible to the script's execution environment.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **`Infra/tools.py`:**
        ```python
        File: /code/Infra/tools.py
        Content:
        import os
        import datetime
        pwd = os.getcwd() + "/Outputs/log.txt"

        def write_log(message: str, filename: str = pwd):
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
            log_entry = f"[{timestamp}]\n {message}\n"

            with open(filename, "a") as file:
                file.write(log_entry)
        ```
        The `write_log` function takes a `message` string as input and writes it directly to the `Outputs/log.txt` file without any sanitization or checks.

    *   **`NVIDIA_runner.py` (and `AMD_runner.py`):**
        ```python
        File: /code/NVIDIA_runner.py
        Content:
        ...
        from Infra import tools
        ...
        def get_system_specs():
            file = open("Outputs/system_specs.txt", "w")
            ...
            results = subprocess.run(["nvidia-smi", "--query-gpu=gpu_name,vbios_version,driver_version,memory.total", "--format=csv"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
            output = results.stdout.decode('utf-8').split('\n')[1].split(",")
            ...
            results = subprocess.run("nvcc --version | grep release", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
            cuda_version = results.stdout.decode('utf-8').split(",")[1].strip().split(" ")[1]
            ...
            tools.write_log(tools.check_error(results)) # Logging command output
            ...

        def run_CublasLt():
            test = gemm.GEMMCublastLt("config.json",machine_name)
            test.build()
            test.run_model_sizes()
            ...

        def run_NCCLBandwidth():
            test = NCCL.NCCLBandwidth("config.json", machine_name)
            test.build()
            test.run()
            ...
        ...
        if ("gemm" in arguments):
            match = True
            run_CublasLt()
            os.chdir(current)
        ...
        ```
        The `NVIDIA_runner.py` (and similarly `AMD_runner.py`) script uses the `tools.check_error` function, which in turn calls `tools.write_log` to log the output (both stdout and stderr) of `subprocess.run` commands. This pattern is used throughout the runner scripts and benchmark scripts. If a malicious or compromised script executes a command that outputs sensitive information, it will be logged to `Outputs/log.txt`.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Modify `NVIDIA_runner.py`:**
        *   Open the `/code/NVIDIA_runner.py` file.
        *   Locate the `get_system_specs()` function.
        *   Add the following lines within the `get_system_specs()` function, just before the `return output[0].strip()` line:
            ```python
            import os
            sensitive_env_variable = "DUMMY_API_KEY_FOR_TEST" # Replace with an actual env variable name if needed for testing in your environment
            if sensitive_env_variable in os.environ:
                sensitive_info = os.environ[sensitive_env_variable]
                print(f"Intentional logging of sensitive information: {sensitive_info}") # This will be captured as stdout
            ```
        *   Save the modified `NVIDIA_runner.py` file.

    2.  **Set up an environment variable (optional, for more realistic test):**
        *   In your terminal, set a dummy environment variable that could represent sensitive information:
            ```bash
            export DUMMY_API_KEY_FOR_TEST="TEST_API_KEY_VALUE_12345"
            ```

    3.  **Run the modified script:**
        *   Execute the `NVIDIA_runner.py` script:
            ```bash
            python3 NVIDIA_runner.py hbm
            ```
            (You can run any benchmark, `hbm` is just an example).

    4.  **Examine the output log:**
        *   Open the `Outputs/log.txt` file located in the `/code/Outputs/` directory.
        *   Search for the line starting with `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` followed by ` Intentional logging of sensitive information:`.
        *   You should find the line `Intentional logging of sensitive information: TEST_API_KEY_VALUE_12345` (or the value of your environment variable) logged in the `Outputs/log.txt` file.

    5.  **Clean up (optional):**
        *   Remove the added lines from `NVIDIA_runner.py` to revert it to its original state.
        *   Unset the environment variable if you set it: `unset DUMMY_API_KEY_FOR_TEST`.

    **Expected Result:** The security test case demonstrates that any information printed to standard output by the benchmarking scripts, including intentionally logged sensitive information, is captured and written to the `Outputs/log.txt` file due to the current logging mechanism, confirming the vulnerability.
