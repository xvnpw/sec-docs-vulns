## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Local Secure Key Release (SKR) Tool in Production Environment
- Description:
    1. The project provides a `local-skr` tool for development purposes, as documented in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    2. This tool is explicitly marked as insecure and intended for development and testing in non-SEV-SNP environments.
    3. The `local-skr` tool uses an "allow all CCE policy" and a fixed private key, bypassing security measures of a production Secure Key Release (SKR) setup.
    4. If an attacker gains access to a development or testing environment where `local-skr` is running, or if this tool is mistakenly deployed or used in a production-like setting, they can bypass intended attestation and key release policies.
    5. An attacker can send a `key/release` POST request to the `local-skr` endpoint (http://localhost:port as described in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`).
    6. The `local-skr` tool will release the requested key without proper attestation, allowing unauthorized access to secrets.
- Impact:
    - Critical. Unauthorized access to secrets intended for Azure Clean Rooms. This could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized data processing, and compromise of the clean room environment's confidentiality and integrity.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Explicit documentation in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md` clearly stating that the tool is insecure and not for production use.
    - Warning messages in the code and documentation about the insecure nature of the tool.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - No technical controls to prevent the tool from being deployed or used in non-development environments.
- Preconditions:
    - An instance of the `local-skr` tool is running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess the endpoint of the `local-skr` service (default: http://localhost:port).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The source code for `local-skr` is not provided in the PROJECT FILES, but the documentation in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md` clearly outlines the insecure design and purpose of the tool.
    - The documentation explicitly mentions "This is an **insecure implementation** that is meant for development consumption only and **not for production environments**."
    - The setup section also highlights the "allow all CCE policy" which signifies the lack of proper security checks.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `local-skr` container as described in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    2. Obtain the endpoint of the `local-skr` service (e.g., http://localhost:8284).
    3. Craft a `key/release` POST request to the `local-skr` endpoint, providing necessary parameters like `maa_endpoint`, `akv_endpoint`, `kid`, and `access_token` as described in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    4. Send the request using `curl` or a similar tool from outside the clean room environment (e.g., attacker's machine).
    5. Observe that the `local-skr` service releases the key in the response, even without proper attestation and regardless of the environment from which the request originates.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Misconfiguration of Governance Samples Leading to Unauthorized Access
- Description:
    1. The project provides governance samples (e.g., in `/code/samples/governance/README.md`) to help users set up Azure Clean Rooms governance.
    2. These samples might contain default configurations that are not secure by default or lack sufficient hardening for production deployments.
    3. If users follow these samples without proper security review and customization, they may inadvertently deploy governance components with overly permissive access controls.
    4. Misconfigurations could involve relaxed network policies, weak authentication settings, or overly broad authorization rules within the governance service or related components.
    5. An attacker exploiting these misconfigurations could gain unauthorized access to governance functions, potentially manipulating contracts, policies, secrets, or audit logs within the Azure Clean Room environment.
    6. For example, a sample might deploy a governance client or service with default credentials or open ports that are accessible from outside the intended network boundary.
- Impact:
    - High. Unauthorized access to and potential manipulation of Azure Clean Rooms governance components. This can compromise the integrity of governance policies, data access controls, and audit trails, leading to unauthorized data sharing or processing within the clean room.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - README files for governance and samples (e.g., `/code/samples/governance/README.md`, `/code/src/governance/README.md`) provide documentation on setup and usage.
    - Security considerations might be implicitly addressed by the use of confidential computing and attestation in the overall architecture, although the samples themselves may not fully enforce these in local testing environments.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Security hardening guidelines specifically for sample deployments, highlighting potential misconfiguration risks.
    - Security checklists or best practices for users deploying governance samples to ensure secure configurations.
    - Automated security scans or configuration validation tools for governance sample deployments.
- Preconditions:
    - Governance samples are deployed in an environment accessible to the attacker.
    - The deployment is performed using default or insecure configurations provided in the samples.
    - The attacker identifies and exploits the misconfigured component (e.g., exposed governance client, insecure service endpoint).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The PROJECT FILES contain numerous `docker-compose.yml` files (e.g., `/code/src/governance/test/docker-compose.yml`, `/code/samples/governance/docker-compose.yml`) and scripts (e.g., `/code/test/deploy-cgs.ps1`, `/code/samples/governance/deploy-cgs.ps1`) for deploying governance components locally using Docker.
    - Reviewing these files, especially the environment variable configurations, port mappings, and network settings, is crucial.
    - For example, the docker-compose files may expose ports publicly (`ports: - "0:6300"`) or use insecure configurations for local testing that should not be replicated in production.
    - Scripts might automate deployments without prompting users to configure strong authentication or authorization.
    - Deeper analysis of the scripts and container configurations is needed to pinpoint specific misconfiguration vulnerabilities.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the governance sample using the provided `deploy-cgs.ps1` script in `/code/samples/governance/`.
    2. Identify the exposed endpoints of the deployed governance client (`cgs-client`) and UI (`cgs-ui`) using `docker ps` or `docker compose ps`.
    3. Attempt to access the CGS UI (e.g., http://localhost:6290 as per `/code/samples/governance/README.md#cgs-ui`).
    4. Try to interact with the CGS API via the CGS CLI scripts (e.g., `/code/samples/governance/scripts/cgs.psm1`) or directly via HTTP requests using `curl` or similar tools, without proper authentication or authorization credentials.
    5. Observe if unauthorized access is granted to governance functionalities like contract management, policy management, secret management, or event management, indicating a misconfiguration vulnerability.
