## Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerabilities were identified and combined from the provided lists. Each vulnerability is described in detail, including its potential impact, severity, existing mitigations, and steps to reproduce and test.

### Insecure Local Secure Key Release (SKR) Tool in Production Environment
- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Local Secure Key Release (SKR) Tool in Production Environment
- **Description:**
    1. The project includes a `local-skr` tool intended for development, as documented in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    2. This tool is explicitly marked as insecure and designed for non-production, non-SEV-SNP environments.
    3. `local-skr` utilizes an "allow all CCE policy" and a fixed private key, bypassing production Secure Key Release (SKR) security measures.
    4. If an attacker gains access to a development or testing environment running `local-skr`, or if it's mistakenly used in production, they can circumvent attestation and key release policies.
    5. An attacker can send a `key/release` POST request to the `local-skr` endpoint (http://localhost:port as described in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`).
    6. The tool will release the requested key without proper attestation, granting unauthorized access to secrets.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Unauthorized access to secrets intended for Azure Clean Rooms. This can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized data processing, and a compromise of the clean room environment's confidentiality and integrity.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Clear documentation in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md` explicitly states the tool is insecure and not for production use.
    - Warning messages are present in the code and documentation about the tool's insecure nature.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Lack of technical controls to prevent deployment or usage of the tool outside of development environments.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The `local-skr` tool is running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker knows or can guess the `local-skr` service endpoint (default: http://localhost:port).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - While the `local-skr` source code is not directly provided, documentation in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md` details the insecure design.
    - The documentation explicitly warns: "This is an **insecure implementation** that is meant for development consumption only and **not for production environments**."
    - The "allow all CCE policy" mentioned in setup indicates the absence of proper security checks.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the `local-skr` container as described in `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    2. Identify the `local-skr` service endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:8284).
    3. Construct a `key/release` POST request to the endpoint, including parameters like `maa_endpoint`, `akv_endpoint`, `kid`, and `access_token` as per `/code/src/tools/local-skr/README.md`.
    4. Send the request using `curl` or a similar tool from an external machine.
    5. Verify that the `local-skr` service releases the key in the response, even without proper attestation and regardless of the request origin.

### Potential Misconfiguration of Governance Samples Leading to Unauthorized Access
- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Misconfiguration of Governance Samples Leading to Unauthorized Access
- **Description:**
    1. The project offers governance samples (e.g., `/code/samples/governance/README.md`) to guide users in setting up Azure Clean Rooms governance.
    2. These samples may contain default configurations that are not secure out-of-the-box or lack sufficient hardening for production.
    3. Users following these samples without thorough security review and customization might inadvertently deploy governance components with overly permissive access controls.
    4. Misconfigurations could include relaxed network policies, weak authentication, or broad authorization rules within governance components.
    5. Attackers exploiting these misconfigurations could gain unauthorized access to governance functions, potentially manipulating contracts, policies, secrets, or audit logs in Azure Clean Rooms.
    6. For example, a sample might deploy a governance client or service with default credentials or open ports accessible from outside the intended network.
- **Impact:**
    - High. Unauthorized access and potential manipulation of Azure Clean Rooms governance components. This can compromise the integrity of governance policies, data access controls, and audit trails, leading to unauthorized data sharing or processing within the clean room.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - README files for governance and samples (e.g., `/code/samples/governance/README.md`, `/code/src/governance/README.md`) provide documentation on setup and usage.
    - Implicit security considerations through the use of confidential computing and attestation in the overall architecture, though samples may not fully enforce these in local testing.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Security hardening guidelines specifically for sample deployments, emphasizing potential misconfiguration risks.
    - Security checklists or best practices for users deploying governance samples to ensure secure configurations.
    - Automated security scans or configuration validation tools for governance sample deployments.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Governance samples are deployed in an environment accessible to the attacker.
    - Deployment uses default or insecure configurations from the samples.
    - The attacker identifies and exploits a misconfigured component (e.g., exposed governance client, insecure service endpoint).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - PROJECT FILES contain `docker-compose.yml` files (e.g., `/code/src/governance/test/docker-compose.yml`, `/code/samples/governance/docker-compose.yml`) and scripts (e.g., `/code/test/deploy-cgs.ps1`, `/code/samples/governance/deploy-cgs.ps1`) for local Docker deployments.
    - Reviewing these files, especially environment variables, port mappings, and network settings is critical.
    - `docker-compose` files might expose ports publicly (`ports: - "0:6300"`) or use insecure configurations for local testing unsuitable for production.
    - Deployment scripts might lack prompts for strong authentication or authorization configurations.
    - Deeper analysis of scripts and container configurations is needed to pinpoint specific misconfiguration vulnerabilities.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the governance sample using `deploy-cgs.ps1` in `/code/samples/governance/`.
    2. Identify exposed endpoints of `cgs-client` and `cgs-ui` using `docker ps` or `docker compose ps`.
    3. Attempt to access the CGS UI (e.g., http://localhost:6290 as per `/code/samples/governance/README.md#cgs-ui`).
    4. Interact with the CGS API via CGS CLI scripts (e.g., `/code/samples/governance/scripts/cgs.psm1`) or direct HTTP requests without proper authentication or authorization.
    5. Observe if unauthorized access is granted to governance functionalities like contract, policy, secret, or event management, indicating a misconfiguration.
