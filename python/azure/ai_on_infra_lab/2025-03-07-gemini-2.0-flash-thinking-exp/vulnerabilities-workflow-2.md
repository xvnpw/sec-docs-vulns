## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities, combining information from provided lists and removing duplicates, focusing on high and critical severity issues that are realistically exploitable and fully described.

### 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Display of User-Provided Movie Review

- **Description:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a movie review text.
    - A user submits this crafted movie review through a web form.
    - The web application backend receives the review text and processes it using sentiment analysis logic.
    - The web application then displays the *original movie review text* along with the sentiment analysis result on a web page.
    - If the web application fails to properly sanitize or HTML-encode the movie review text before displaying it, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the review will be executed in the user's browser when the page is loaded.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
        - Cookie theft: Stealing other sensitive cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
        - Defacement of the web page: Altering the content of the displayed page.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user: If the user is logged in, the attacker can perform actions as that user, such as making unauthorized purchases or accessing sensitive data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code files do not include any web application code or sanitization mechanisms. The Python script focuses solely on sentiment analysis and does not handle web display or user input sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Output encoding: The web application displaying the movie review text must implement proper output encoding, specifically HTML encoding, before rendering the user-provided movie review text in the HTML context. This will ensure that any HTML tags or JavaScript code within the review text are treated as plain text and not executed by the browser.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A web application must be implemented to take user input (movie reviews) and display the results of sentiment analysis.
    - This web application must display the *original user-provided movie review text* on a web page.
    - The web application must be vulnerable to displaying user input without proper HTML sanitization or encoding.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The Python script `distilbert-base-uncased.py` processes user-provided text via the `--sample_text` argument for sentiment analysis.
    - The script itself does not introduce the XSS vulnerability, as it only performs text processing and does not handle web display.
    - The vulnerability arises in the web application layer that uses the output of this script (or similar logic) and displays user-provided input without proper sanitization.
    - **Data Flow Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (malicious review text) --> Web Application (backend) --> distilbert-base-uncased.py (sentiment analysis) --> Web Application (frontend - vulnerable) --> User Browser (malicious script execution)
        ```
    - The web application's frontend, responsible for displaying the sentiment analysis results and user input, is the vulnerable component if it fails to sanitize or encode user-provided movie review text before rendering it in HTML.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a web application that uses the provided Python script (or similar) for sentiment analysis and displays user-provided movie reviews and sentiment results.
    2. Access the web application through a browser and locate the input field for movie reviews.
    3. Enter the following payload into the movie review input field: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>This is a test review.`
    4. Submit the review.
    5. Observe the web page displaying the sentiment analysis result and the submitted movie review.
    6. If a JavaScript alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears, the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    7. Inspect the HTML source code of the web page. Locate where the movie review is displayed. Verify that the injected `<script>` tag is present in the HTML source without being properly encoded (e.g., as `&lt;script&gt;`). If the `<script>` tag is directly embedded in the HTML, it confirms the lack of output encoding and the presence of the XSS vulnerability.

### 2. Insecure Distribution of Executable Scripts

- **Description:**
    - The project provides Python and Bash scripts for users to download and execute.
    - There is no mechanism to ensure the integrity and authenticity of these scripts during distribution.
    - If the distribution channel is compromised, or if an attacker gains access to modify the hosted files, they could replace the legitimate scripts with malicious ones.
    - Unsuspecting users who download and execute these modified scripts would then unknowingly run malicious code on their local machines or in their cloud environments.
    - This is especially critical as the scripts are designed to interact with cloud resources, potentially leading to wider access compromise.

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine or within their cloud environment.
    - This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including:
        - Data theft.
        - Credential compromise.
        - Unauthorized access to cloud resources.
        - Potential further propagation of malware within the user's systems or cloud infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided files and documentation do not include any measures to ensure secure distribution or script integrity.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Code signing: Digitally sign the scripts to guarantee their origin and integrity. This would allow users to verify that the scripts are indeed from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with.
    - Secure distribution channel (HTTPS): Ensure the scripts are hosted and distributed through a secure channel (HTTPS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during download.
    - Integrity checks (Checksums/Hashes): Provide checksums (like SHA256 hashes) of the script files. Users can then calculate the checksum of the downloaded files and compare them against the provided checksums to verify integrity.
    - Verification instructions: Include clear instructions for users on how to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded scripts before execution. This should include steps to check digital signatures or checksums.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Users must download and execute scripts provided by the project as part of the lab instructions.
    - The distribution channel for the scripts is either insecure (e.g., using plain HTTP) or vulnerable to compromise.
    - Users are not provided with any means or instructions to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded scripts.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The provided files include `submit_job.sh` (bash script) and `distilbert-base-uncased.py` (Python script).
    - `submit_job.sh` script downloads and executes `distilbert-base-uncased.py`.
    - `distilbert-base-uncased.py` performs sentiment analysis.
    - No inherent code vulnerabilities (like command injection) exist within these scripts based on the provided arguments.
    - The vulnerability is due to the insecure distribution of these executable scripts.
    - **Scenario Visualization:**
        ```
        Compromised Distribution Point (Attacker replaces scripts) --> User Downloads Scripts --> User Executes Scripts (Malicious Code Runs)
        ```
    - If an attacker gains control over the script distribution point (e.g., a web server), they can replace legitimate scripts with malicious ones. When users download and execute these scripts, they will unknowingly run the attacker's code.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a controlled testing environment that mimics a user's local machine.
    2. Establish a simulated compromised distribution point (e.g., a web server under your control).
    3. Prepare a malicious replacement script for `distilbert-base-uncased.py` that performs a verifiable malicious action (e.g., creating a file named "INFILTRATED.txt").
    4. Replace the legitimate `distilbert-base-uncased.py` on the simulated compromised distribution point with the malicious script.
    5. As a test user, follow the lab instructions to download `distilbert-base-uncased.py` from the simulated compromised distribution point.
    6. Execute the downloaded script as instructed.
    7. Check for the execution of the malicious action. For example, verify if the "INFILTRATED.txt" file exists in the user's home directory.
    8. If the malicious action is successful, it confirms the vulnerability: an attacker can compromise user systems by replacing lab scripts at the distribution point.
