- Vulnerability Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Display of User-Provided Movie Review
- Description:
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a movie review text.
    - A user submits this crafted movie review through a web form.
    - The web application backend receives the review text and processes it using the provided Python script (or similar sentiment analysis logic).
    - The web application then displays the *original movie review text* along with the sentiment analysis result on a web page.
    - If the web application fails to properly sanitize or HTML-encode the movie review text before displaying it, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the review will be executed in the user's browser when the page is loaded.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
        - Cookie theft: Stealing other sensitive cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
        - Defacement of the web page: Altering the content of the displayed page.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user: If the user is logged in, the attacker can perform actions as that user, such as making unauthorized purchases or accessing sensitive data.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code files do not include any web application code or sanitization mechanisms. The Python script focuses solely on sentiment analysis and does not handle web display or user input sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output encoding: The web application displaying the movie review text must implement proper output encoding, specifically HTML encoding, before rendering the user-provided movie review text in the HTML context. This will ensure that any HTML tags or JavaScript code within the review text are treated as plain text and not executed by the browser.
- Preconditions:
    - A web application must be implemented to take user input (movie reviews) and display the results of sentiment analysis performed by the provided Python script (or equivalent backend logic).
    - This web application must display the *original user-provided movie review text* on a web page.
    - The web application must be vulnerable to displaying user input without proper HTML sanitization or encoding.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided Python script `distilbert-base-uncased.py` processes user-provided text via the `--sample_text` argument for sentiment analysis.
    - The script itself does not introduce the XSS vulnerability, as it only performs text processing and does not handle web display.
    - The vulnerability would arise in the web application layer that uses the output of this script (or similar logic) and displays user-provided input without proper sanitization.
    - To visualize, consider the data flow: User Input (malicious review text) -> Web Application (backend) -> `distilbert-base-uncased.py` (sentiment analysis - no vulnerability here) -> Web Application (frontend - vulnerable if no sanitization) -> User Browser (malicious script execution).
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a web application that uses the provided Python script (or similar) for sentiment analysis and displays user-provided movie reviews and sentiment results.
    2. Access the web application through a browser and locate the input field for movie reviews.
    3. Enter the following payload into the movie review input field: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>This is a test review.`
    4. Submit the review.
    5. Observe the web page displaying the sentiment analysis result and the submitted movie review.
    6. If a JavaScript alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears, the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    7. To further confirm, inspect the HTML source code of the web page. Locate the section where the movie review is displayed. Verify that the injected `<script>` tag is present in the HTML source without being properly encoded (e.g., as `&lt;script&gt;`). If the `<script>` tag is directly embedded in the HTML, it confirms the lack of output encoding and the presence of the XSS vulnerability.
