- Vulnerability name: Insecure Distribution of Executable Scripts
- Description: The project provides Python and Bash scripts for users to download and execute as part of learning exercises. However, there is no mechanism to ensure the integrity and authenticity of these scripts during distribution. If the distribution channel is compromised, or if an attacker gains access to modify the hosted files, they could replace the legitimate scripts with malicious ones. Unsuspecting users who download and execute these modified scripts would then unknowingly run malicious code on their local machines or in their cloud environments. This is especially critical as the scripts are designed to interact with cloud resources, potentially leading to wider access compromise.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine or within their Azure environment. This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including data theft, credential compromise, unauthorized access to cloud resources, and potential further propagation of malware within the user's systems or cloud infrastructure.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The provided files and documentation do not include any measures to ensure secure distribution or script integrity.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Code signing: Digitally sign the scripts to guarantee their origin and integrity. This would allow users to verify that the scripts are indeed from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with.
    - Secure distribution channel (HTTPS): Ensure the scripts are hosted and distributed through a secure channel (HTTPS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during download.
    - Integrity checks (Checksums/Hashes): Provide checksums (like SHA256 hashes) of the script files. Users can then calculate the checksum of the downloaded files and compare them against the provided checksums to verify integrity.
    - Verification instructions: Include clear instructions for users on how to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded scripts before execution. This should include steps to check digital signatures or checksums.
- Preconditions:
    - Users must download and execute scripts provided by the project as part of the lab instructions.
    - The distribution channel for the scripts is either insecure (e.g., using plain HTTP) or vulnerable to compromise.
    - Users are not provided with any means or instructions to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded scripts.
- Source code analysis:
    - The provided files consist of a `submit_job.sh` script and a `distilbert-base-uncased.py` Python script.
    - `submit_job.sh` is a bash script that downloads and executes `distilbert-base-uncased.py`.
    - `distilbert-base-uncased.py` is a Python script that performs sentiment analysis.
    - There are no inherent vulnerabilities within the code of these scripts themselves in terms of command injection or similar issues based on the given arguments.
    - The vulnerability arises from the lack of secure distribution practices for these executable scripts. If an attacker can replace these scripts at the distribution point, users downloading and running them will execute the attacker's code.
    - Example scenario: An attacker compromises the web server hosting the script files. They replace `distilbert-base-uncased.py` with a malicious script that exfiltrates user credentials or installs malware. When a user follows the lab instructions to download and run `distilbert-base-uncased.py`, they unknowingly execute the malicious script.

- Security test case:
    1. Set up a controlled testing environment that mimics a user's local machine where they would perform the lab exercises.
    2. Establish a simulated compromised distribution point. This could be a simple web server under your control, mimicking the project's intended distribution method.
    3. Prepare a malicious replacement script for `distilbert-base-uncased.py`. This script should perform an easily verifiable malicious action, such as creating a file named "INFILTRATED.txt" in the user's home directory or exfiltrating simulated sensitive data to a controlled server.
    4. Replace the legitimate `distilbert-base-uncased.py` on the simulated compromised distribution point with the malicious script.
    5. As a test user, follow the lab instructions to download the `distilbert-base-uncased.py` script from the simulated compromised distribution point.
    6. Execute the downloaded script as instructed in the lab guide (e.g., by running `submit_job.sh` or directly executing the Python script).
    7. Check for the execution of the malicious action. For example, verify if the "INFILTRATED.txt" file exists in the user's home directory or check logs on the controlled server for exfiltrated data.
    8. If the malicious action is successfully executed, it confirms the vulnerability: an attacker can compromise user systems by replacing the lab scripts at the distribution point.
