### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in shim.sh
- Description:
    - The `shim.sh` script is the main entry point for the HPC Pack Linux NodeAgent extension.
    - It determines the Python interpreter to use and then executes `hpcnodemanager.py`.
    - Crucially, the script takes all arguments passed to it (`$@`) and directly forwards them to `hpcnodemanager.py` without any validation or sanitization.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload as command line arguments to the `shim.sh` script. For example, an attacker could try to inject OS commands using arguments like `--operation=enable --custom_arg="; touch /tmp/pwned ;"`.
        2. The `shim.sh` script receives these arguments and stores them in the `ARG` variable: `ARG="$@"`.
        3. The script then executes the Python script `hpcnodemanager.py` using the command: `${PYTHON} ${COMMAND} ${ARG}`.
        4. Due to the lack of input sanitization, the malicious payload within `ARG` is directly passed to `hpcnodemanager.py` and could be interpreted as shell commands if `hpcnodemanager.py` or its subprocesses improperly handle these arguments. In a more direct scenario, if `hpcnodemanager.py` uses `os.system` or similar functions to execute shell commands with these unsanitized arguments, command injection will occur. Even if `hpcnodemanager.py` itself is safe, other scripts called by `shim.sh` or `hpcnodemanager.py` might be vulnerable.
- Impact:
    - Remote code execution.
    - A successful command injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Linux agent machine with the privileges of the user running the `shim.sh` script (likely root or a high-privilege user).
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the Linux agent node, allowing the attacker to:
        - Steal sensitive data.
        - Install malware.
        - Pivot to other systems within the network.
        - Disrupt services.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `shim.sh` script directly passes arguments without any validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization within the `shim.sh` script before passing arguments to `hpcnodemanager.py`.
    - Ideally, arguments should be parsed and validated to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious commands.
    - Consider using a safer method to pass arguments to the Python script, such as using a configuration file or environment variables instead of command-line arguments, if feasible. If command-line arguments are necessary, ensure proper parsing and validation within `hpcnodemanager.py`.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to control or influence the command-line arguments passed to the `shim.sh` script.
    - In the context of a Windows HPC cluster, this could potentially be achieved if the Windows HPC system sends commands to the Linux agent via mechanisms that allow control over the arguments passed to the agent's scripts, or if there's a way to manipulate the extension's execution environment to inject malicious arguments.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/VMExtension/shim.sh`
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        # ... [other lines] ...
        ARG="$@"
        # ... [other lines] ...
        ${PYTHON} ${COMMAND} ${ARG}
        ```
        - The line `ARG="$@"` captures all command-line arguments provided to `shim.sh` and assigns them to the variable `ARG`.
        - The line `${PYTHON} ${COMMAND} ${ARG}` then executes the Python script `hpcnodemanager.py` (defined by `COMMAND`) and passes the contents of `ARG` as arguments to it.
        - There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the arguments before they are passed to the Python script. This means any malicious commands injected within the arguments will be directly processed by the Python script or any subprocesses it may invoke.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a test environment where you can execute `shim.sh` or simulate its execution environment as part of the HPC agent within a Windows HPC cluster setup.
    2. Construct a malicious payload as a command-line argument for `shim.sh`. For example: `--operation=dummy_operation --malicious_arg='$(touch /tmp/pwned)'`. This payload attempts to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory.
    3. Execute the `shim.sh` script with the crafted payload: `./shim.sh --operation=dummy_operation --malicious_arg='$(touch /tmp/pwned)'`.
    4. After execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection was successful, as the `touch /tmp/pwned` command, injected through the arguments, was executed by the system.
