- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Azure Storage Account Configuration
- Description:
    1. The project utilizes an Azure Storage Account to store exported Azure Cost Management data before it is ingested into Azure Data Explorer.
    2. The documentation guides users to create a storage account and configure Azure Data Factory (ADF) to access it using Managed Identity.
    3. However, the documentation does not sufficiently emphasize the critical importance of securing the storage account itself.
    4. If a user misconfigures the storage account, for example by:
        - Enabling "Public access level" to "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)" or "Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)".
        - Setting overly permissive access policies using Azure RBAC, granting broad read access to users, groups, or service principals beyond what is necessary.
    5. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized read access to the exported cost data CSV files stored in the storage account.
    6. The attacker can then download and analyze these files to access sensitive cost information.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive Azure cost management data.
    - Exposure of detailed information about Azure spending, resource utilization, reserved instances, and potentially negotiated pricing.
    - This information can be valuable for competitors to understand a company's Azure strategy and spending habits, or for malicious actors to use for further attacks or financial gain.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None explicitly implemented within the project to prevent storage account misconfiguration.
    - The project documentation guides users to grant "Storage Blob Data Reader" RBAC permission to the ADF System Assigned Identity, which is a step towards least privilege for ADF access, but does not address the broader storage account security posture.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Stronger emphasis in documentation:** The documentation needs to prominently highlight the security risks associated with misconfiguring the storage account. It should explicitly warn against enabling public access and advise on implementing least privilege access policies.
    - **Guidance on secure configuration:** Provide clear, step-by-step guidance within the documentation on how to securely configure the storage account, specifically focusing on:
        - Disabling public access entirely.
        - Recommending the use of Private Endpoints to restrict access to the storage account from only within the Azure Virtual Network.
        - If public access is absolutely necessary (which is generally discouraged), detailed instructions on how to configure and verify minimal necessary RBAC permissions, and continuously monitor access policies.
    - **Consider Azure Policy:** Explore the feasibility of including an optional Azure Policy within the deployment templates that enforces private access (or at least disallows public access) on the deployed storage account. This could be a configurable option for users who want a more secure default setup.
    - **Post-deployment security check script:** Consider developing a post-deployment validation script or instructions that users can run to check the storage account's access configuration and identify potential misconfigurations. This script could check for public access settings and overly permissive RBAC rules.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have deployed the project's infrastructure.
    - The user must have misconfigured the Azure Storage Account used for cost data export, making it publicly accessible or setting overly permissive access policies.
    - Azure Cost Management export must be configured to export data to the misconfigured storage account.
- Source code analysis:
    - The provided project code does not directly configure or enforce security settings on the Azure Storage Account.
    - The ARM template (`azuredeploy.json`) and manual deployment steps in documentation (`docs/manual_deployment.md`, `docs/step2-5.md`, `docs/template_deployment.md`) guide users through creating and configuring the storage account and related services.
    - However, none of the code or scripts explicitly prevent or warn against insecure storage account configurations like enabling public access.
    - The vulnerability arises from the lack of strong security guidance and enforcement regarding storage account access control within the project's documentation and deployment process, rather than a flaw in the code itself.
- Security test case:
    1. **Deploy the Project:** Follow the manual deployment guide (`docs/manual_deployment.md`) or template deployment guide (`docs/template_deployment.md`) to deploy the solution, including the Azure Storage Account.
    2. **Misconfigure Storage Account:** After deployment, navigate to the deployed Storage Account in the Azure portal.
        - Go to "Configuration" under "Settings".
        - Change "Public access level" to "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)".
        - Click "Save".
    3. **Configure Cost Export (if not already done):** If not already configured during deployment testing, set up an Azure Cost Management export to the misconfigured storage account, targeting the "usage-preliminary" container as described in `docs/template_deployment.md` or `docs/manual_deployment.md`.
    4. **Trigger Data Export:** Manually trigger the Cost Management export or wait for the scheduled export to run. This will populate the "usage-preliminary" container in the storage account with cost data CSV files.
    5. **Attempt Unauthorized Access (External Attacker):** As an external attacker (from outside the Azure subscription or without explicit authorized credentials):
        - Obtain the Storage Account URL (e.g., from project deployment outputs or by guessing the naming convention).
        - Use a tool like `curl`, `wget`, Azure Storage Explorer (without authentication), or a web browser to attempt to access the storage account and list blobs within the "usage-preliminary" container.
        - Example using `curl` (replace `<storage_account_name>` and `<container_name>`):
          ```bash
          curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>?restype=container&comp=list"
          ```
        - If public access is enabled, the command or tool should successfully list the blobs (CSV files) in the container without requiring any authentication.
    6. **Verify Data Access:** If blob listing is successful, attempt to download one of the CSV files containing cost data.
        - Example using `curl` (replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<container_name>` and `<blob_name>` with an actual blob name from the listing):
          ```bash
          curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>" -o cost_data.csv
          ```
        - Verify that the download is successful and that the `cost_data.csv` file contains sensitive Azure cost management data, confirming unauthorized access.
    7. **Remediation:** Reconfigure the Storage Account to disable public access and implement secure access policies (e.g., using Private Endpoints and/or carefully managed RBAC).

This test case demonstrates how a misconfigured Azure Storage Account can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive cost data, validating the vulnerability.
