### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Service Principal Credentials in ARM Template
* Description:
    1. The ARM template deployment process requires users to provide a Service Principal client ID and client secret as parameters (`kustoIngestClientId`, `kustoIngestClientSecret`) as described in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    2. These parameters are used to configure the Azure Data Factory linked service for connecting to Azure Data Explorer.
    3. The client secret for the Service Principal is passed as a plain text parameter during the ARM template deployment, as seen in the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    4. If these ARM template parameters are not handled securely during deployment and afterwards, the Service Principal client secret could be exposed. For example, if the deployment commands are logged, stored in insecure parameter stores, or if the template parameters are kept in version control.
    5. An attacker who gains access to this client secret could use it to authenticate as the Service Principal.
    6. With valid Service Principal credentials, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster and the sensitive cost data stored within the `UsagePreliminary` and `Usage` tables.
* Impact:
    * Unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster.
    * Potential exposure of sensitive Azure cost management data, including detailed usage and billing information.
    * Data breach and compromise of confidential financial information.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The provided documentation in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` guides users to create and use a Service Principal with a secret but does not mention secure handling of these credentials.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Secure Credential Management Guidance:** The documentation should be updated to strongly recommend and guide users towards secure credential management practices for the Service Principal client secret. This should include:
        * **Discouraging hardcoding:** Explicitly warn against hardcoding the client secret directly in scripts or configuration files.
        * **Azure Key Vault:** Recommend using Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve the Service Principal client secret. Provide guidance on how to integrate Azure Key Vault with ARM template deployments and Azure Data Factory.
        * **Managed Identities (if feasible):** Re-evaluate if Managed Identities can be used for ADF to ADX connectivity in the future, as mentioned in `/code/docs/manual_deployment.md` considerations, to eliminate the need for Service Principal secrets altogether.
    * **ARM Template Parameter Security:** Improve the security considerations around ARM template parameters, emphasizing the need to handle sensitive parameters like `kustoIngestClientSecret` securely during deployment.
* Preconditions:
    * The project is deployed using the provided ARM template as described in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    * The user follows the documentation and provides a Service Principal client ID and secret as parameters during deployment.
    * The ARM template deployment parameters, specifically the `kustoIngestClientSecret`, are not handled securely, leading to potential exposure.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`: The "Parameter Reference" table and the "Azure CLI Tutorial" and "PowerShell Tutorial" sections clearly indicate that `kustoIngestClientId` and `kustoIngestClientSecret` are required parameters for the ARM template deployment. The tutorials show how to pass these parameters in plain text during deployment.
    * Snippets from "Azure CLI Tutorial" (`/code/docs/template_deployment.md`):
    ```bash
    read -d "\n" -r SP_AID SP_SECRET \
      <<<$(az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://azmetapipeline-test-sp" --skip-assignment --query "[appId,password]" -o tsv)

    # Deploy the template
    az deployment group create -g $RG_NAME \
      --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpbrown/azmeta-pipeline/master/azuredeploy.json" \
      --parameters \
      "deploymentIdentity=$MUID_RID" \
      "kustoIngestClientId=$SP_AID" \
      "kustoIngestClientSecret=@"<(echo $SP_SECRET)
    ```
    The `kustoIngestClientSecret` is directly passed as a parameter in the `az deployment group create` command, making it visible in command history and potentially logs.
    * While `azuredeploy.json` file is not provided, based on standard ARM template practices and documentation, it is highly likely that this template defines parameters for `kustoIngestClientId` and `kustoIngestClientSecret` and uses them to configure the Azure Data Factory Azure Data Explorer linked service.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Follow the instructions in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` to create a Service Principal and prepare for ARM template deployment using Azure CLI.
        * Modify the Azure CLI deployment script from `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` to intentionally log the `SP_SECRET` to a file or print it to the console. For example, add `echo "Service Principal Secret: $SP_SECRET" >> deployment_secrets.log` after the `read` command.
        * Execute the modified deployment script to deploy the ARM template, ensuring the Service Principal secret is logged.
    2. **Retrieve Secret:**
        * Access the log file `deployment_secrets.log` or command history and retrieve the plain text Service Principal secret.
    3. **Attempt Unauthorized Access:**
        * Use a machine outside the deployed Azure environment or a different user account to simulate an attacker.
        * Install the Azure Kusto Python SDK (or another Kusto client).
        * Using the retrieved Service Principal client ID (`SP_AID`) and client secret (`SP_SECRET`), construct a Kusto connection string to the deployed Azure Data Explorer cluster (you'll need the cluster URL, which can be obtained from the Azure portal after deployment).
        * Write a Python script (or use another Kusto client) to connect to the ADX cluster using the Service Principal credentials and execute a query against the `UsagePreliminary` table to retrieve cost data.
    4. **Verification:**
        * If the Kusto client successfully connects and retrieves data from the `UsagePreliminary` table using the retrieved Service Principal secret, it confirms that an attacker who obtains the secret can gain unauthorized access to sensitive cost data.
