- Vulnerability Name: Publicly Accessible Azure Blob Storage Container
- Description:
    1. The deployment process, as described in the documentation, creates an Azure Blob Storage account to store Azure Cost Management data exports.
    2. The documentation, specifically in `/code/docs/step2-5.md`, guides users to create a container named "usage-preliminary" but lacks explicit warnings or best practices regarding storage account and container access control.
    3. If a user misconfigures the storage account or container to be publicly accessible, by setting the public access level to "Blob" or "Container" for example, sensitive Azure cost data stored in the "usage-preliminary" blob container becomes accessible to unauthorized users on the internet.
    4. An attacker can discover the storage account name (which might be predictable or discoverable through misconfiguration) and then anonymously list blobs within the "usage-preliminary" container.
    5. The attacker can then download the CSV files containing detailed Azure cost data, potentially gaining access to sensitive financial information.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive Azure cost data, including detailed billing information, resource usage, and pricing.
    - Potential financial loss or competitive disadvantage due to the exposure of confidential cost data.
    - Reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The documentation in `/code/docs/step2-5.md` guides users to grant "Storage Blob Data Reader" permission to the Azure Data Factory (ADF) System Assigned Identity. This implements a form of access control for the intended data pipeline, but it does not prevent a user from additionally misconfiguring the storage account for public access.
    - The architecture implicitly suggests a secure setup within Azure, but it does not explicitly address or prevent public access misconfigurations of the storage account.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Explicit and prominent warnings in the documentation (`/code/docs/step2-5.md`, `/code/docs/manual_deployment.md`, `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`) about the critical security risks associated with making the Azure Blob Storage account or container publicly accessible.
    - Clear recommendations and step-by-step instructions in the documentation on how to properly secure the storage account and container, such as:
        - Emphasizing the importance of keeping the default storage account access level as private.
        - Recommending the use of private endpoints or firewall rules to restrict access to authorized Azure services and networks only.
        - Discouraging the use of storage account keys for access and promoting managed identities as the secure method for service-to-service authentication.
    - A security test case included in the testing documentation (`/code/docs/testing.md`) to specifically check and verify the storage account's public access configuration, highlighting the vulnerability if misconfigured.
- Preconditions:
    - The user deploying the solution must misconfigure the Azure Blob Storage account or the "usage-preliminary" container to allow public access. This could happen due to misunderstanding default settings or lack of security awareness.
- Source code analysis:
    - There is no specific source code within the provided files that directly introduces this vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from a potential misconfiguration during the deployment and setup process, exacerbated by the lack of explicit security guidance in the documentation. The provided scripts (`/code/db_init/__main__.py`, `/code/db_init/build_pyz.sh`) and Azure Data Factory pipeline configurations (`/code/docs/step6.md`) do not directly control the public access settings of the Azure Blob Storage account. The vulnerability is inherent in the deployment process and the provided documentation's lack of emphasis on storage account security best practices.
- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the Azure Cost Management to Kusto solution using the provided template or manual deployment steps.
    2. After successful deployment, navigate to the Azure portal and locate the deployed Azure Blob Storage account.
    3. Open the Storage account and go to the "Containers" section. Select the "usage-preliminary" container.
    4. Check the "Public access level" of the container. If it's set to "Blob" or "Container", proceed. If it's already set to "Private", manually change it to "Blob" or "Container" for testing purposes.
    5. Obtain the Storage Account name and the "usage-preliminary" container name.
    6. Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` from a network outside of the Azure environment where the solution is deployed (to simulate an external attacker).
    7. Construct a URL to list blobs in the container. For example, using Azure Storage REST API List Blobs operation, or simply trying to access a known blob name if you have one.
    8. Attempt to access the container anonymously without providing any authentication credentials.
    9. Verify if you are able to:
        - List the blobs within the "usage-preliminary" container. If you can get a list of blob names, it indicates unauthorized access.
        - Download any of the CSV files (blobs) within the container. If you can download the files, it confirms access to sensitive cost data.
    10. If steps 9 are successful, this confirms that the Azure Blob Storage container is publicly accessible and the vulnerability is present due to misconfiguration.
