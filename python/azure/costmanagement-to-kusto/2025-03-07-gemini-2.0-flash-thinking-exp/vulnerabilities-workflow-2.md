### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified high and critical vulnerabilities after reviewing provided lists, excluding duplicates and vulnerabilities that do not meet the specified criteria.

#### 1. Insecure Azure Storage Account Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. The project utilizes an Azure Storage Account to store exported Azure Cost Management data before it is ingested into Azure Data Explorer.
    2. The documentation guides users to create a storage account and configure Azure Data Factory (ADF) to access it using Managed Identity.
    3. However, the documentation does not sufficiently emphasize the critical importance of securing the storage account itself.
    4. If a user misconfigures the storage account, for example by:
        - Enabling "Public access level" to "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)" or "Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)".
        - Setting overly permissive access policies using Azure RBAC, granting broad read access to users, groups, or service principals beyond what is necessary.
    5. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized read access to the exported cost data CSV files stored in the storage account.
    6. The attacker can then download and analyze these files to access sensitive cost information.

- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive Azure cost management data.
    - Exposure of detailed information about Azure spending, resource utilization, reserved instances, and potentially negotiated pricing.
    - This information can be valuable for competitors to understand a company's Azure strategy and spending habits, or for malicious actors to use for further attacks or financial gain.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None explicitly implemented within the project to prevent storage account misconfiguration.
    - The project documentation guides users to grant "Storage Blob Data Reader" RBAC permission to the ADF System Assigned Identity, which is a step towards least privilege for ADF access, but does not address the broader storage account security posture.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Stronger emphasis in documentation:** The documentation needs to prominently highlight the security risks associated with misconfiguring the storage account. It should explicitly warn against enabling public access and advise on implementing least privilege access policies.
    - **Guidance on secure configuration:** Provide clear, step-by-step guidance within the documentation on how to securely configure the storage account, specifically focusing on:
        - Disabling public access entirely.
        - Recommending the use of Private Endpoints to restrict access to the storage account from only within the Azure Virtual Network.
        - If public access is absolutely necessary (which is generally discouraged), detailed instructions on how to configure and verify minimal necessary RBAC permissions, and continuously monitor access policies.
    - **Consider Azure Policy:** Explore the feasibility of including an optional Azure Policy within the deployment templates that enforces private access (or at least disallows public access) on the deployed storage account. This could be a configurable option for users who want a more secure default setup.
    - **Post-deployment security check script:** Consider developing a post-deployment validation script or instructions that users can run to check the storage account's access configuration and identify potential misconfigurations. This script could check for public access settings and overly permissive RBAC rules.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have deployed the project's infrastructure.
    - The user must have misconfigured the Azure Storage Account used for cost data export, making it publicly accessible or setting overly permissive access policies.
    - Azure Cost Management export must be configured to export data to the misconfigured storage account.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - The provided project code does not directly configure or enforce security settings on the Azure Storage Account.
    - The ARM template (`azuredeploy.json`) and manual deployment steps in documentation (`docs/manual_deployment.md`, `docs/step2-5.md`, `docs/template_deployment.md`) guide users through creating and configuring the storage account and related services.
    - However, none of the code or scripts explicitly prevent or warn against insecure storage account configurations like enabling public access.
    - The vulnerability arises from the lack of strong security guidance and enforcement regarding storage account access control within the project's documentation and deployment process, rather than a flaw in the code itself.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Deploy the Project:** Follow the manual deployment guide (`docs/manual_deployment.md`) or template deployment guide (`docs/template_deployment.md`) to deploy the solution, including the Azure Storage Account.
    2. **Misconfigure Storage Account:** After deployment, navigate to the deployed Storage Account in the Azure portal.
        - Go to "Configuration" under "Settings".
        - Change "Public access level" to "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)".
        - Click "Save".
    3. **Configure Cost Export (if not already done):** If not already configured during deployment testing, set up an Azure Cost Management export to the misconfigured storage account, targeting the "usage-preliminary" container as described in `docs/template_deployment.md` or `docs/manual_deployment.md`.
    4. **Trigger Data Export:** Manually trigger the Cost Management export or wait for the scheduled export to run. This will populate the "usage-preliminary" container in the storage account with cost data CSV files.
    5. **Attempt Unauthorized Access (External Attacker):** As an external attacker (from outside the Azure subscription or without explicit authorized credentials):
        - Obtain the Storage Account URL (e.g., from project deployment outputs or by guessing the naming convention).
        - Use a tool like `curl`, `wget`, Azure Storage Explorer (without authentication), or a web browser to attempt to access the storage account and list blobs within the "usage-preliminary" container.
        - Example using `curl` (replace `<storage_account_name>` and `<container_name>`):
          ```bash
          curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>?restype=container&comp=list"
          ```
        - If public access is enabled, the command or tool should successfully list the blobs (CSV files) in the container without requiring any authentication.
    6. **Verify Data Access:** If blob listing is successful, attempt to download one of the CSV files containing cost data.
        - Example using `curl` (replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<container_name>` and `<blob_name>` with an actual blob name from the listing):
          ```bash
          curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>" -o cost_data.csv
          ```
        - Verify that the download is successful and that the `cost_data.csv` file contains sensitive Azure cost management data, confirming unauthorized access.
    7. **Remediation:** Reconfigure the Storage Account to disable public access and implement secure access policies (e.g., using Private Endpoints and/or carefully managed RBAC).


#### 2. Hardcoded Service Principal Credentials in ARM Template

- **Description:**
    1. The ARM template deployment process requires users to provide a Service Principal client ID and client secret as parameters (`kustoIngestClientId`, `kustoIngestClientSecret`) as described in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    2. These parameters are used to configure the Azure Data Factory linked service for connecting to Azure Data Explorer.
    3. The client secret for the Service Principal is passed as a plain text parameter during the ARM template deployment, as seen in the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    4. If these ARM template parameters are not handled securely during deployment and afterwards, the Service Principal client secret could be exposed. For example, if the deployment commands are logged, stored in insecure parameter stores, or if the template parameters are kept in version control.
    5. An attacker who gains access to this client secret could use it to authenticate as the Service Principal.
    6. With valid Service Principal credentials, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster and the sensitive cost data stored within the `UsagePreliminary` and `Usage` tables.

- **Impact:**
    * Unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster.
    * Potential exposure of sensitive Azure cost management data, including detailed usage and billing information.
    * Data breach and compromise of confidential financial information.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The provided documentation in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` guides users to create and use a Service Principal with a secret but does not mention secure handling of these credentials.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Secure Credential Management Guidance:** The documentation should be updated to strongly recommend and guide users towards secure credential management practices for the Service Principal client secret. This should include:
        * **Discouraging hardcoding:** Explicitly warn against hardcoding the client secret directly in scripts or configuration files.
        * **Azure Key Vault:** Recommend using Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve the Service Principal client secret. Provide guidance on how to integrate Azure Key Vault with ARM template deployments and Azure Data Factory.
        * **Managed Identities (if feasible):** Re-evaluate if Managed Identities can be used for ADF to ADX connectivity in the future, as mentioned in `/code/docs/manual_deployment.md` considerations, to eliminate the need for Service Principal secrets altogether.
    - **ARM Template Parameter Security:** Improve the security considerations around ARM template parameters, emphasizing the need to handle sensitive parameters like `kustoIngestClientSecret` securely during deployment.

- **Preconditions:**
    * The project is deployed using the provided ARM template as described in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`.
    * The user follows the documentation and provides a Service Principal client ID and secret as parameters during deployment.
    * The ARM template deployment parameters, specifically the `kustoIngestClientSecret`, are not handled securely, leading to potential exposure.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - `/code/docs/template_deployment.md`: The "Parameter Reference" table and the "Azure CLI Tutorial" and "PowerShell Tutorial" sections clearly indicate that `kustoIngestClientId` and `kustoIngestClientSecret` are required parameters for the ARM template deployment. The tutorials show how to pass these parameters in plain text during deployment.
    - Snippets from "Azure CLI Tutorial" (`/code/docs/template_deployment.md`):
    ```bash
    read -d "\n" -r SP_AID SP_SECRET \
      <<<$(az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://azmetapipeline-test-sp" --skip-assignment --query "[appId,password]" -o tsv)

    # Deploy the template
    az deployment group create -g $RG_NAME \
      --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpbrown/azmeta-pipeline/master/azuredeploy.json" \
      --parameters \
      "deploymentIdentity=$MUID_RID" \
      "kustoIngestClientId=$SP_AID" \
      "kustoIngestClientSecret=@"<(echo $SP_SECRET)
    ```
    The `kustoIngestClientSecret` is directly passed as a parameter in the `az deployment group create` command, making it visible in command history and potentially logs.
    - While `azuredeploy.json` file is not provided, based on standard ARM template practices and documentation, it is highly likely that this template defines parameters for `kustoIngestClientId` and `kustoIngestClientSecret` and uses them to configure the Azure Data Factory Azure Data Explorer linked service.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        * Follow the instructions in `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` to create a Service Principal and prepare for ARM template deployment using Azure CLI.
        * Modify the Azure CLI deployment script from `/code/docs/template_deployment.md` to intentionally log the `SP_SECRET` to a file or print it to the console. For example, add `echo "Service Principal Secret: $SP_SECRET" >> deployment_secrets.log` after the `read` command.
        * Execute the modified deployment script to deploy the ARM template, ensuring the Service Principal secret is logged.
    2. **Retrieve Secret:**
        * Access the log file `deployment_secrets.log` or command history and retrieve the plain text Service Principal secret.
    3. **Attempt Unauthorized Access:**
        * Use a machine outside the deployed Azure environment or a different user account to simulate an attacker.
        * Install the Azure Kusto Python SDK (or another Kusto client).
        * Using the retrieved Service Principal client ID (`SP_AID`) and client secret (`SP_SECRET`), construct a Kusto connection string to the deployed Azure Data Explorer cluster (you'll need the cluster URL, which can be obtained from the Azure portal after deployment).
        * Write a Python script (or use another Kusto client) to connect to the ADX cluster using the Service Principal credentials and execute a query against the `UsagePreliminary` table to retrieve cost data.
    4. **Verification:**
        * If the Kusto client successfully connects and retrieves data from the `UsagePreliminary` table using the retrieved Service Principal secret, it confirms that an attacker who obtains the secret can gain unauthorized access to sensitive cost data.
