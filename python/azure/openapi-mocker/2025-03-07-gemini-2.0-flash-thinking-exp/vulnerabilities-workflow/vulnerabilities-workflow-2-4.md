* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in OpenAPI Specification File Loading
* Description:
    1. The `OpenApiMocker` library accepts an `api_path` argument, which specifies the location of the OpenAPI specification file. This path can be either a remote URL or a local file path.
    2. In the `ensure_api_is_stored_locally` function, the library checks if the provided `api_path` is a URL.
    3. If `api_path` is not identified as a URL, it is treated as a local file path and passed directly to the Connexion library to load the OpenAPI specification.
    4. The library does not perform any sanitization or validation on the local file path.
    5. An attacker can exploit this by providing a maliciously crafted `api_path` that includes path traversal characters such as `../` or `..\\`.
    6. When `connexion_app.add_api` uses this unsanitized path, it can navigate outside the intended directory and potentially access or include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
* Impact:
    - **File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious `api_path` pointing to files outside the expected directory. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or data.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of confidential information contained in the accessed files.
    - **Potential for further exploitation:** In more advanced scenarios, if the server misinterprets a file accessed via path traversal (e.g., a configuration file with executable code), it might lead to further vulnerabilities like remote code execution, although this is less direct in this specific context.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the provided `api_path` without any path traversal prevention mechanisms.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization:** Implement input validation and sanitization for the `api_path` to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    - **Path Normalization:** Normalize the path to resolve symbolic links and canonicalize it, ensuring it stays within the intended base directory.
    - **Allowed Path List/Directory:** Restrict the allowed paths for OpenAPI specification files to a predefined list or a specific directory, preventing access to arbitrary file system locations.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control the `api_path` parameter when instantiating the `OpenApiMocker` class. This typically means the application using this library must allow users to specify the OpenAPI specification file path, directly or indirectly.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/openapi_mocker.py` and `/code/src/openapi_mocker_alt1.py`
    - Function: `ensure_api_is_stored_locally(api_path)` (or `ensure_api_is_stored_locally(api_resource)` in `openapi_mocker_alt1.py`)

    ```python
    def ensure_api_is_stored_locally(api_path): # openapi_mocker.py
        """Download a remote API to a named temporary file."""
        if re.match("http(s)?://", api_path):
            tfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
            tfile.write(requests.get(api_path, timeout=5).content)
            tfile.flush()
            return tfile.name
        return api_path # Unsanitized path returned directly
    ```

    ```python
    def ensure_api_is_stored_locally(api_resource): # openapi_mocker_alt1.py
        """
        Download a remote API to a named temporary file.
        ...
        """
        if isinstance(api_resource, dict):
            return api_resource

        if re.match("http(s)?://", api_resource):
            tfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
            tfile.write(requests.get(api_resource, timeout=5).content)
            tfile.flush()
            return tfile.name
        return api_resource # Unsanitized path returned directly
    ```

    - **Explanation:** In both versions of the `ensure_api_is_stored_locally` function, if the provided `api_path` (or `api_resource`) does not match the URL pattern, it is directly returned without any validation. This unsanitized path is then used by the `connexion` library's `add_api` function to load the OpenAPI specification file. Connexion, in turn, uses standard file handling mechanisms that are susceptible to path traversal if the provided path contains malicious sequences.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a directory, e.g., `test_dir`.
        - Inside `test_dir`, create a valid OpenAPI specification file named `valid_spec.yaml` (content can be minimal valid OpenAPI spec like `SIMPLE_SWAGGER` from `openapi_mocker_test.py`).
        - Also inside `test_dir`, create a file named `sensitive_file.txt` with content "This is a sensitive test file.".
        - Navigate to the project's root directory (where `openapi_mocker.py` is located).
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the following Python code snippet:

        ```python
        from openapi_mocker import OpenApiMocker
        import requests

        malicious_path = "test_dir/../test_dir/sensitive_file.txt" # Path traversal to access sensitive_file.txt
        try:
            api_mock = OpenApiMocker(malicious_path)
            api_mock.start()
            response = requests.get(f"http://{api_mock.host}:{api_mock.port}/_openapi_mocker_/ping") # Send a request to trigger API loading
            api_mock.stop()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during server startup or request: {e}")
            if "could not read file" in str(e).lower() or "yaml" in str(e).lower() or "openapi" in str(e).lower():
                print("\n[VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED] Path traversal vulnerability likely exists.")
                print("The error message suggests the server attempted to load and parse 'sensitive_file.txt' as an OpenAPI spec, indicating path traversal.")
            else:
                print("\n[VULNERABILITY TEST INCONCLUSIVE] No clear indication of path traversal from error message.")

        ```
    3. **Expected Outcome:**
        - When running the test case, you should observe an error message during the startup of `OpenApiMocker` or when sending the ping request.
        - The error message should indicate that the server attempted to load and parse the content of `sensitive_file.txt` as an OpenAPI specification, but failed because it is not a valid OpenAPI/YAML file. This error confirms that the path traversal was successful and the server tried to access `sensitive_file.txt` based on the malicious path provided.
        - The presence of an error message related to "yaml", "openapi", or "could not read file" when providing the malicious path, in contrast to a successful startup with a valid `valid_spec.yaml` path, strongly suggests the path traversal vulnerability is exploitable.
