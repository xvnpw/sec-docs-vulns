### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: CSV Injection in Manifest Generation
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious CSV file. This file contains specially crafted strings in one or more columns.
    2. The attacker uses this malicious CSV file as input for the manifest generation process, either by running `src/generator.sh` or directly using `python -m loading_manifest.main_smds`.
    3. The `csv_to_json.py` script, which is part of the manifest generation process, reads the malicious CSV data.
    4. Due to the lack of input validation in `csv_to_json.py`, the script directly injects the unvalidated CSV data into the generated JSON manifests, replacing placeholders defined in the template JSON.
    5. The generated JSON manifests now contain the malicious payloads injected from the CSV file.
    6. When these compromised manifests are ingested into the OSDU platform, the malicious data is processed as part of the data loading process.
- Impact:
    - The injected malicious data within the manifests can be processed by the OSDU platform. The specific impact depends on how the OSDU platform handles and processes the injected data. Potential impacts include:
        - Data corruption within the OSDU instance, leading to inaccurate or unreliable data.
        - Exploitation of potential vulnerabilities within the OSDU platform's data processing pipelines if the injected data is crafted to trigger such vulnerabilities (e.g., if OSDU has vulnerabilities related to JSON parsing or data handling).
        - Unintended behavior or errors within the OSDU platform due to unexpected data structures or values.
    - The severity of the impact depends on the specific vulnerabilities within the OSDU platform and how it reacts to the injected malicious data.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any input validation or sanitization mechanisms to prevent CSV injection during manifest generation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization in `src/loading_manifest/csv_to_json.py` and `src/generator.sh`.
    - Validate CSV data against expected data types and formats before injecting it into JSON manifests.
    - Sanitize special characters or escape them appropriately when injecting CSV data into JSON structures to prevent control characters or structural elements from being interpreted as code or altering the intended JSON structure.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide a malicious CSV file to be processed by the manifest generation scripts.
        - For the "Developer Persona", this is directly achievable as the developer can directly run the scripts with a locally crafted malicious CSV file.
        - For the "Operations Persona", the attacker would need to manipulate the data within the Azure Storage Account file share before the data loading container instance executes. This could involve replacing legitimate CSV files with malicious ones in the storage account.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/loading_manifest/csv_to_json.py`
        - The `create_manifest_from_row` function is central to the manifest generation process. It takes a template and CSV row and populates the template with data from the CSV.
        - The function `replace_parameter_with_data` performs the parameter replacement.
        - In `replace_parameter_with_data`, the line `result = parent_object[key].replace(parameter, data)` directly substitutes the parameter placeholder with the `data` from the CSV file.
        - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
            ```python
            def replace_parameter_with_data(root_object, keys, parameter, data_row, col_index):
                # ...
                parent_object, key = get_deepest_key_object(root_object, keys)
                result = parent_object[key].replace(parameter, data) # No input validation on 'data'
                # ...
                parent_object[key] = result
            ```
        - There is no input validation or sanitization on the `data` variable which originates directly from the CSV file content. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the generated JSON by crafting malicious CSV data.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious CSV file named `malicious_field.csv` with the following content. This CSV is designed to inject a malicious key-value pair into the generated JSON.
        ```csv
        FieldName
        "}, "malicious_key": "malicious_value"
        ```
    2. Create a template JSON file named `template_field.json` that uses the `{{FieldName}}` parameter within a JSON object.
        ```json
        {
          "kind": "osdu:wks:Manifest:1.0.0",
          "MasterData": [
            {
              "kind": "osdu:wks:master-data--Field:1.0.0",
              "data": {
                "FieldName": "{{FieldName}}"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    3. Execute the manifest generation script using the malicious CSV and the template JSON. For example, using `main_smds.py` directly:
        ```bash
        python -m loading_manifest.main_smds --input_csv malicious_field.csv --template_json template_field.json --output_path output_manifests
        ```
    4. Inspect the generated JSON manifest file in the `output_manifests` directory. The filename will be similar to `malicious_field_1.json`.
    5. Verify that the generated JSON manifest contains the injected `malicious_key-value` pair within the `data` section. The `data` section should resemble the following, indicating successful injection:
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "FieldName": "}",
            "malicious_key": "malicious_value"
          },
          "kind": "osdu:wks:master-data--Field:1.0.0"
        }
        ```
        When this JSON is parsed, the `FieldName` will be truncated to `}`, and a new key `malicious_key` with the value `malicious_value` will be injected into the `data` object.
    6. (Optional, for deeper validation): Attempt to ingest this generated manifest into a test OSDU instance. Monitor the OSDU platform's behavior to assess how it processes the injected `malicious_key` and `malicious_value`. This step is crucial to determine the actual impact of the CSV injection vulnerability on the target OSDU system.

This test case confirms the CSV Injection vulnerability in the manifest generation process.
