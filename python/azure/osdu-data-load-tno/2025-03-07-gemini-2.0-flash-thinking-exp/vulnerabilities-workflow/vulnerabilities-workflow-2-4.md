### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Storage Account Access via ARM Template Misconfiguration
* Description:
    1. An attacker identifies an instance of `osdu-data-load-tno` deployed on Azure.
    2. The attacker examines the publicly available `azuredeploy.json` ARM template used by the project.
    3. The attacker analyzes the ARM template and finds that the deployed Azure Storage Account, intended for staging TNO data, is configured with overly permissive access policies. Specifically, the default configuration of the Storage Account allows for broad access, potentially through overly generous SAS tokens or improperly configured network rules.
    4. The attacker exploits this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access to the Storage Account.
    5. The attacker browses the Storage Account and accesses sensitive TNO open test data that is staged for loading into the OSDU instance.
* Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive TNO open test data staged in the Azure Storage Account.
    - Potential data breach if the TNO data contains confidential information or if the attacker can further exploit the access to the Storage Account.
    - Reputational damage for the project and the organization hosting the OSDU instance.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code and documentation do not include any specific mitigations for Storage Account access control misconfigurations.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Restrict Storage Account Network Access:** Implement network rules in the ARM template to limit access to the Storage Account only from authorized Azure services (e.g., the Container Instance running the data load script) and specific trusted networks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for SAS Tokens:** If SAS tokens are used, ensure they are generated with the principle of least privilege. Tokens should grant only the necessary permissions (e.g., write-only if only upload is needed) and for the shortest possible duration. The ARM template and scripts should be reviewed to ensure SAS token generation, if any, adheres to this principle.
    - **Azure Private Link:** Consider using Azure Private Link to access the Storage Account privately from within the Azure network, further reducing the attack surface from the public internet.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Implement regular security audits of the deployed Azure resources, including the Storage Account configurations, to identify and remediate any misconfigurations.
    - **Security Hardening Documentation:** Provide clear documentation and guidance to users on securely configuring the Azure Storage Account when deploying the ARM template, emphasizing the importance of restrictive access policies and network rules.
* Preconditions:
    - An instance of `osdu-data-load-tno` is deployed on Azure using the provided ARM template.
    - The Azure Storage Account deployed by the ARM template is misconfigured with overly permissive access policies, deviating from secure best practices.
    - The attacker has network access to the deployed Azure Storage Account (which might be the case if network rules are not properly configured).
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`File: /code/azuredeploy.json`**: This file is the ARM template responsible for deploying Azure resources, including the Storage Account.
    2. Analyze the `resources` section of the ARM template, specifically looking for the Storage Account resource definition (`type: 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts'`).
    3. Examine the `properties` of the Storage Account resource for configurations related to access control:
        - `networkAcls`: Check if `networkAcls` property is defined and how network rules are configured. If `bypass` is set to `None` or `AzureServices` only, and `defaultAction` is set to `Allow`, it might be overly permissive. If `ipRules` and `virtualNetworkRules` are not restrictively configured, it could also lead to excessive access.
        - `supportsHttpsTrafficOnly`: While enabling HTTPS is good practice, it doesn't control *who* can access the storage account.
        - `encryption`: Storage encryption at rest protects data if the disks are physically compromised, but it doesn't prevent unauthorized *access* via network.
        - **Absence of specific access restriction configurations:** If the ARM template primarily focuses on basic Storage Account deployment without explicitly defining restrictive `networkAcls`, it defaults to a less secure configuration, making it potentially vulnerable.
    4. **Scripts Analysis (`load.sh`, `src/data_load/load.py`):** Review these scripts to see if they interact with the Storage Account in a way that generates or uses SAS tokens. If SAS tokens are generated, analyze how they are created, what permissions they grant, and their expiry. If the scripts rely on Storage Account keys directly embedded or loosely managed, it would also be a vulnerability but less likely in template-driven deployments.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the `osdu-data-load-tno` project to Azure using the provided `azuredeploy.json` ARM template with default parameters.
        - Obtain the name of the deployed Storage Account (can be found in the Azure portal in the deployed resource group or from the deployment outputs).
    2. **Steps:**
        - **Attempt Public Access (if applicable):** Try to access the Storage Account directly from a public network without any specific authentication. This might be possible if the `azuredeploy.json` defaults to allowing public network access without restrictive network rules. Use Azure Storage Explorer or `az storage blob list` command with just the Storage Account name (and potentially default endpoints).
        - **Identify Potential SAS Tokens (if generated):** If the scripts generate SAS tokens, try to intercept or locate a SAS token (this might be more theoretical unless tokens are logged or exposed insecurely - examine script logs and outputs in the deployed Container Instance logs and Storage Account logs).
        - **Attempt Anonymous Blob Listing (if publicly accessible or with SAS token):** If you can access the Storage Account (even anonymously or with a SAS token), try to list the blobs in the container(s) used for staging data. For example, using `az storage blob list --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name output --output table --sas-token "<sas_token>"`. If publicly accessible, SAS token might not even be needed.
        - **Download Sample Data (if listing blobs is successful):** If you can list blobs, attempt to download a sample file from the Storage Account to confirm unauthorized data access. Use `az storage blob download --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name output --blob-name <blob_name> --file <local_file_name> --sas-token "<sas_token>"`. Again, SAS token might not be needed if publicly accessible.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - **Vulnerable:** If the Storage Account is misconfigured, the attacker should be able to list blobs and download data without proper authorization, proving the vulnerability.
        - **Not Vulnerable (Mitigated):** If network rules and access policies are correctly configured (which is not the case in the provided template by default), the attacker should be denied access, or require valid, restricted credentials that they should not possess, indicating the vulnerability is mitigated (or not present in the default deployment).
