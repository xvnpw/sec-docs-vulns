### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Input Sanitization Vulnerability leading to Potential Injection Attacks
* Description:
    * The Azure Functions Python worker processes external inputs, including HTTP requests and data from bindings.
    * If these inputs are not properly sanitized before being used within Azure Functions, they can become vectors for injection attacks.
    * Attackers can craft malicious inputs (e.g., through HTTP parameters) designed to inject code or commands into backend systems or the function's execution context.
    * This is particularly critical when functions construct queries to databases, interact with external APIs, or execute system commands based on unsanitized user-provided input.
    * Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to manipulate the intended logic of the function, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and data breaches.
    * The Azure Functions Python worker project, while providing the infrastructure, does not enforce or inherently include input sanitization mechanisms. The responsibility for secure input handling largely falls on the developers creating Azure Functions.
* Impact:
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by injecting malicious queries (e.g., SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection) to backend databases.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Malicious inputs could modify or delete critical data in connected systems.
    * **Code Execution:** In scenarios involving command injection or code injection, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Azure Function, potentially compromising the entire application, the underlying infrastructure, or other connected services.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The project includes a `SECURITY.md` file that directs users to report security vulnerabilities through MSRC, indicating a security-conscious approach.
    * The project utilizes `pip-audit` in CI pipelines to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, which is a general security best practice.
    * However, there are no specific input sanitization routines or libraries implemented within the Azure Functions Python worker itself to automatically handle and sanitize inputs.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input Sanitization Mechanisms:** The Azure Functions Python worker lacks built-in input sanitization or validation mechanisms for handling external inputs.
    * **Secure Coding Guidelines and Tools:** The project does not provide explicit secure coding guidelines or vulnerability scanning tools tailored to help developers prevent injection vulnerabilities in their Azure Functions.
    * **Security Test Cases:** Specific security test cases targeting input injection vulnerabilities are missing from the project's test suite.
    * **Documentation:** There is a lack of comprehensive documentation detailing best practices for input sanitization and secure development when using the Azure Functions Python worker.
* Preconditions:
    * Developers must use the Azure Functions Python worker to create and deploy Azure Functions.
    * These Azure Functions must be designed to process external inputs, such as HTTP requests, queue messages, or database events.
    * User-developed Azure Functions must utilize external input in a way that can lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., constructing database queries, system commands, or API calls).
    * Crucially, these user-developed Azure Functions must lack proper input sanitization and validation routines.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The Azure Functions Python worker project files primarily focus on the worker's infrastructure, build processes, and testing framework.
    * A direct source code analysis of these files will not reveal specific vulnerable code *within the worker itself* related to input sanitization, as the worker's design delegates input handling and sanitization to the function code developed by users.
    * The vulnerability arises from the architectural design where the worker provides the execution environment but does not enforce or provide default input sanitization.
    * The risk is therefore inherent in the *usage* of the worker by developers who might not be fully aware of or prioritize input sanitization in their function code.
* Security Test Case:
    * Vulnerability Test Name: Input Injection Vulnerability Test (HTTP Parameter Injection & SQL Injection Example)
    * Description: Test for input injection vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads designed to exploit potential weaknesses in input handling.
    * Steps:
        1. Deploy an Azure Function using the Python worker with an HTTP trigger. The function should process an HTTP request parameter and use it in a backend operation (e.g., a database query or system command). For example, a function that takes an `itemName` parameter and uses it in a SQL query.
        2. Craft a malicious HTTP GET request to the deployed function's endpoint.
            * **HTTP Parameter Injection Test:**  Inject code directly into an HTTP parameter. For example: `GET /api/HttpFunction?param='; import os; os.system('malicious_command') #'`.
            * **SQL Injection Test:** Craft a SQL injection payload within a parameter used in a database query. For example: `GET /api/HttpFunction?itemName='item' OR '1'='1'`.
        3. Send the crafted HTTP request to the Azure Function endpoint.
        4. Analyze the response from the Azure Function.
        5. Observe the logs and behavior of the Azure Function and any connected backend systems to determine if the malicious payload was executed or caused unintended effects, such as unauthorized data access or system command execution.
        6. Expected Result (Vulnerable Function): The injected payload is executed. For HTTP Parameter Injection, this might manifest as unexpected system behavior or errors. For SQL Injection, it might result in the function returning more data than intended or displaying database errors indicating successful injection.
        7. Expected Result (Mitigated Function): A secure function should sanitize the input parameter, preventing the execution of the injected payload. The response should be predictable and safe, and system logs should not show any signs of unintended activity. A secure implementation for SQL injection would use parameterized queries or ORM features to properly escape and handle user inputs.
