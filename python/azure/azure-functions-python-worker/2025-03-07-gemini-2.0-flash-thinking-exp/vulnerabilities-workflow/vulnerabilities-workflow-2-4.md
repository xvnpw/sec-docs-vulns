- Vulnerability Name: Potential Injection Vulnerabilities in User-Developed Azure Functions
- Description:
    - Step 1: A developer uses the Azure Functions Python worker to create an Azure Function.
    - Step 2: This Azure Function processes user-provided input, for example, through an HTTP trigger or a binding to a database.
    - Step 3: The function constructs queries or commands using this unsanitized user input to interact with backend systems (e.g., databases, external APIs, operating system commands).
    - Step 4: An attacker crafts a malicious input designed to inject code or commands into these queries or commands.
    - Step 5: The Azure Function, lacking input sanitization, executes the injected malicious payload.
- Impact:
    - Data Breach: Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by injecting SQL or NoSQL queries.
    - Data Manipulation: Malicious inputs could modify or delete data in backend systems.
    - Code Execution: In command injection scenarios, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Azure Function, potentially compromising the entire application or even the underlying infrastructure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files. The project provides the worker, but security is the responsibility of the function developer.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - No built-in input sanitization or validation mechanisms within the Python worker itself.
    - Lack of secure coding guidelines or vulnerability scanning tools in the project to assist developers in preventing injection vulnerabilities in their Azure Functions.
- Preconditions:
    - Developers must use the Azure Functions Python worker to create and deploy Azure Functions.
    - These Azure Functions must process external inputs and use those inputs to construct commands or queries for backend systems.
    - User-developed Azure Functions must lack proper input sanitization and validation routines.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - No specific vulnerable code exists within the provided PROJECT FILES. The vulnerability is introduced by developers who *use* this worker to build functions.
    - The PROJECT FILES focus on the worker's infrastructure (build, test, CI/CD), and do not include example Azure Function code that would demonstrate or mitigate injection vulnerabilities.
    - Therefore, a traditional source code analysis of PROJECT FILES will not reveal specific injection vulnerabilities in *this project*. The risk is in the *use* of this project by developers.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Deploy an Azure Function using the Python worker with an HTTP trigger. The function code should be designed to construct a SQL query based on an HTTP request parameter without any input sanitization. For example, the function might take an 'itemName' parameter from the HTTP request and use it directly in a SQL query like: `SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemName = '{itemName}'`.
    - Step 2: Craft a malicious HTTP GET request to the deployed function's endpoint. The request should include a query parameter designed to exploit SQL injection. For instance, append `?itemName='item' OR '1'='1'` to the function URL.
    - Step 3: Send the crafted HTTP GET request to the Azure Function endpoint.
    - Step 4: Observe the function's response. If the function is vulnerable to SQL injection, it might return data beyond what is expected for a legitimate query (e.g., return all items instead of just a specific 'item').
    - Step 5: Examine the logs for the Azure Function execution to confirm that the injected SQL query was executed and to assess the extent of unauthorized data access or manipulation. If successful, this demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability arising from the developer's failure to sanitize inputs when using the Azure Functions Python worker.
