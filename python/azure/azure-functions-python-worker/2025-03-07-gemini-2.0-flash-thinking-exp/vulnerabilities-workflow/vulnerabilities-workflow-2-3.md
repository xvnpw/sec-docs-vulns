### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Missing HTTP Request Sanitization Vulnerability Details
* Description:
    * The Azure Functions Python worker handles HTTP requests to execute Python functions.
    * Attackers might try to exploit the system by sending malicious HTTP requests with crafted parameters.
    * If the Python worker project lacks specific details and test cases for sanitizing HTTP request parameters, it is difficult to assess the real security posture of the system against injection attacks.
    * The current documentation and source code lack specific information on how HTTP request parameters are sanitized before being passed to Python functions.
    * Without proper sanitization, vulnerabilities like code injection or other unintended behaviors could be exploited by attackers.
* Impact:
    * If HTTP request parameters are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or commands through HTTP requests.
    * This could lead to unintended code execution within the function's context, data breaches, or other security compromises.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The project has a SECURITY.md file that instructs users to report security vulnerabilities through MSRC, indicating a commitment to security.
    * The `pip-audit` tool is used in CI pipelines (`win_env_gen.yml`, `macos_64_env_gen.yml`, `nix_env_gen.yml`, `official-build.yml`, `public-build.yml`, `build.yml`) to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, which is a general security measure.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * Specific input sanitization routines or libraries for HTTP request parameters are not explicitly mentioned or evident in the provided project files.
    * Security test cases specifically targeting HTTP parameter injection vulnerabilities are missing from the provided test files.
    * Documentation detailing the implemented sanitization mechanisms for HTTP requests is absent.
* Preconditions:
    * The Azure Functions Python worker must be deployed and accessible to external HTTP requests.
    * A Python function must be configured to be triggered by HTTP requests and process parameters from these requests.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided project files do not include the Python worker source code that handles HTTP requests and parameter parsing. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis of HTTP parameter sanitization is not possible with the given files.
    * The files primarily consist of build configurations, test setups, documentation, and auxiliary scripts, lacking the core Python worker logic.
* Security Test Case:
    * Vulnerability Test Name: HTTP Parameter Injection Test
    * Description: Test for HTTP Parameter Injection vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request.
    * Steps:
        1. Deploy a Python Azure Function that is triggered by HTTP and processes URL parameters. For example, a function that echoes back a parameter value in the HTTP response.
        2. Craft an HTTP GET request to this function with a potentially malicious payload within a URL parameter. For instance: `GET /api/HttpFunction?param='; import os; os.system('malicious_command') #'`.
        3. Send the crafted HTTP request to the deployed Azure Function endpoint.
        4. Analyze the response from the Azure Function.
        5. Observe the logs and behavior of the Azure Function to determine if the malicious payload was executed or caused unintended effects.
        6. Expected Result: The Azure Function should sanitize the input parameter, preventing the execution of the injected payload. The response should not indicate any execution of the malicious command, and system logs should not show any signs of unintended activity. A secure implementation should only echo back the parameter as a string without executing any part of it as code.
        7. If the malicious payload is executed or the system behaves unexpectedly, it confirms the presence of an HTTP Parameter Injection vulnerability.
