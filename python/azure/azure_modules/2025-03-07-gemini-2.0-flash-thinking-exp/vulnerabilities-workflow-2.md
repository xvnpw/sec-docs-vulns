## Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerabilities were identified and combined from the provided lists.

### Vulnerability 1: Vulnerable Azure SDK Dependencies
- **Description:**
  1. An attacker compromises the `requirements-azure.txt` file within the Ansible role repository.
  2. The attacker modifies this file to specify vulnerable versions of Azure Python SDKs.
  3. A user installs the Ansible role.
  4. The user follows the installation instructions and executes the command to install Python dependencies from the compromised `requirements-azure.txt` file.
  5. `pip` installs the vulnerable Azure Python SDK versions.
  6. When Ansible Azure modules from this role are used, they rely on these vulnerable SDKs.
  7. An attacker could then exploit known vulnerabilities in these SDKs to compromise the user's Azure environment.
- **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of the user's Azure environment.
  - An attacker could gain unauthorized access to Azure resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service against Azure services.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None in the project. The project relies on users to download and install `requirements-azure.txt` without any integrity checks or version validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated scanning of `requirements-azure.txt` to detect known vulnerable Python SDK versions before role release.
  - **Version Pinning:** Pin specific, secure versions of Azure SDKs in `requirements-azure.txt` to avoid installing vulnerable versions. Regularly update these pinned versions.
  - **Integrity Check:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of `requirements-azure.txt`, such as checksums or digital signatures.
  - **Documentation:** Enhance the `README.md` to strongly advise users to review `requirements-azure.txt` before installation and install dependencies from trusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker gains write access to the repository to modify `requirements-azure.txt`.
  - A user installs the Ansible role and executes the `pip install` command without reviewing `requirements-azure.txt`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The vulnerability is not in the Ansible role code itself but in the potential content of the external dependency file `requirements-azure.txt`.
  - The `README.md` instructs users to install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements-azure.txt`, creating the attack vector if this file is compromised.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Set up a controlled Ansible test environment and install the `azure.azure_modules` role. Locate `requirements-azure.txt` within the installed role directory.
  2. **Vulnerability Injection:** Replace the content of `requirements-azure.txt` with a modified version that includes a known vulnerable version of an Azure Python SDK (e.g., `azure-mgmt-compute==2.0.0`).
  3. **Test Execution:** Execute the dependency installation command: `pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt`.
  4. **Verification:** After installation, check the installed version of the targeted Azure SDK (e.g., using `pip show azure-mgmt-compute`) to confirm the vulnerable version is installed.
  5. **Expected Result:** The test is successful if the vulnerable SDK version is installed, demonstrating susceptibility to vulnerable dependencies via a compromised `requirements-azure.txt`.

### Vulnerability 2: Use of Development Branch Azure Modules
- **Description:**
  1. The Ansible role installs Azure modules directly from the `devel` branch of the Ansible repository.
  2. Modules in the `devel` branch are under development and testing and are not considered stable.
  3. These modules may contain undiscovered bugs, security vulnerabilities (parameter injection, logic errors, insecure defaults), or be incomplete.
  4. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in these `devel` branch modules to compromise Azure resources managed by Ansible playbooks using this role.
- **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized actions on Azure resources managed by Ansible.
  - This includes unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of critical Azure resources, leading to data loss, service disruption, or financial damage.
  - Information disclosure is also a potential risk, where an attacker could access sensitive configuration details or data within Azure resources.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None within the Ansible role. The role explicitly installs modules from the `devel` branch without security checks or strong warnings beyond a general disclaimer.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Strong Security Warning in README:** Update the README to prominently display a clear and strong security warning about the risks of using `devel` branch modules, stating they are not for production and may contain vulnerabilities.
  - **Vulnerability Scanning/Static Analysis of `devel` Branch Modules:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning and static analysis tools to regularly examine `devel` branch modules before inclusion in this role.
  - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits, focusing on newer Azure modules in this role, including manual code reviews and penetration testing.
  - **User Awareness and Guidance:** Provide clear guidance for users choosing this role, emphasizing thorough testing in non-production, reviewing `devel` branch module code, staying informed about updates, and implementing robust monitoring.
- **Preconditions:**
  1. A user installs the `azure.azure_modules` Ansible role.
  2. The user executes Ansible playbooks utilizing Azure modules from this role (from the `devel` branch).
  3. An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability within a `devel` branch Azure module.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - `/code/README.md`: The README underplays security risks by recommending the role for latest features without strong security warnings.
  - `/code/tasks/main.yml`: Handles dependency installation and version checks but doesn't address the `devel` branch vulnerability.
  - `/code/library` directory: Contains Azure RM Ansible modules. Vulnerabilities could arise from:
    - **Parameter Injection**: Lack of input sanitization in modules before Azure API calls.
    - **Logic Errors**: Flaws in module logic leading to misconfigurations or security bypasses.
    - **Insecure Defaults**: Modules using less secure default settings for Azure resources.
    - **Information Disclosure**: Modules inadvertently exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages.
  - **Visualization:**
    ```
    User (Ansible Playbook) --> Ansible Control Machine --> azure.azure_modules (devel branch modules) --> Azure Resources
                                                                  ^
                                                                  | Potential Vulnerability in devel branch module
    Attacker --> Exploits Vulnerability --> Azure Resources Compromise
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Set up an Ansible control machine with Azure credentials and install the `azure.azure_modules` role. Identify Azure modules in the role (compare to Ansible `devel` branch).
  2. **Vulnerability Research and Selection:** Research Ansible `devel` branch commit history/issue trackers for modules, looking for bug fixes or potential vulnerability areas. Assume a potential vulnerability in `azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset` related to the `capacity` parameter.
  3. **Playbook Creation (Exploit Attempt):** Create a playbook to exploit the potential vulnerability. Example for `azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset` and `capacity`:
     ```yaml
     ---
     - hosts: localhost
       roles:
         - azure.azure_modules
       tasks:
         - name: Attempt to Exploit Capacity Vulnerability in azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset
           azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset:
             resource_group: myResourceGroup
             name: testvmss_vuln_test
             vm_size: Standard_DS1_v2
             capacity: 99999 # Attempting an extremely high capacity - potential exploit
             virtual_network_name: testvnet
             upgrade_policy: Manual
             subnet_name: testsubnet
             admin_username: testadmin
             ssh_password_enabled: false
             image:
               offer: CoreOS
               publisher: CoreOS
               sku: Stable
               version: latest
     ```
  4. **Playbook Execution:** Execute the playbook against the Azure environment.
  5. **Verification and Impact Assessment:** Monitor playbook execution and check Azure portal/CLI for VM scale set state. Verify if `capacity` was set to 99999 or if errors occurred. Analyze results to determine if the exploit was successful in causing unintended impact and document findings.
