- Vulnerability Name: Vulnerable Azure SDK Dependencies
- Description:
  1. An attacker could compromise the `requirements-azure.txt` file in the `files/` directory of the Ansible role within the repository.
  2. The attacker modifies the file to specify vulnerable versions of Azure Python SDKs.
  3. A user installs the Ansible role using `ansible-galaxy install azure.azure_modules`.
  4. The user then follows the installation instructions in the `README.md` and executes the command `pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt` (or `sudo pip install ...`).
  5. `pip` installs the vulnerable Azure Python SDK versions specified in the compromised `requirements-azure.txt` file.
  6. When Ansible Azure modules from this role are used, they rely on these vulnerable SDKs.
  7. An attacker could then exploit known vulnerabilities in these SDKs to compromise the user's Azure environment.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of the user's Azure environment.
  - An attacker could gain unauthorized access to Azure resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service against Azure services.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the provided project files. The project relies on users to download and install `requirements-azure.txt` without any integrity checks or version validation within the Ansible role itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated scanning of `requirements-azure.txt` to detect known vulnerable Python SDK versions before role release.
  - **Version Pinning:** Pin specific, secure versions of Azure SDKs in `requirements-azure.txt` to avoid inadvertently installing vulnerable versions. Periodically update these pinned versions to the latest secure versions.
  - **Integrity Check:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of `requirements-azure.txt` file, such as using a checksum or digital signature, to ensure it has not been tampered with.
  - **Documentation:** Enhance the `README.md` to strongly advise users to review the `requirements-azure.txt` file before installation and to install dependencies from trusted sources.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker gains write access to the repository to modify the `requirements-azure.txt` file.
  - A user installs the Ansible role and blindly executes the `pip install` command as instructed in `README.md` without reviewing the `requirements-azure.txt` file.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not contain a `requirements-azure.txt` file, so direct source code analysis of vulnerable dependencies within this file is not possible with the given files.
  - The vulnerability is not within the Python or YAML code of the Ansible role itself, but rather in the potential content of the external dependency file `requirements-azure.txt` and the lack of security measures around it.
  - The `README.md` file instructs users to install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements-azure.txt`, which is the attack vector if `requirements-azure.txt` is compromised.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Set up a controlled Ansible test environment.
     - Install the `azure.azure_modules` role using `ansible-galaxy install azure.azure_modules`.
     - Locate the `requirements-azure.txt` file within the installed role directory (e.g., `~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt`).
  2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
     - Replace the content of `requirements-azure.txt` with a modified version that includes a known vulnerable version of an Azure Python SDK, for example, an older version of `azure-mgmt-compute` with a known vulnerability (if such a version exists and is publicly known). Example content for `requirements-azure.txt`:
       ```
       azure-mgmt-compute==2.0.0 # Vulnerable version
       # ... other dependencies ...
       ```
  3. **Test Execution:**
     - Execute the dependency installation command as instructed in the `README.md`:
       ```bash
       pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt
       ```
     - Or with sudo if required:
       ```bash
       sudo pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt
       ```
  4. **Verification:**
     - After the `pip install` command completes, check the installed versions of Azure SDKs, specifically the one you intentionally made vulnerable (e.g., `azure-mgmt-compute`). You can use `pip show azure-mgmt-compute` to check the installed version.
     - Verify that the vulnerable version specified in the modified `requirements-azure.txt` is indeed installed.
  5. **Expected Result:**
     - The test is successful if the vulnerable version of the Azure SDK is installed, demonstrating that the project is susceptible to installing vulnerable dependencies if `requirements-azure.txt` is compromised.
     - This confirms the vulnerability: users are able to install vulnerable Azure SDKs by using a maliciously modified `requirements-azure.txt` file from this Ansible role.
