- Vulnerability Name: SpreadsheetChunker XLSX Processing Vulnerability
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a malicious XLSX file to the data ingestion pipeline.
    2. The system identifies the file extension as `.xlsx` and routes it to the `SpreadsheetChunker`.
    3. The `SpreadsheetChunker`, using `openpyxl` library, attempts to parse the malicious XLSX file.
    4. If the malicious XLSX file is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in `openpyxl` (e.g., XML External Entity injection, arbitrary code execution during parsing), it could lead to unauthorized actions on the server or denial of service.
- Impact:
    - High: Depending on the nature of the `openpyxl` vulnerability, an attacker could potentially achieve:
        - Arbitrary code execution on the function app instance.
        - Read sensitive data from the function app environment.
        - Modify data within the function app's resources.
        - Cause a denial of service by crashing the function app or consuming excessive resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code provided does not include specific mitigations against XLSX parsing vulnerabilities in `SpreadsheetChunker`. The reliance on `openpyxl` without explicit security measures makes it vulnerable to exploits in that library.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement validation of XLSX files before parsing to check for malicious content or structural anomalies.
    - Library security updates: Regularly update `openpyxl` library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Process XLSX files in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    - File scanning: Integrate with a malware scanning service to detect malicious files before processing.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can upload documents to the data ingestion pipeline (e.g., via blob storage upload if publicly accessible, or through SharePoint connector if attacker has access).
    - The system is configured to process `.xlsx` files using `SpreadsheetChunker`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/chunking/chunkers/spreadsheet_chunker.py
    Content:
    ...
    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    ...
    class SpreadsheetChunker(BaseChunker):
        ...
        def _spreadsheet_process(self):
            ...
            blob_data = self.document_bytes
            blob_stream = BytesIO(blob_data)
            logging.debug(f"[spreadsheet_chunker][{self.filename}][spreadsheet_process] Starting openpyxl load_workbook.")
            workbook = load_workbook(blob_stream, data_only=True) # Vulnerable line
            ...
    ```
    - The `SpreadsheetChunker` utilizes the `openpyxl.load_workbook` function to process XLSX files.
    - The `data_only=True` argument is used, which might mitigate certain formula-related attacks but does not prevent all potential vulnerabilities in `openpyxl`'s XML parsing or file structure handling.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the uploaded XLSX file before it is processed by `load_workbook`.
    - If a malicious XLSX file exploits a vulnerability within `openpyxl` during the `load_workbook` call, it could lead to security breaches.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious XLSX file specifically crafted to exploit a known vulnerability in `openpyxl` (if available and ethical to test) or a generic XLSX vulnerability (e.g., large file causing resource exhaustion, or file with excessive external references if `data_only=False` was used). For ethical reasons, testing with a known vulnerability should be done in a controlled, isolated environment. For production systems, generic malicious file testing should be performed.
    2. Upload the malicious XLSX file to the document blob storage container used by the data ingestion pipeline. Assume an attacker can upload files to this location.
    3. Trigger the data ingestion process, either by waiting for scheduled indexing or manually triggering the indexer if possible (e.g., via a function endpoint if exposed).
    4. Monitor the function app logs and infrastructure for any signs of exploit, such as:
        - Errors or exceptions related to `openpyxl` during file processing.
        - Unexpected function app behavior or crashes.
        - Unauthorized network activity originating from the function app.
        - Resource exhaustion (high CPU, memory usage) on the function app instance.
    5. If the logs or monitoring indicate an anomaly during or after processing the malicious XLSX file, it suggests a potential vulnerability. Further investigation and deeper analysis of `openpyxl` and the specific exploit used are required to confirm and quantify the vulnerability. For a real exploit, successful demonstration would involve observing code execution or data access beyond the intended scope of the application. For denial of service, observe function app crashes or timeouts.
