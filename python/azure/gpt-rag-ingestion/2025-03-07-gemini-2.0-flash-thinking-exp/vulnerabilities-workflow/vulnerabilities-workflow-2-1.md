### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: File Extension Mismatch Vulnerability
- Description: The data ingestion component relies on the file extension extracted from the `documentUrl` to determine the appropriate chunker for processing documents. This mechanism can be exploited by an attacker who uploads a malicious file but disguises its true file type by providing a misleading file extension in the URL. For instance, a PDF file containing malicious content could be uploaded with a `.txt` extension. Consequently, the system might incorrectly select a chunker intended for text files (like `LangChainChunker`) instead of the one designed for PDFs (`DocAnalysisChunker`). This bypasses format-specific security measures that might be implemented in the intended chunker and could lead to unexpected or insecure processing of the malicious content.
- Impact: By misdirecting the document processing to an inappropriate chunker, an attacker can potentially bypass security checks or trigger vulnerabilities specific to the chosen chunker when handling a file type it was not designed for. This could result in various security impacts, including but not limited to:
    - Information Disclosure: If the incorrect chunker improperly handles the file, it might expose sensitive information contained within the malicious file that would otherwise be secured by the correct parser.
    - Code Execution: In a more severe scenario, vulnerabilities within the misused chunker, when processing an unexpected file type, could be exploited to achieve code execution on the server.
    - Data Corruption: Improper processing could lead to the corruption of data within the system's index or storage.
    - Service Disruption: Though not a denial-of-service vulnerability in the traditional sense, incorrect processing could lead to application errors or instability, disrupting the service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - JSON schema validation is implemented in the `document_chunking` Azure Function to validate the structure of the incoming request body. This validation ensures that the request adheres to the expected format, including the presence of `documentUrl` and `documentContentType`. However, this schema validation does not verify the consistency between the declared `documentContentType`, the file extension in `documentUrl`, and the actual content of the file.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Content-Based File Type Detection**: Implement content-based file type detection to verify the actual file type regardless of the declared extension or `documentContentType`. This can be achieved by inspecting the file's magic numbers or using libraries specialized in file type identification.
    - **File Extension and Content-Type Consistency Check**: Validate that the file extension derived from the `documentUrl` is consistent with the `documentContentType` provided in the request. Warn or reject the request if inconsistencies are detected.
    - **Filename and Extension Sanitization**: Sanitize the filename and extension extracted from the `documentUrl` to prevent manipulation attempts, such as stripping potentially misleading characters or enforcing allowed extension lists.
    - **Chunker-Specific Input Validation**: Implement input validation within each chunker to ensure that the content being processed conforms to the expected format for that chunker. This would act as a defense-in-depth measure if a file is misrouted to an incorrect chunker.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to upload documents or provide document URLs to the data ingestion pipeline. This is typically done via the user interface or API exposed by the GPT-RAG application for document ingestion.
    - The target system must rely on the file extension from the `documentUrl` to select the chunker, as is the current design.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Chunker Selection in `chunking/chunker_factory.py`**:
        ```python
        def get_chunker(self, data):
            filename = get_filename_from_data(data)
            extension = get_file_extension(filename)
            if extension == 'vtt':
                return TranscriptionChunker(data)
            elif extension == 'json':
                return JSONChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('xlsx', 'xls'):
                return SpreadsheetChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('pdf', 'png', 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'bmp', 'tiff'):
                if self.multimodality:
                    return MultimodalChunker(data)
                else:
                    return DocAnalysisChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('docx', 'pptx'):
                if self.docint_40_api:
                    if self.multimodality:
                        return MultimodalChunker(data)
                    else:
                        return DocAnalysisChunker(data)
                else:
                    logging.info(f"[chunker_factory][{filename}] Processing 'pptx' and 'docx' files requires Doc Intelligence 4.0.")
                    raise RuntimeError("Processing 'pptx' and 'docx' files requires Doc Intelligence 4.0.")
            elif extension in ('nl2sql'):
                return NL2SQLChunker(data)
            else:
                return LangChainChunker(data)
        ```
        - This code snippet from `chunking/chunker_factory.py` clearly shows that the chunker selection is solely based on the file extension obtained from `get_file_extension(filename)`.
    - **Filename Extraction in `utils/file_utils.py`**:
        ```python
        def get_filename_from_data(data: dict) -> str:
            if data.get('fileName'):
                filename = data['fileName']
            else:
                filename = data['documentUrl'].split('/')[-1]
            return filename

        def get_file_extension(file_path: str) -> Optional[str]:
            file_path = os.path.basename(file_path)
            return file_path.split(".")[-1].lower()
        ```
        - The `get_filename_from_data` function retrieves the filename, and `get_file_extension` extracts the extension based on the filename. The filename is primarily derived from `documentUrl`, making the chunker selection dependent on the URL.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Ensure you have access to an instance of the GPT-RAG Data Ingestion component.
        - Prepare a malicious PDF file. For demonstration purposes, a simple PDF file that is designed to be processed incorrectly by a text chunker will suffice. A more sophisticated exploit could be crafted for a real-world scenario.
        - Upload the malicious PDF to an accessible Azure Blob Storage container.
    2. **Craft Malicious Request**:
        - Construct an HTTP POST request to the `document-chunking` Azure Function endpoint.
        - In the request body, provide the following JSON structure, modifying the `documentUrl` and `documentContentType` to mislead the system:
          ```json
          {
            "values": [
              {
                "recordId": "test-record-1",
                "data": {
                  "documentUrl": "URL_OF_MALICIOUS_PDF_IN_BLOB_STORAGE/malicious.txt",
                  "documentContentType": "text/plain"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
          ```
          - Replace `URL_OF_MALICIOUS_PDF_IN_BLOB_STORAGE/malicious.txt` with the actual URL to your malicious PDF file in Azure Blob Storage, ensuring the URL path ends with `.txt` to mimic a text file extension.
    3. **Send Request**:
        - Send the crafted HTTP POST request to the `document-chunking` function endpoint.
    4. **Analyze Results**:
        - Monitor the application logs for the `document-chunking` function.
        - Verify if the logs indicate that the `LangChainChunker` (or another text-based chunker) was invoked instead of `DocAnalysisChunker`. The logs might show messages indicating the chunker type being used for processing.
        - Observe if any errors or unexpected behaviors occur during the chunking process that are indicative of processing a PDF file as plain text. For instance, errors from the text splitter trying to parse binary PDF content, or malformed chunks being generated.
    5. **Expected Outcome**:
        - The expected outcome is that the system attempts to process the PDF file using a text-based chunker due to the misleading `.txt` extension in the `documentUrl` and the `documentContentType` being set to `text/plain`. This will be evident from the logs indicating the use of `LangChainChunker` and potentially errors or warnings during processing, confirming the File Extension Mismatch Vulnerability. If successful, further tests with more sophisticated malicious PDF files could be conducted to explore the full impact.
