### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Document Type Handling in Document Chunking Function
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a document to the blob storage container.
    2. The Azure AI Search indexer picks up the document and triggers the `document-chunking` function via HTTP request.
    3. The HTTP request to `document-chunking` function includes `documentContentType` parameter, which is supposed to indicate the MIME type of the uploaded document.
    4. The `document_chunking` function uses the `documentContentType` parameter to determine how to process the document (which chunker to use).
    5. If an attacker can manipulate or forge the `documentContentType` to an unexpected value (e.g., sending a malicious PDF but claiming it's a TXT file), the `document_chunking` function might apply an inappropriate chunking logic.
    6. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors in processing, or potentially bypass security checks if different chunkers have different vulnerability profiles. While not directly exploitable for code execution in this specific code, it represents a weakness in input validation and could be a stepping stone for more complex exploits if chunkers themselves had format-specific vulnerabilities.
- Impact:
    - Incorrect document processing: Documents might be chunked improperly, leading to degraded search quality and inaccurate RAG results.
    - Potential for future exploitation: While not directly exploitable to gain system access in this code, this input validation weakness could become a vulnerability if specific chunkers are found to have vulnerabilities that are format-dependent. For instance, if a chunker designed for TXT files has a vulnerability that is not present in the PDF chunker, misrepresenting a malicious PDF as TXT could theoretically bypass intended security paths.
    - Reduced confidence in system integrity: Unvalidated input types can undermine the robustness and predictability of the data ingestion pipeline.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code relies on the `documentContentType` provided by the upstream Azure AI Search indexer without additional validation within the `document_chunking` function itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement server-side validation within the `document_chunking` function to verify that the `documentContentType` is expected and safe.
    - Ideally, derive the document type from the actual file content (magic number detection) or file extension after retrieving the document bytes, instead of relying solely on the `documentContentType` passed in the request.
    - Whitelist the allowed `documentContentType` values to only those that are expected and supported by the system.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to upload a document to the blob storage that is being monitored by the Azure AI Search indexer.
    - The attacker needs to understand how the `documentContentType` is used by the `document_chunking` function and be able to influence or observe the HTTP request sent to the function (which is typically internal to Azure AI Search service, making direct manipulation harder for external attackers but still relevant in terms of security best practices).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Entry Point: `document_chunking` function in `/code/function_app.py`**:
        ```python
        @app.route(route="document-chunking", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
        def document_chunking(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
            try:
                body = req.get_json()
                jsonschema.validate(body, schema=get_request_schema())
                # ...
                if body:
                    # ...
                    input_data = item["data"]
                    filename = get_filename(input_data["documentUrl"])
                    logging.info(f'[document_chunking_function] Chunking document: File {filename}, Content Type {input_data["documentContentType"]}.')
                    # ...
                    chunks, errors, warnings = DocumentChunker().chunk_documents(input_data)
                    # ...
        ```
        - The `document_chunking` function retrieves `documentContentType` directly from the `input_data` which is derived from the request body.
        - The log message explicitly shows that the function is using `input_data["documentContentType"]` for chunking decisions.

    2. **Chunker Selection in `ChunkerFactory` in `/code/chunking/chunker_factory.py`**:
        ```python
        class ChunkerFactory:
            # ...
            def get_chunker(self, data):
                """
                Get the appropriate chunker based on the file extension.
                """
                filename = get_filename_from_data(data)
                extension = get_file_extension(filename)
                if extension == 'vtt':
                    return TranscriptionChunker(data)
                elif extension == 'json':
                    return JSONChunker(data)
                # ...
                elif extension in ('pdf', 'png', 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'bmp', 'tiff'):
                    if self.multimodality:
                        return MultimodalChunker(data)
                    else:
                        return DocAnalysisChunker(data)
                # ...
                else:
                    return LangChainChunker(data)
        ```
        - The `ChunkerFactory` uses `get_file_extension(filename)` to determine the chunker.
        - `get_filename_from_data(data)` in `/code/utils/file_utils.py` in turn extracts filename from `data['fileName']` or `data['documentUrl']`.
        - **Crucially**, the `documentContentType` itself is not directly used in chunker selection logic in `ChunkerFactory`. However, the *filename* and its *extension* are derived from `documentUrl` which comes in the input data. If `documentContentType` is misleading and not consistent with the actual file type at the URL, the *expectation* of the system based on `documentContentType` might be violated even if chunker selection is based on filename.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious PDF File**: Create a simple PDF file that does not contain any malicious payloads for this test, but can be easily identified (e.g., a PDF with just the text "TEST PDF").
    2. **Upload the PDF to Blob Storage**: Upload this PDF file to the `documents` blob container used by the data ingestion pipeline. Let's say the blob URL is `https://<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/documents/test.pdf`.
    3. **Trigger Indexing (Simulate or Wait for Timer)**:
        - To simulate the scenario directly (if possible in your test environment), you would need to manually trigger the `document-chunking` function with a crafted HTTP request.
        - For a more realistic test against a live system, you can wait for the Azure AI Search indexer to pick up the new PDF file and automatically trigger the `document-chunking` function.
    4. **Intercept/Observe the HTTP Request**:
        - In a real-world scenario, observing the exact HTTP request from Azure AI Search to the function app might be challenging for an external attacker. However, for a security test, you can configure logging or use network monitoring tools within the Azure environment to observe the request details.
        - Focus on observing the `documentContentType` value in the request body when the PDF is being processed.
    5. **Craft Malicious Request (if direct triggering is possible)**:
        - If you can directly trigger the `document-chunking` function (e.g., in a local development setup or a controlled test environment), craft an HTTP POST request to the function endpoint.
        - In the request body, include the `documentUrl` of your uploaded PDF (`https://<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/documents/test.pdf`).
        - **Crucially, set the `documentContentType` in the request body to an incorrect value,** for example, `text/plain`.
        - Send this crafted request to the `document_chunking` function.
    6. **Analyze Index Output**:
        - After the ingestion process completes (either by direct triggering or automatic indexing), examine the Azure AI Search index.
        - Search for chunks related to `test.pdf` (e.g., by `metadata_storage_name:test.pdf`).
        - Check how the PDF content was chunked. If the `documentContentType` manipulation was effective, you might see:
            - The PDF content being treated as plain text, possibly losing structure and formatting expected from PDF processing.
            - Errors or warnings in the function logs related to unexpected content when processed as plain text (if the plain text chunker attempts to process binary PDF data as text).
        7. **Expected Outcome**:
            - The test should demonstrate that the `document_chunking` function *relies* on the `documentContentType` provided in the request, even if it's not directly used for chunker *selection* in the provided code snippet.
            - While this specific test might not reveal a critical exploit (like code execution), it validates the input validation weakness: the system trusts the provided `documentContentType` without re-verifying or sanitizing it against the actual file content.
            - The impact is primarily on data integrity and potential for future, more severe vulnerabilities if chunkers had format-specific exploits.
