### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: File Extension Mismatch Vulnerability
- Description: The data ingestion component uses the file extension from the `documentUrl` to select the appropriate chunker for processing documents. An attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious file and providing a misleading file extension in the URL. For example, a PDF file with malicious content could be uploaded with a `.txt` extension. The system might then incorrectly choose a text file chunker (like `LangChainChunker`) instead of the PDF chunker (`DocAnalysisChunker`). This bypasses format-specific security measures and could lead to insecure processing of the malicious content.
- Impact: Misdirecting document processing to an incorrect chunker can bypass security checks and trigger vulnerabilities. This can lead to:
    - Information Disclosure: Incorrect chunker might expose sensitive information within the malicious file.
    - Code Execution: Vulnerabilities in the misused chunker could be exploited to achieve code execution.
    - Data Corruption: Improper processing could corrupt data in the system's index or storage.
    - Service Disruption: Incorrect processing can lead to application errors and instability.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: JSON schema validation in the `document_chunking` Azure Function validates the request structure, including `documentUrl` and `documentContentType`. However, it does not verify consistency between `documentContentType`, file extension, and actual file content.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Content-Based File Type Detection**: Implement content-based file type detection to verify the actual file type.
    - **File Extension and Content-Type Consistency Check**: Validate consistency between file extension from `documentUrl` and `documentContentType`.
    - **Filename and Extension Sanitization**: Sanitize filename and extension from `documentUrl` to prevent manipulation.
    - **Chunker-Specific Input Validation**: Implement input validation within each chunker to ensure content conforms to the expected format.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can upload documents or provide document URLs to the data ingestion pipeline.
    - The system relies on file extension from `documentUrl` for chunker selection.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Chunker Selection in `chunking/chunker_factory.py`**:
        ```python
        def get_chunker(self, data):
            filename = get_filename_from_data(data)
            extension = get_file_extension(filename)
            if extension == 'vtt':
                return TranscriptionChunker(data)
            elif extension == 'json':
                return JSONChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('xlsx', 'xls'):
                return SpreadsheetChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('pdf', 'png', 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'bmp', 'tiff'):
                if self.multimodality:
                    return MultimodalChunker(data)
                else:
                    return DocAnalysisChunker(data)
            elif extension in ('docx', 'pptx'):
                if self.docint_40_api:
                    if self.multimodality:
                        return MultimodalChunker(data)
                    else:
                        return DocAnalysisChunker(data)
                else:
                    logging.info(f"[chunker_factory][{filename}] Processing 'pptx' and 'docx' files requires Doc Intelligence 4.0.")
                    raise RuntimeError("Processing 'pptx' and 'docx' files requires Doc Intelligence 4.0.")
            elif extension in ('nl2sql'):
                return NL2SQLChunker(data)
            else:
                return LangChainChunker(data)
        ```
        The code shows chunker selection based solely on file extension from `get_file_extension(filename)`.
    - **Filename Extraction in `utils/file_utils.py`**:
        ```python
        def get_filename_from_data(data: dict) -> str:
            if data.get('fileName'):
                filename = data['fileName']
            else:
                filename = data['documentUrl'].split('/')[-1]
            return filename

        def get_file_extension(file_path: str) -> Optional[str]:
            file_path = os.path.basename(file_path)
            return file_path.split(".")[-1].lower()
        ```
        Filename and extension are extracted from `documentUrl`, making chunker selection dependent on the URL.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Access to GPT-RAG Data Ingestion component, prepare a malicious PDF file, upload to Azure Blob Storage.
    2. **Craft Malicious Request**: HTTP POST to `document-chunking` function with JSON body:
       ```json
       {
         "values": [
           {
             "recordId": "test-record-1",
             "data": {
               "documentUrl": "URL_OF_MALICIOUS_PDF_IN_BLOB_STORAGE/malicious.txt",
               "documentContentType": "text/plain"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
       Replace `URL_OF_MALICIOUS_PDF_IN_BLOB_STORAGE/malicious.txt` with the actual URL, ensuring `.txt` extension.
    3. **Send Request**: Send the crafted HTTP POST request.
    4. **Analyze Results**: Monitor application logs for `document-chunking` function. Verify if `LangChainChunker` (or text-based chunker) was invoked instead of `DocAnalysisChunker`. Observe errors or unexpected behaviors indicative of processing PDF as text.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: System attempts to process PDF with text-based chunker due to misleading `.txt` extension, evident in logs and potential errors, confirming File Extension Mismatch Vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Deserialization in JSON Chunker
- Description:
    1. Attacker uploads a crafted JSON file to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in `JSONChunker`.
    2. `document_chunking` function routes the document to `JSONChunker` based on file extension.
    3. `JSONChunker` uses `json.loads()` to parse JSON without sanitization.
    4. Malicious JSON payloads can exploit vulnerabilities in the JSON deserialization library or Python environment, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. Potential for system compromise, data breach, and unauthorized access.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. `json.loads()` is used directly without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for JSON files.
    - Use safer JSON parsing methods or libraries.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if applicable.
- Preconditions:
    - Application processes JSON files using `JSONChunker`.
    - Attacker can upload JSON files to the data ingestion component.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/chunking/chunkers/json_chunker.py`
    ```python
    import json
    # ...
    class JSONChunker(BaseChunker):
        # ...
        def get_chunks(self):
            # ...
            blob_data = self.document_bytes
            text = self.decode_to_utf8(blob_data)
            try:
                json_data = json.loads(text) # Vulnerable line: Unsafe deserialization
                logging.debug(f"[json_chunker][{{self.filename}}] Successfully parsed JSON data.")
            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                logging.error(f"[json_chunker][{{self.filename}}] Failed to parse JSON data: {{e}}")
                return chunks
            # ...
    ```
    `JSONChunker.get_chunks()` uses `json.loads(text)` for deserialization without sanitization, which is unsafe for untrusted JSON content.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious JSON file (e.g., `malicious.json`) with a deserialization exploit payload.
    2. Upload `malicious.json` to the data ingestion endpoint.
    3. Monitor server-side logs and system behavior for payload execution or unexpected behavior.
    4. Successful exploit leads to arbitrary code execution on the server, demonstrated by server logs or out-of-band callback.

- Vulnerability Name: SpreadsheetChunker XLSX Processing Vulnerability
- Description:
    1. Attacker uploads a malicious XLSX file to the data ingestion pipeline.
    2. System routes the file to `SpreadsheetChunker` based on `.xlsx` extension.
    3. `SpreadsheetChunker` uses `openpyxl` to parse the XLSX file.
    4. Malicious XLSX file exploiting `openpyxl` vulnerabilities (e.g., XXE, RCE during parsing) can lead to unauthorized actions or denial of service.
- Impact:
    - High: Potential for arbitrary code execution, sensitive data access, data modification, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. No specific mitigations against XLSX parsing vulnerabilities in `SpreadsheetChunker`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for XLSX files.
    - Regularly update `openpyxl` library.
    - Sandbox XLSX file processing.
    - Integrate malware scanning service.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can upload documents to the data ingestion pipeline.
    - System processes `.xlsx` files using `SpreadsheetChunker`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/chunking/chunkers/spreadsheet_chunker.py
    Content:
    ...
    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    ...
    class SpreadsheetChunker(BaseChunker):
        ...
        def _spreadsheet_process(self):
            ...
            blob_data = self.document_bytes
            blob_stream = BytesIO(blob_data)
            logging.debug(f"[spreadsheet_chunker][{self.filename}][spreadsheet_process] Starting openpyxl load_workbook.")
            workbook = load_workbook(blob_stream, data_only=True) # Vulnerable line
            ...
    ```
    `SpreadsheetChunker` uses `openpyxl.load_workbook` to process XLSX files without input validation. `data_only=True` might mitigate formula attacks but not all `openpyxl` vulnerabilities.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious XLSX file exploiting `openpyxl` vulnerability (or generic XLSX vulnerability for resource exhaustion). Test known vulnerabilities ethically in isolated environment.
    2. Upload malicious XLSX to document blob storage.
    3. Trigger data ingestion process (wait for schedule or manual trigger).
    4. Monitor function app logs and infrastructure for exploit signs: `openpyxl` errors, unexpected behavior, crashes, unauthorized network activity, resource exhaustion.
    5. Anomalies suggest potential vulnerability, requiring further investigation. Successful exploit demonstrated by code execution or data access beyond application scope. Denial of service shown by crashes or timeouts.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Document Type Handling in Document Chunking Function
- Description:
    1. Attacker uploads document to blob storage.
    2. Azure AI Search indexer triggers `document-chunking` function via HTTP request with `documentContentType`.
    3. `document_chunking` function uses `documentContentType` to determine processing logic.
    4. Attacker can forge `documentContentType` to an unexpected value (e.g., malicious PDF as TXT).
    5. Inappropriate chunking logic applied, leading to unexpected behavior, errors, or bypassed security checks if chunkers have format-specific vulnerabilities.
- Impact:
    - Incorrect document processing: Degraded search quality and inaccurate RAG results due to improper chunking.
    - Potential for future exploitation: Input validation weakness could become vulnerability if chunkers have format-dependent exploits.
    - Reduced system integrity: Unvalidated input types undermine robustness.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. Relies on `documentContentType` from Azure AI Search indexer without validation in `document_chunking` function.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Server-side validation of `documentContentType` within `document_chunking` function.
    - Derive document type from file content (magic number detection) or file extension after retrieving document bytes.
    - Whitelist allowed `documentContentType` values.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can upload document to blob storage monitored by Azure AI Search indexer.
    - Attacker understands `documentContentType` usage and can influence HTTP request (internal to Azure AI Search, harder for external attackers).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Entry Point: `document_chunking` function in `/code/function_app.py`**: Function retrieves `documentContentType` from request body and logs it.
    2. **Chunker Selection in `ChunkerFactory` in `/code/chunking/chunker_factory.py`**: Chunker selection based on file extension from `documentUrl`, not directly on `documentContentType`. However, misleading `documentContentType` can still violate system expectations.
    **Visualization**:

    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious PDF File**: Create a simple PDF file.
    2. **Upload PDF to Blob Storage**: Upload to `documents` blob container. Blob URL: `https://<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/documents/test.pdf`.
    3. **Trigger Indexing**: Simulate trigger or wait for Azure AI Search indexer.
    4. **Intercept/Observe HTTP Request**: Observe `documentContentType` value in request body.
    5. **Craft Malicious Request (if direct triggering possible)**: HTTP POST to function endpoint with:
        - `documentUrl`: `https://<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/documents/test.pdf`
        - `documentContentType`: `text/plain` (incorrect value)
    6. **Analyze Index Output**: Examine Azure AI Search index for chunks related to `test.pdf`. Check for PDF content treated as plain text or errors in logs.
    7. **Expected Outcome**: `document_chunking` function relies on provided `documentContentType` even if not directly for chunker selection, demonstrating input validation weakness. Impact is data integrity and potential for future vulnerabilities.
