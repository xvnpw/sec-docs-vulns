- Vulnerability Name: **Kubeconfig Manipulation via Codespace Connect Script**
- Description:
    1. The `codespace_connect.sh` script copies kubeconfig from a remote codespace to the user's local machine.
    2. The script then replaces the `0.0.0.0` IP address in the local kubeconfig with `127.0.0.1`.
    3. If an attacker can compromise the GitHub Codespace environment or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the `gh codespace cp` command execution, they could potentially inject a malicious kubeconfig file.
    4. This malicious kubeconfig could contain altered server addresses or command execution paths, potentially redirecting the user's `az iot ops` commands to an attacker-controlled Kubernetes cluster or executing arbitrary commands within the user's cluster context if commands are directly embedded.
    5. Upon using `az iot ops` commands, the Azure CLI extension would use this manipulated kubeconfig, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access or control over the user's Kubernetes cluster if the user is tricked into using the modified kubeconfig.
- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the user's Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete cluster takeover, depending on the permissions associated with the manipulated kubeconfig context.
- Vulnerability Rank: **High**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: The script itself does not implement any security measures to prevent kubeconfig manipulation during the copy process or validation of the kubeconfig content.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Check**: Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification) on the kubeconfig file after copying to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Secure Copy Channel**: Ensure the `gh codespace cp` command uses a secure channel (e.g., SSH) to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Although `gh codespace cp` uses SSH, the script doesn't explicitly enforce or verify this.
    - **Kubeconfig Validation**: Implement validation of the kubeconfig file's contents to detect and reject potentially malicious configurations before using it with `az iot ops` commands. This could include checking for unusual server addresses or embedded commands.
- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to compromise the GitHub Codespace environment or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the execution of `codespace_connect.sh`.
    2. The user must execute the `codespace_connect.sh` script and subsequently use `az iot ops` commands relying on the manipulated kubeconfig.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```sh
    File: /code/tools/codespace_connect.sh

    ...
    # Copy kubeconfig from codespace
    TRIES=0
    MAX_TRIES=6
    SLEEP=10s
    echo "Copying $REMOTE_KUBECONF from codespace $CODESPACE_NAME to local $LOCAL_KUBECONF"
    until gh codespace cp -e "remote:$REMOTE_KUBECONF" -e $LOCAL_KUBECONF -c $CODESPACE_NAME
    do
        ...
    done

    # Update local IP
    echo "Updating localhost endpoint in local config $LOCAL_KUBECONF"
    sed -i -e "s/0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1/g" "$LOCAL_KUBECONF"
    ...
    ```
    - The script uses `gh codespace cp` to copy the kubeconfig file. This command, while using SSH, relies on the security of the `gh` CLI and the GitHub Codespaces environment.
    - The `sed` command blindly replaces `0.0.0.0` with `127.0.0.1` without validating the kubeconfig content, opening a door for manipulation if the copied file is already malicious.
    - There are no checks to validate the integrity or authenticity of the kubeconfig file obtained from the codespace.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        - Set up a malicious GitHub Codespace environment.
        - Modify the kubeconfig file within the codespace to point to an attacker-controlled Kubernetes cluster or include malicious commands.
        - Host the malicious Codespace environment on a publicly accessible GitHub repository.
    2. **Victim Action**:
        - The victim user, intending to use Azure IoT Operations extension with Codespaces, executes the `codespace_connect.sh` script, targeting the attacker's malicious repository or Codespace name.
        ```sh
        codespace_connect.sh -r attacker-org/malicious-repo -b main
        ```
        or
        ```sh
        codespace_connect.sh -c malicious-codespace-name
        ```
        - The script copies the malicious kubeconfig to `~/.kube/config`.
    3. **Exploitation**:
        - The victim user then executes an Azure IoT Operations command, for example:
        ```sh
        az iot ops check
        ```
        - If the malicious kubeconfig redirects to an attacker's cluster, the command will be executed against the attacker's infrastructure, potentially sending sensitive information to the attacker or executing malicious actions on the attacker's behalf if the attacker spoofs responses.
        - Alternatively, if the malicious kubeconfig contains embedded commands, these commands might be executed within the victim's cluster context, granting the attacker unauthorized access or control.
    4. **Verification**:
        - Observe that `az iot ops check` command interacts with the attacker's Kubernetes cluster (if redirection attack) or that malicious commands from kubeconfig are executed in the victim's cluster (if command injection attack).
        - Verify that there are no integrity checks or validations in the `codespace_connect.sh` script to prevent kubeconfig manipulation.
