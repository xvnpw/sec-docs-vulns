## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Kubeconfig Exposure via Default Location
- Description: The Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI relies on the default kubeconfig file located at `~/.kube/config` to manage Kubernetes clusters. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's local filesystem, they could potentially steal this kubeconfig file. This stolen kubeconfig could then be used to bypass authentication and authorization controls, granting the attacker full administrative access to the targeted Kubernetes cluster without proper authorization.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete, unauthorized administrative access to the Kubernetes cluster managed by the Azure IoT Operations extension. This can lead to severe security breaches, including:
    - Full cluster compromise and control.
    - Unauthorized deployment or modification of applications and services within the cluster.
    - Exfiltration of sensitive data stored within the cluster.
    - Denial-of-service attacks against the cluster and its hosted applications.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented within the provided project files to address this vulnerability. The project relies on the standard Kubernetes tooling and default kubeconfig location as mentioned in the README.md.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Kubeconfig Storage**: The extension should not solely rely on the default kubeconfig location. Implement mechanisms to encourage or enforce secure storage of kubeconfig files, potentially outside of the user's home directory or using encrypted storage.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: The extension should operate with the minimal Kubernetes permissions necessary. Avoid requiring or encouraging users to grant cluster-admin privileges via kubeconfig when connecting the CLI extension.
    - **Alternative Authentication Methods**: Explore and implement more secure authentication methods that do not rely on static kubeconfig files, such as integration with Azure Active Directory (AAD) or other centralized identity providers for Kubernetes access control.
    - **User Security Guidance**: Provide clear and prominent documentation to users detailing the security risks associated with kubeconfig file exposure. Recommend best practices for securing kubeconfig files, such as restricting file system permissions, using dedicated credentials with limited scope, and avoiding storage in default locations.
- Preconditions:
    - The Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI is installed and configured to manage one or more Kubernetes clusters using kubeconfig files.
    - The user has a kubeconfig file present in the default location (`~/.kube/config`) or another location accessible by the extension.
    - An external attacker gains unauthorized read access to the filesystem of the user's machine where the kubeconfig file is stored. This could be achieved through various attack vectors such as malware, phishing, social engineering, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain local access.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - Step 1: The `README.md` file explicitly states that the extension uses the default kubeconfig location: "ðŸ‘‰ To maintain minimum friction between K8s tools, the `az iot ops` edge side commands are designed to make use of your existing kube config (typically located at `~/.kube/config`)."
        - Step 2: The documentation further mentions the `--context` parameter as an optional way to specify a kubeconfig context, implying that the extension directly interfaces with kubeconfig files for cluster management. "All k8s interaction commands include an optional `--context` param. If none is provided `current_context` as defined in the kube config will be used."
        - Visualization:
        ```
        User's Machine --> Filesystem ( ~/.kube/config ) --> Azure IoT Ops CLI Extension --> Kubernetes Cluster
        ```
        - Step 3: The provided code files, including files in `/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/iotopsmgmt/`, `/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/deviceregistrymgmt/` and `/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/resourcesmgmt/`, do not contain explicit code snippets that load the kubeconfig file. However, the `README.md` file clearly indicates the reliance on kubeconfig. Further investigation of the codebase (beyond the provided files) would be required to pinpoint the exact code responsible for kubeconfig loading and usage. Based on standard Kubernetes Python client library usage, it's highly probable that the extension utilizes the `kubernetes.config.load_kube_config()` function or similar mechanisms which by default look for kubeconfig in the `~/.kube/config` path. The files analyzed in this batch are mostly related to Azure client generation for resource management, device registry management and data serialization/deserialization, and do not include the core CLI extension logic where kubeconfig handling would be implemented. **Analysis of the files in this batch does not reveal any new vulnerabilities or changes to the existing vulnerability related to kubeconfig exposure.**
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup**:
        - Install the Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI in a test environment.
        - Configure the extension to manage a test Kubernetes cluster. This involves ensuring that a valid kubeconfig file for the test cluster is present at the default location: `~/.kube/config`.
        - Verify that the CLI extension can successfully interact with the test cluster using a basic command like `az iot ops check --cluster <cluster_name> -g <resource_group>`.
    2. **Simulate Kubeconfig Theft**:
        - As an attacker, simulate gaining access to the user's local filesystem. This step is a simulation of an external attack and does not involve direct interaction with the CLI extension. For testing purposes, simply assume read access to the user's home directory.
        - Copy the kubeconfig file from the default location `~/.kube/config` to a temporary attacker-controlled directory, for example `/tmp/attacker_kubeconfig`.
    3. **Attempt Unauthorized Cluster Access**:
        - Open a new terminal session, simulating the attacker's environment.
        - Using `kubectl`, attempt to access the test Kubernetes cluster, explicitly specifying the copied kubeconfig file:
            ```bash
            kubectl --kubeconfig /tmp/attacker_kubeconfig get pods --all-namespaces
            ```
        - Observe the output of the `kubectl` command.
    4. **Verification**:
        - **Successful Exploitation**: If the `kubectl` command successfully retrieves information about pods in the Kubernetes cluster (or performs other cluster operations), this confirms the vulnerability. The attacker, using the stolen kubeconfig, has gained unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster. The level of access will depend on the permissions configured within the stolen kubeconfig file, which often grants administrative privileges.
        - **Failed Exploitation**: If `kubectl` fails to connect or authenticate to the cluster using the copied kubeconfig, re-examine the test setup and ensure the kubeconfig was copied correctly and is valid. If failure persists, it might indicate that the vulnerability is not present, or the test case is not accurately simulating the exploit. However, given the strong indication from the documentation, successful exploitation is expected in a default configuration.
