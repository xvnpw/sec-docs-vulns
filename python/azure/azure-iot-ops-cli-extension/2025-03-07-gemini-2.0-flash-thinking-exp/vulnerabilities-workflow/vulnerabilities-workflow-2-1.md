- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in Resource Querying
- Description: The `build_query` function in `/code/azext_edge/edge/util/common.py` constructs Azure Resource Graph queries. If the `custom_query` parameter or other kwargs like `name`, `resource_group`, `location`, or `type` are directly derived from user input without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection. Although it's not directly executing OS commands, it's injecting into a query language that could potentially be exploited to extract more information than intended or cause unexpected behavior in the Azure Resource Graph service, which could be considered a form of command injection in a broader sense within the context of interacting with Azure services. An attacker could craft malicious input to manipulate the query logic and potentially gain access to sensitive information or enumerate resources they should not have access to.
- Impact: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information about Azure resources, enumerate resources across subscriptions, or cause unexpected behavior by manipulating the Resource Graph queries.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific sanitization or input validation is implemented in the `build_query` function for the parameters derived from kwargs or `custom_query`.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for all parameters used to construct the Resource Graph query, especially `custom_query` and kwargs like `name`, `resource_group`, `location`, and `type`. Implement parameterized queries or use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach if feasible to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into queries.
- Preconditions: The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the Azure CLI extension commands that utilize the `build_query` function, specifically the parameters that are passed to kwargs or as `custom_query`. In the context of Azure CLI extension, this might be through command arguments or configuration files that are not properly validated.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azext_edge/edge/util/common.py`
    - Function: `build_query`
    ```python
    def build_query(cmd, subscription_id: Optional[str] = None, custom_query: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs):
        url = "/providers/Microsoft.ResourceGraph/resources?api-version=2022-10-01"
        subscriptions = [subscription_id] if subscription_id else []
        payload = {"subscriptions": subscriptions, "query": "Resources ", "options": {}}

        # TODO: add more query options as they pop up
        if kwargs.get("name"):
            payload["query"] += f'| where name =~ "{kwargs.get("name")}" '
        if kwargs.get("resource_group"):
            payload["query"] += f'| where resourceGroup =~ "{kwargs.get("resource_group")}" '
        if kwargs.get("location"):
            payload["query"] += f'| where location =~ "{kwargs.get("location")}" '
        if kwargs.get("type"):
            payload["query"] += f'| where type =~ "{kwargs.get("type")}" '
        if custom_query:
            payload["query"] += custom_query
        payload["query"] += "| project id, location, name, resourceGroup, properties, tags, type, subscriptionId"
        if kwargs.get("additional_project"):
            payload["query"] += f', {kwargs.get("additional_project")}'

        return _process_raw_request(cmd, url, "POST", payload)
    ```
    - The function `build_query` constructs a Resource Graph query string by concatenating user-controlled parameters from `kwargs` and `custom_query` directly into the query string.
    - Specifically, lines like `payload["query"] += f'| where name =~ "{kwargs.get("name")}" '` directly embed the `kwargs.get("name")` value into the query string without any sanitization or validation.
    - An attacker could potentially inject malicious query syntax within the values of `name`, `resource_group`, `location`, `type`, or `custom_query` to alter the query's intended behavior. For example, injecting `";printenv;` into `name` might not execute OS commands, but could break query parsing or lead to unexpected data retrieval if ARG service is vulnerable to such injection in any way. More dangerously, by crafting a `custom_query` with malicious ARG syntax, an attacker could potentially bypass intended query constraints and extract broader datasets.
    - The `_process_raw_request` function then executes this constructed query against Azure Resource Graph.
    - **Analysis of new files**: The provided files related to Azure Resource Management client SDK (`/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/resourcesmgmt/operations/_operations.py`, `/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/resourcesmgmt/operations/__init__.py`, `/code/azext_edge/edge/vendor/clients/resourcesmgmt/operations/_patch.py`) are auto-generated and focus on API client functionalities. These files do not contain the `build_query` function or any similar query construction logic. They are primarily responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses for Azure Resource Management APIs. These files do not introduce any new vulnerabilities related to command injection in query construction, nor do they provide any mitigations for the existing vulnerability in `/code/azext_edge/edge/util/common.py`. The vulnerability remains in the `build_query` function, and the SDK files do not impact its presence or severity.

- Security Test Case:
    - Precondition: Attacker has access to Azure CLI with the IoT Ops extension installed and configured to connect to an Azure subscription. The attacker needs to identify a command in the extension that utilizes the `build_query` function and allows user-controlled input to be passed to the kwargs of this function, or as `custom_query`. Let's assume there is a command that allows filtering resources by name, and it uses `build_query` with the `name` kwarg.
    - Steps:
        1. Identify an Azure CLI command in the IoT Ops extension that uses `build_query` and takes a `--name` parameter for filtering. (Further code analysis is needed to pinpoint such a command, assuming one exists for demonstration purposes).
        2. Execute the identified Azure CLI command with a maliciously crafted `--name` parameter designed to inject ARG syntax. For example, if the command is `az iotops edge list-resources --name "test-resource\" | where type=='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'"` (this is a hypothetical example and might not be a real command). The `--name` parameter here is crafted to include `"; | where type=='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'"`.
        3. Observe the output of the command. If the injected ARG syntax is successfully processed and alters the query execution, it indicates a potential vulnerability. For instance, if the output includes resources of type 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' when it should have only listed resources matching the name "test-resource", it would confirm the injection.
        4. A more concrete test would be to attempt to use ARG functions to extract data beyond the intended scope. For example, try to use `tostring()` or similar functions within the injected query to see if error messages or internal data structures can be exposed.
        5. For example, try to inject a name like: `test-resource') | project properties | limit 1 --name 'vuln-test` and examine the output for unexpected properties data, to confirm data exfiltration beyond intended resource filtering.
