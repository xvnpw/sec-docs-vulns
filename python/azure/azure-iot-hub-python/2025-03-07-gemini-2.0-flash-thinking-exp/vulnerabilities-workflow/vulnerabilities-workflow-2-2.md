### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Credential Exposure in Memory

- Description:
  The Azure IoT Hub Service SDK for Python stores the entire connection string, including the sensitive Shared Access Key (SAK), in memory after it is parsed. This occurs when the `from_connection_string` method is used to initialize clients like `IoTHubRegistryManager`, `IoTHubConfigurationManager`, `IoTHubJobManager`, `IoTHubHttpRuntimeManager`, and `DigitalTwinClient`. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's memory space could potentially extract this connection string and use the exposed credentials to perform unauthorized actions against the Azure IoT Hub, such as managing devices, retrieving data, and sending commands.

- Impact:
  High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the Azure IoT Hub service. An attacker can:
    - Gain full control over IoT devices registered in the hub.
    - Access sensitive data transmitted to and from devices.
    - Disrupt IoT operations by disabling or misconfiguring devices.
    - Potentially pivot to other Azure resources if the compromised credentials have broader permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The SDK currently stores the full connection string in memory by design when initialized using `from_connection_string`.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secure Credential Handling:** The SDK should be refactored to avoid storing the complete connection string in memory, especially the sensitive Shared Access Key. Instead, it should ideally:
    - Store only necessary parsed components of the connection string, excluding the raw SAK if possible, or store it in a more secure, encrypted format in memory.
    - Encourage or enforce the use of more secure credential management practices, such as using environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or managed identities, and integrate with token-based authentication where possible (e.g., using `from_token_credential`).
    - Implement mechanisms to wipe credentials from memory when they are no longer needed.

- Preconditions:
  - The application must be using the Azure IoT Hub Service SDK for Python.
  - The application must initialize an SDK client (e.g., `IoTHubRegistryManager`) using the `from_connection_string` method.
  - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the memory space of the running application process. This could be achieved through various attack vectors such as memory dumping exploits, debugging access, or in compromised environments.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **ConnectionString Parsing and Storage:**
     - File: `/code/src/azure/iot/hub/connection_string.py`
     - The `ConnectionString` class parses the connection string using `_parse_connection_string()` and stores the entire input connection string in the `_strrep` attribute during initialization:
       ```python
       class ConnectionString(object):
           def __init__(self, connection_string):
               self._dict = _parse_connection_string(connection_string)
               self._strrep = connection_string # Connection string is stored here
       ```
  2. **Authentication Class Usage:**
     - File: `/code/src/azure/iot/hub/auth.py`
     - The `ConnectionStringAuthentication` class inherits from `ConnectionString` and thus also stores the full connection string.
     - File: `/code/src/azure/iot/hub/iothub_registry_manager.py` (and other manager classes like `iothub_configuration_manager.py`, `iothub_job_manager.py`, `iothub_http_runtime_manager.py`, `digital_twin_client.py`)
     - The `from_connection_string` class method initializes the client by creating a `ConnectionStringAuthentication` object, passing the connection string directly. This `ConnectionStringAuthentication` object, containing the full connection string, is stored as a member of the client class instance (e.g., `self.auth`).
       ```python
       class IoTHubRegistryManager(object):
           ...
           @classmethod
           def from_connection_string(cls, connection_string):
               return cls(connection_string=connection_string)

           def __init__(self, connection_string=None, host=None, token_credential=None):
               ...
               if connection_string is not None:
                   conn_string_auth = ConnectionStringAuthentication(connection_string) # ConnectionStringAuthentication object created, storing connection_string
                   self.auth = conn_string_auth # Stored in self.auth
                   self.protocol = protocol_client(
                       conn_string_auth, "https://" + conn_string_auth["HostName"]
                   )
                   ...
       ```
  3. **Memory Exposure:**
     - By storing `ConnectionStringAuthentication` instance as `self.auth`, the raw connection string remains accessible in the memory of the `IoTHubRegistryManager` object throughout its lifecycle. Any memory dump or inspection of the application's memory could potentially reveal this string.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Ensure you have the `azure-iot-hub` package installed.
     - Have a valid IoT Hub connection string available (replace `"YOUR_IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING"` with your actual connection string).
  2. **Code:**
     ```python
     import os
     from azure.iot.hub import IoTHubRegistryManager

     connection_string = "YOUR_IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING" # Replace with your actual connection string

     try:
         # Create IoTHubRegistryManager instance
         iothub_registry_manager = IoTHubRegistryManager.from_connection_string(connection_string)

         # Access the auth attribute and then _strrep to retrieve the stored connection string
         exposed_connection_string = iothub_registry_manager.auth._strrep

         # Print the exposed connection string
         print("Exposed Connection String:", exposed_connection_string)

     except Exception as e:
         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
     finally:
         print("Test finished")
     ```
  3. **Execution:**
     - Replace `"YOUR_IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING"` in the code with your actual IoT Hub connection string.
     - Run the Python script.
  4. **Expected Result:**
     - The script will print the IoT Hub connection string to the console, demonstrating that the connection string, including the sensitive SharedAccessKey, is stored in memory and can be accessed through the `auth._strrep` attribute of the `IoTHubRegistryManager` instance. This confirms the vulnerability.
