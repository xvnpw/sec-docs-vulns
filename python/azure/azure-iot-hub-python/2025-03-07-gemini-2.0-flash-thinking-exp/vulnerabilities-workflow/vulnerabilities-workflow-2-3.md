### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage and Handling of IoT Hub Service Connection String
- Description:
  - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's configuration or source code where the IoT Hub service connection string is stored.
  - The attacker extracts the IoT Hub service connection string.
  - The attacker uses the Azure IoT Hub Service SDK, leveraging the compromised connection string.
  - The attacker instantiates `IoTHubRegistryManager` or other manager classes using `from_connection_string()` method, authenticating with the compromised connection string.
  - The attacker then utilizes the SDK's device management functionalities, such as `create_device_with_sas()`, `delete_device()`, `get_device()`, `update_twin()`, `invoke_device_method()`, etc., to perform unauthorized operations on devices registered in the IoT Hub.
- Impact:
  - Unauthorized device management operations, including:
    - Creation of rogue devices.
    - Deletion of legitimate devices.
    - Retrieval of device connection details.
    - Modification of device configurations and twins.
    - Invocation of direct methods on devices.
  - This can lead to disruption of service, data manipulation, and potentially unauthorized access to devices and data streams.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the SDK itself. The SDK is designed to use the connection string for authentication and management.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Documentation and best practice guidelines for securely storing and handling the connection string in applications using this SDK. This should include recommendations against hardcoding connection strings, using environment variables or secure configuration management solutions, and emphasizing the principle of least privilege for access keys.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must gain access to the IoT Hub service connection string. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Accessing application configuration files.
    - Compromising the application's deployment environment.
    - Social engineering or insider threat.
    - Vulnerabilities in the application code that expose configuration details.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The `IoTHubRegistryManager.from_connection_string()` method (and similar methods in other manager classes) in `src/azure/iot/hub/iothub_registry_manager.py` directly uses the provided connection string to instantiate the SDK client.
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def from_connection_string(cls, connection_string):
        """Classmethod initializer for a Registry Manager Service client.
        Creates Registry Manager class from connection string.
        ...
        """
        return cls(connection_string=connection_string)
    ```
  - The `ConnectionStringAuthentication` class in `src/azure/iot/hub/auth.py` parses and stores the connection string.
    ```python
    class ConnectionStringAuthentication(ConnectionString, Authentication):
        """ConnectionString class that can be used with msrest to provide SasToken authentication
        ...
        """
        def __init__(self, connection_string):
            super(ConnectionStringAuthentication, self).__init__(
                connection_string
            )  # ConnectionString __init__
    ```
  - The `ConnectionString` class in `src/azure/iot/hub/connection_string.py` handles the parsing of the connection string and stores its parts.
    ```python
    class ConnectionString(object):
        """Key/value mappings for connection details.
        Uses the same syntax as dictionary
        """

        def __init__(self, connection_string):
            """Initializer for ConnectionString
            ...
            """
            self._dict = _parse_connection_string(connection_string)
            self._strrep = connection_string
    ```
  - There is no built-in mechanism in the SDK to prevent usage with a compromised connection string if an attacker obtains it. The SDK is designed to operate correctly when provided with a valid connection string, regardless of how it was obtained.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: **Precondition**: Assume an attacker has obtained a valid IoT Hub service connection string (e.g., "HostName=your_iothub.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=YOUR_IOTHUB_OWNER_KEY").
  - Step 2: **Setup**: The attacker sets up a Python environment with the Azure IoT Hub Service SDK installed (`pip install azure-iot-hub`).
  - Step 3: **Exploit**: The attacker writes a Python script using the SDK to perform unauthorized device management operations, using the compromised connection string. For example, to list devices:
    ```python
    from azure.iot.hub import IoTHubRegistryManager

    connection_string = "YOUR_COMPROMISED_CONNECTION_STRING"  # Replace with the actual connection string

    try:
        iothub_registry_manager = IoTHubRegistryManager.from_connection_string(connection_string)
        devices = iothub_registry_manager.get_devices(10)  # List first 10 devices
        if devices:
            print("Devices found:")
            for device in devices:
                print(f"  Device ID: {device.device_id}")
        else:
            print("No devices found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```
  - Step 4: **Verification**: Run the Python script. The script successfully connects to the IoT Hub using the compromised connection string and lists devices, demonstrating unauthorized access and control. The attacker can further modify the script to perform other management operations.
