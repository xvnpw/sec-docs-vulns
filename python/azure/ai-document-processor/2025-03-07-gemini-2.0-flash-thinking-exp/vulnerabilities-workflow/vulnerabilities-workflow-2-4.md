- Vulnerability Name: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in DOCX Processing
- Description:
    - An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted DOCX file to the application.
    - The `processUploads` Azure Function is triggered to process files from the 'bronze' blob container, including the uploaded DOCX file.
    - The function uses the `python-docx` library to parse the DOCX file and extract text content.
    - If the `python-docx` library or its underlying XML parsing mechanism is vulnerable to XXE and the DOCX file contains a malicious XXE payload, the server could be exploited.
    - This could allow the attacker to read local files on the server, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or potentially other attacks depending on the server's configuration and the capabilities of the XML parser.
- Impact:
    - High: Successful XXE exploitation could allow an attacker to:
        - Read sensitive local files from the Function App's server environment, such as configuration files, environment variables (potentially containing secrets), or application code.
        - Initiate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, enabling them to interact with internal network resources or external systems from the compromised Function App, potentially leading to further lateral movement or information disclosure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The provided code does not include any explicit mitigations against XXE vulnerabilities when processing DOCX files. The `processUploads/__init__.py` function directly uses the `python-docx` library to parse DOCX files without any sanitization or security configurations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - XXE Prevention Measures: Implement robust XXE prevention measures when parsing DOCX files. This can be achieved by:
        - Configuring the underlying XML parser (likely `lxml` used by `python-docx`) to disable external entity resolution. This prevents the parser from fetching external entities defined in the DOCX XML content, which is the core mechanism of XXE attacks.
        - Consider using secure XML parsing practices and libraries that are less susceptible to XXE vulnerabilities, or ensure that the XML parser is configured with security in mind.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization:
        - While the application checks for file extensions (`.docx`, `.pdf`), it lacks content-based validation to detect and reject potentially malicious DOCX files containing XXE payloads.
        - Implement deeper content inspection and sanitization of uploaded DOCX files before parsing them to remove or neutralize any potential XXE payloads.
- Preconditions:
    - Application Deployment: The AI Document Processor application must be successfully deployed to Azure and accessible to potential attackers.
    - DOCX Upload Functionality: The application must allow users to upload DOCX files to the 'bronze' blob container, which is the intended workflow for document processing.
    - Vulnerable Library or Configuration: The `python-docx` library or its default XML parsing configuration must be susceptible to XXE attacks. While `python-docx` itself might not be directly vulnerable by default, its underlying XML processing dependencies (like `lxml`) could be if not configured securely.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/processUploads/__init__.py`
    - Function: `extract_text_from_docx(blob_name)`
    - Vulnerable Line: `doc = Document(io.BytesIO(content))`
    - Analysis:
        - The `extract_text_from_docx` function in `/code/processUploads/__init__.py` is responsible for parsing DOCX files.
        - It retrieves the DOCX file content from Azure Blob Storage using `get_blob_content`.
        - The line `doc = Document(io.BytesIO(content))` instantiates a `Document` object from the `python-docx` library, parsing the DOCX file content.
        - If the `python-docx` library, or more likely the underlying XML parser it utilizes (e.g., `lxml`), is not configured to prevent XXE attacks, processing a maliciously crafted DOCX file at this point could trigger an XXE vulnerability.
        - The code does not include any steps to sanitize or validate the DOCX content for XXE payloads before parsing.

    ```
    File: /code/processUploads/__init__.py
    function code:
    def extract_text_from_docx(blob_name):
        try:
            # Get the content of the blob
            content = get_blob_content("bronze", blob_name)
            # Load the content into a Document object
            doc = Document(io.BytesIO(content)) # Vulnerable line
            # Extract and print the text
            full_text = []
            for paragraph in doc.paragraphs:
                full_text.append(paragraph.text)

            # Combine paragraphs into a single string
            text = "\n".join(full_text)
            return text
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error processing {blob_name}: {e}")
            return None
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare Malicious DOCX File:
        - Create a DOCX file containing an XXE payload. This payload will attempt to read a sensitive file from the server's filesystem, such as `/etc/passwd` on a Linux-based system, or attempt to trigger an error that can reveal if external entity processing is happening. A sample XXE payload embedded within the DOCX XML structure might look like:

        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE doc [
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <doc>&xxe;</doc>
        ```
        (Note: This is a simplified XML example and needs to be correctly embedded within the various XML parts of a valid DOCX file, such as within `word/document.xml` or similar, and zipped into a `.docx` container.)
    2. Upload the Malicious DOCX File:
        - Using the application's frontend, upload the crafted DOCX file. Ensure it is uploaded to the 'bronze' blob container, as this is the container processed by the `processUploads` function.
    3. Trigger Document Processing:
        - Initiate the document processing workflow. This might involve using the application's frontend to select the uploaded DOCX file and trigger the processing, or by directly invoking the `processUploads` Azure Function if possible. You may need to call the relevant API endpoint that triggers the `processUploads` function.
    4. Monitor Function App Logs:
        - Access and examine the logs of the Azure Function App. Look for any of the following indicators in the logs:
            - Error messages related to file access or XML parsing that could indicate XXE exploitation. For example, errors suggesting attempts to access `/etc/passwd` or similar system files.
            - Unexpected behavior or exceptions during DOCX processing.
            - If the XXE payload is designed to cause an error by trying to include a non-XML file, error messages from the XML parser might confirm that external entity processing is attempted.
        - If successful in reading `/etc/passwd` (though less likely to directly output in logs), you might not see direct content, but errors related to XML parsing after entity replacement could be a sign. For more reliable testing, an out-of-band XXE using an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server would be more effective, but file reading is simpler to test initially.
    5. Analyze Network Traffic (Optional but Recommended for SSRF XXE):
        - If you modify the XXE payload to perform an SSRF attack (e.g., make an HTTP request to an external server you control), monitor network traffic from the Function App. Successful SSRF XXE will show an outbound HTTP request from the Function App to your server when the malicious DOCX is processed.
    6. Verify Exploitation:
        - Based on the logs and/or network traffic, determine if the XXE attack was successful. Evidence of successful exploitation includes:
            - Log entries indicating file access attempts to sensitive files.
            - Outbound network connections to attacker-controlled servers (for SSRF payloads).
            - Error messages from the XML parser indicating processing of external entities.

This test case aims to demonstrate the potential XXE vulnerability by attempting to read a system file. A more sophisticated test case could involve setting up a listener on an external server and crafting an XXE payload to perform an out-of-band SSRF to confirm the vulnerability more definitively.
