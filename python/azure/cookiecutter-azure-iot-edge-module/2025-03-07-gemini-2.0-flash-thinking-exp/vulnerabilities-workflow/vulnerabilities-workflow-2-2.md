## Vulnerability List

### Command Injection

**Description:** An attacker could exploit command injection vulnerabilities in a Python Azure IoT Edge module generated using this template if the module processes unsanitized input from IoT Hub messages and uses it in system commands.
Step by step how someone can trigger vulnerability:
1. A developer uses this cookiecutter template to create an Azure IoT Edge Python module.
2. The developer implements logic in the module to receive messages from Azure IoT Hub.
3. Within this logic, the developer processes data from the IoT Hub message, for example, taking a string value from the message payload.
4. The developer unsafely uses this string value as part of a system command executed using libraries like `os.system`, `subprocess.Popen`, etc. without proper sanitization or validation.
5. An attacker sends a crafted message to the IoT Hub that will be processed by the module. This message contains malicious commands within the part of the payload that is used in the system command.
6. When the module processes this message, the malicious commands are executed on the IoT Edge device's operating system, leading to command injection.

**Impact:** Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the IoT Edge device. This can lead to:
- Full compromise of the IoT Edge device.
- Data exfiltration from the device.
- Modification of device configuration.
- Use of the device as a bot in a botnet.
- Lateral movement to other systems in the network.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** No mitigations are implemented in the template itself to prevent command injection in modules created using it. The template provides a basic structure but does not enforce secure coding practices for handling input.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- The template should include guidance and warnings in the generated module code and documentation about the risks of command injection and the importance of input sanitization when processing external data, especially if used in system commands.
- Consider adding code examples or helper functions within the template to demonstrate safe input handling and command execution practices (e.g., using parameterized commands or escaping shell metacharacters).
- Static analysis or security linters could be recommended in the documentation to help developers detect potential command injection vulnerabilities in their modules.

**Preconditions:**
- A developer must use the cookiecutter template to generate an Azure IoT Edge Python module.
- The developer must implement custom logic in the module that:
    - Receives and processes messages from Azure IoT Hub.
    - Uses data from these messages in system commands.
    - Fails to properly sanitize or validate the input data before using it in system commands.
- The IoT Edge module must be deployed and running on an IoT Edge device.
- The attacker must be able to send messages to the IoT Hub that are processed by the vulnerable module.

**Source Code Analysis:**
The cookiecutter template itself (`cookiecutter.json` and template files) does not contain any code that directly executes system commands or processes external input in a vulnerable way. The vulnerability is not in the template code itself, but arises from how developers *might use* the generated template and *add their own code*.
The generated `main.py` provides a basic message handling structure, but it does not inherently contain command injection vulnerabilities.
```python
# Example from generated main.py (illustrative, may vary slightly)
class InputQueueConsumer(Consumer):
    async def process_message(self, message: Message):
        print("Received message on input queue, processing...", flush=True)
        message_body = message.get_body().decode()
        print(f"Message body: {message_body}", flush=True)
        # Potential vulnerable area would be if developer adds code here to:
        # 1. Extract data from message_body (e.g., message_body.get("command"))
        # 2. Use that data in a system command, e.g., os.system(f"do_something {extracted_command}")
        await self.output_queue.publish_message(message)
        await message.complete()
```
The vulnerability is introduced when developers extend this basic structure and *unsafely* use message content in system commands. The template does not prevent this, nor does it provide explicit guidance to avoid it beyond general security best practices that developers should ideally be aware of.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Deploy an Azure IoT Edge module generated by the cookiecutter template to an IoT Edge device.
2. Modify the `main.py` of the generated module to introduce a command injection vulnerability. For example, within the `process_message` function, add code that extracts a value from the message body and uses it in `os.system` without sanitization.
   ```python
   import os
   import json

   async def process_message(self, message: Message):
       message_body_str = message.get_body().decode()
       message_body = json.loads(message_body_str)
       command_to_execute = message_body.get("command") # Get command from message
       if command_to_execute:
           os.system(command_to_execute) # Vulnerable command execution
       await self.output_queue.publish_message(message)
       await message.complete()
   ```
3. Build and deploy the modified module to the IoT Edge device.
4. Use Azure IoT Hub explorer or similar tool to send a message to the IoT Edge device's module input queue. Craft a message payload that contains a malicious command in the "command" field. For example:
   ```json
   {
       "command": "ping -c 3 attacker.example.com"
   }
   ```
5. Observe the logs of the IoT Edge module. If the command injection is successful, you should see evidence of the `ping` command being executed (e.g., network traffic to `attacker.example.com` or log messages if you log the command output).
6. For a more impactful test, use a command like `touch /tmp/pwned` in the message payload and then check on the IoT Edge device if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created.

This test case demonstrates that by adding vulnerable code to a module generated by the template, command injection is possible.  The template itself doesn't *have* the vulnerability, but it facilitates the creation of modules that *can* be vulnerable if developers introduce such flaws.
