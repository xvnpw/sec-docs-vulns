### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in Modules Generated by Template
* Description:
    1. Developers use this cookiecutter template to generate a base Python module for Azure IoT Edge.
    2. The generated module provides a basic structure for receiving and processing messages.
    3. Developers are expected to add their own logic to the `main.py` file to handle messages and perform specific actions based on the requirements of their IoT Edge module.
    4. If developers naively process external input from messages (e.g., message data, message properties, or cloud commands) and use this input in system commands or shell executions without proper sanitization, they can introduce command injection vulnerabilities in their module.
    5. An attacker could then send crafted messages or commands to the IoT Edge module to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the module's process on the IoT Edge device.
* Impact:
    - If a command injection vulnerability is introduced in a module generated by this template, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the IoT Edge device where the module is deployed.
    - This could lead to a full compromise of the IoT Edge device, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, denial of service, lateral movement within the network, or use of the device for malicious purposes like botnet participation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The template itself provides a basic structure for an IoT Edge module but does not include any security mitigations against command injection or other vulnerabilities that developers might introduce in their module logic.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Documentation Warning:** The template documentation (e.g., README.md) should include a prominent warning about the risk of command injection vulnerabilities if external input is processed without proper sanitization. This warning should emphasize that developers are responsible for securing their module logic and sanitizing any external input before using it in system commands or shell executions.
    - **Secure Coding Guidance:** The documentation should provide guidance on secure coding practices to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. This guidance should include:
        - **Input Sanitization:**  Explain the importance of sanitizing and validating all external input received by the module before using it in any system commands.
        - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Recommend running the module with the least privileges necessary to perform its intended tasks to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.
        - **Avoid Shell=True:**  Advise against using `shell=True` in `subprocess` calls and recommend using parameterized commands or alternative safer methods for executing external commands when possible.
        - **Example of Safe Input Handling:**  Consider including a simple code example in the documentation or as a comment in the `main.py` template that demonstrates how to safely handle external input and avoid command injection.
* Preconditions:
    - A developer must use this cookiecutter template to generate an IoT Edge module.
    - The developer must modify the generated module code (typically `main.py`) to process external input from IoT Hub messages, device twin properties, module twin desired properties, or cloud-to-module commands.
    - The developer must naively use this external input in system commands or shell executions without implementing proper input sanitization or validation.
    - The vulnerable module must be deployed to an IoT Edge device.
    - An attacker must be able to send messages, update twin properties, or send cloud commands to the deployed IoT Edge module.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - **Template Code (`{{cookiecutter.module_name}}/main.py`):** The provided `main.py` template itself is safe and does not contain any command injection vulnerabilities. It focuses on setting up an IoT Hub module client and forwarding messages.
    - **Vulnerable Code Example (Illustrative - Not in Template):**  The vulnerability arises when developers modify the `receive_message_handler` or add other input processing logic in the module and naively use external input in system commands. For example, if a developer modifies `main.py` to execute a command based on the message data like this:

    ```python
    import subprocess
    import asyncio
    from azure.iot.device.aio import IoTHubModuleClient

    client = IoTHubModuleClient.create_from_edge_environment()

    async def receive_message_handler(message):
        if message.input_name == "input1":
            user_input = message.data.decode() # Assume message.data contains user-controlled string
            command = "echo " + user_input  # Vulnerable command construction
            try:
                process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
                stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
                print(stdout.decode())
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error executing command: {e}")
            await client.send_message_to_output(message, "output1")

    client.on_message_received = receive_message_handler
    async def main():
        await asyncio.sleep(3600) # Keep module running

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    [Attacker] --(Crafted Message with Malicious Payload)--> [IoT Hub] --(Message)--> [IoT Edge Module (Vulnerable main.py)]
                                                                  |
                                                                  V
                  [Vulnerable Code in main.py: subprocess.Popen(shell=True, command)] --> [System Shell] --(Command Injection Exploit)--> [IoT Edge Device Compromised]
    ```

    - In this vulnerable example, if an attacker sends a message to `input1` with `message.data` set to  `; touch /tmp/pwned #`, the `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` will execute this as a shell command, resulting in the creation of `/tmp/pwned` file on the IoT Edge device. This demonstrates command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Set up an Azure IoT Edge environment (either simulated or on a physical device) and have the necessary tools to build and deploy IoT Edge modules (e.g., Docker, Azure CLI, IoT Edge extension for VS Code).
    2. **Generate Module:** Use the cookiecutter template to generate a new IoT Edge module using the command: `cookiecutter --no-input https://github.com/Azure/cookiecutter-azure-iot-edge-module module_name=vulnmodule image_repository=localhost:5000/vulnmodule --checkout master`
    3. **Modify `main.py` for Vulnerability:**  Navigate to the `vulnmodule/main.py` file and modify the `receive_message_handler` function to introduce a command injection vulnerability. Replace the existing `receive_message_handler` with the vulnerable code example shown in the Source Code Analysis section above. Ensure the `command` variable is constructed by directly concatenating user input from `message.data` into an `echo` command and executed using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, ...)`.
    4. **Build and Push Module:** Build the Docker image for the modified module and push it to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or a local registry).  Use `docker build -t localhost:5000/vulnmodule:0.0.1 ./vulnmodule` and `docker push localhost:5000/vulnmodule:0.0.1`.
    5. **Deploy Module to IoT Edge:** Create an IoT Edge deployment manifest that includes the `vulnmodule`. Deploy this manifest to your IoT Edge device.
    6. **Send Malicious Message:** Use the Azure IoT Hub explorer or any suitable tool to send a message to the `vulnmodule`'s `input1`. Set the message body (data) to a command injection payload, for example: `; touch /tmp/pwned #`. Ensure the message is sent to the `input1` input of the `vulnmodule` module deployed on your IoT Edge device.
    7. **Verify Command Injection:** Access the IoT Edge device (e.g., via SSH if it's a physical device or by executing commands within the container if using a simulated environment). Check if the command injection was successful by verifying if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the device's filesystem. If the file exists, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is exploitable.
    8. **Cleanup:** Remove the deployed module and the created Docker image if needed.
