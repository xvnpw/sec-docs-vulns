- Vulnerability Name: Cypher Injection via Malicious Stormcollector Output File

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Stormcollector output file (either a ZIP archive containing SQLite databases or a JSON file, although JSON is not the intended format for Stormspotter parsing according to the README).
    2. This malicious file contains specially crafted data within resource properties (e.g., resource IDs, names, tags, or any other string fields that are processed and inserted into Neo4j).
    3. The attacker uploads this malicious file through the Stormspotter UI using the file upload functionality in the Database View tab.
    4. The Stormspotter backend receives the uploaded file and extracts data from it.
    5. The backend parses the extracted data and constructs Cypher queries to insert nodes and relationships into the Neo4j database.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization of input data, the crafted malicious data is directly embedded into Cypher queries as string literals.
    7. When these Cypher queries are executed against the Neo4j database, the injected malicious Cypher code is also executed, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate the database, extract sensitive information, or cause application malfunction.

- Impact:
    - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete existing data in the Neo4j database, leading to a corrupted or misrepresented attack graph. This could mislead security analysts and red teams relying on Stormspotter for Azure security visualization.
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to extract sensitive data from the Neo4j database by injecting Cypher queries designed to exfiltrate information.
    - **Application Instability:** Malicious Cypher code could potentially cause unexpected application behavior, errors, or even crashes in the backend, affecting the availability and reliability of Stormspotter.
    - **Potential for further exploitation:** In a more severe scenario, depending on Neo4j configurations and permissions, successful Cypher injection could potentially be leveraged for more significant system compromise, though this is less likely in the described application context.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `backend/backend/db.py` file includes a `sanitize_string` function, which attempts to sanitize string inputs by replacing backslashes (`\`) with double backslashes (`\\`) and removing single quotes (`'`). This function is intended to prevent Cypher injection by escaping special characters that could be used to break out of string literals in Cypher queries.
    - The `sanitize_string` function is called within the `generate_set_statement` method in `backend/backend/db.py`, which is used to create the `SET` clause of Cypher `MERGE` statements for node properties.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Insufficient Sanitization:** The current `sanitize_string` function is not robust enough to prevent Cypher injection. Removing single quotes and escaping backslashes is a basic attempt, but it may not cover all injection vectors or bypass more sophisticated injection techniques. More comprehensive input sanitization or parameterized queries should be used.
    - **Lack of Parameterized Queries:** The code uses string formatting to construct Cypher queries in `backend/backend/db.py`. This is inherently vulnerable to injection attacks. Parameterized queries should be implemented to separate data from the Cypher query structure, preventing malicious data from being interpreted as code.
    - **Input Validation:** The backend should implement more rigorous input validation on the uploaded Stormcollector output files. This includes:
        - **File Format Validation:** Strictly enforce the expected file format (SQLite databases within ZIP archives) and reject any files that do not conform. While JSON conversion is mentioned in README for other purposes, Stormspotter parser should strictly parse SQLite format.
        - **Data Schema Validation:** Validate the schema and data types within the SQLite databases to ensure they match the expected Stormcollector output format. Reject files with unexpected schemas or data types.
        - **Content Sanitization:** Even with format and schema validation, further sanitization of string content is necessary to prevent injection.  A more robust sanitization function should be implemented or ideally, parameterized queries should be used.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs access to the Stormspotter UI, which is exposed by default on port 9091.
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Stormcollector output file. This requires understanding the expected data structure of Stormcollector output (SQLite databases).
    - The Stormspotter backend must be configured to process uploaded files and connect to a Neo4j database.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File Upload Endpoint:** In `backend/backend/main.py`, the `/api/upload` endpoint receives the uploaded file and calls `sshandler.process`:
    ```python
    @app.post("/api/upload")
    async def process_upload(
        task: BackgroundTasks,
        x_neo4j_user: str = Header("neo4j"),
        x_neo4j_pass: str = Header("password"),
        upload: UploadFile = File(...),
    ):
        upload.file.rollover()
        task.add_task(
            sshandler.process,
            upload.file._file,
            upload.filename,
            x_neo4j_user,
            x_neo4j_pass,
        )
        return {"status": "Upload Success"}
    ```
    2. **SSProcessor.process:** In `backend/backend/parser.py`, the `SSProcessor.process` method handles the uploaded file. It checks for ZIP files, extracts them, and then processes SQLite files using `process_sqlite`:
    ```python
    async def process(
        self, upload: SpooledTemporaryFile, filename: str, neo_user: str, neo_pass: str
    ):
        # ...
        if zipfile.is_zipfile(upload):
            # ...
            zipfile.ZipFile(upload).extractall(tempdir)
            sqlite_files = [
                f for f in Path(tempdir).glob("*") if await self.is_sqlite(f)
            ]
            await asyncio.gather(*[self.process_sqlite(s) for s in sqlite_files])
            # ...
    ```
    3. **SSProcessor.process_sqlite:** This method reads data from SQLite databases and calls `_process_json` for each row:
    ```python
    async def process_sqlite(self, sql_file: Path):
        # ...
        async with aiosqlite.connect(sql_file) as db:
            async with db.execute("SELECT * from results") as cursor:
                while row := await cursor.fetchone():
                    await self._process_json(row[1])
        # ...
    ```
    4. **SSProcessor._process_json:** This method parses JSON data and calls specific parsing methods based on the `type` or `objectType` field, eventually leading to database insertion using methods in the `Neo4j` class (e.g., `_parseAADUser`, `_parseDisk`, etc.). For example, inside `_parseAADUser`:
    ```python
    async def _parseAADUser(self, user: dict):
        parsed = await self._parseObject(user, user.keys(), AADUSER_NODE_LABEL)
        post_user = await self._postProcessResource(parsed)
        self.neo.insert_asset(
            post_user, AADOBJECT_NODE_LABEL, post_user["objectId"], [AADUSER_NODE_LABEL]
        )
    ```
    5. **Neo4j.insert_asset and Neo4j.create_relationship:** In `backend/backend/db.py`, these methods construct Cypher queries using string formatting. Critically, `sanitize_string` is used in `generate_set_statement`, but it might be insufficient. Let's examine `generate_set_statement`:
    ```python
    def generate_set_statement(self, asset, extra_labels=None):
        """ parses resource for type and creates appropriate index via id"""

        def f(x):
            return (
                f"'{self.sanitize_string(x)}'" if (isinstance(x, str) or not x) else x
            )

        set_statements_parts = [
            f"obj.{key} = {f(value)}" for key, value in asset.items() if not key == "id"
        ]
        if extra_labels:
            set_statements_parts.extend([f"obj :{value}" for value in extra_labels])
        return ", ".join(set_statements_parts)
    ```
    The function `f(x)` calls `sanitize_string(x)` if the value is a string. However, this sanitization is very basic and might be bypassed. The formatted string is then directly used within the Cypher query without parameterization, making it vulnerable to injection if `sanitize_string` is bypassed.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious SQLite Database:**
        - Create a valid Stormcollector SQLite output database (you can generate a normal output using Stormcollector and then modify it).
        - In the `results` table, find a JSON entry (the `result` column).
        - Modify a string field within this JSON entry (e.g., a resource `name` or `id`) to include malicious Cypher code. For example, if you are modifying the `name` field of a resource, you could change it to:
          ```json
          {
            "name": "MaliciousName' }; CREATE (p:Pwned {value:'Injected'}); --",
            ... (rest of the resource properties) ...
          }
          ```
          This payload attempts to create a new node with label `Pwned`.
        - Save the modified JSON back into the SQLite database, replacing the original entry.
        - Zip the modified SQLite database.

    2. **Upload the Malicious ZIP File:**
        - Start Stormspotter and access the UI in a browser (usually http://localhost:9091).
        - Go to the "Database" tab.
        - Use the "Stormcollector Upload" section to upload the malicious ZIP file you created.
        - Monitor the backend logs (if accessible) or the Neo4j database directly.

    3. **Verify Cypher Injection:**
        - **Check Neo4j Database:** After the upload is processed, connect to the Neo4j database (usually via http://localhost:7474 with credentials neo4j/password).
        - Execute a Cypher query to check for the injected node (if you used the safer payload): `MATCH (n:Pwned) RETURN n`.
        - If the query returns a node with label `Pwned` and property `value: 'Injected'`, then the Cypher injection was successful.
        - If you used the destructive payload (database deletion - **not recommended for live testing**), check if the Neo4j database is corrupted or deleted.

    4. **Observe Backend Logs:** Examine the backend logs for any errors or unexpected Cypher queries being executed. This might provide further evidence of successful injection even if direct database access is limited.

This security test case will demonstrate whether an attacker can successfully inject Cypher code through a manipulated Stormcollector output file, confirming the Cypher Injection vulnerability.
