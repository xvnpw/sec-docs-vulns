### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Image Download from Bing Image Search (Data Poisoning)
* Description:
    1. The `data_ingestion.py` script fetches images from Bing Image Search based on predefined classes (e.g., airplane, automobile).
    2. For each class, it iterates through search results and downloads images directly from the URLs provided by Bing Image Search API.
    3. The script downloads images without any validation of the image content or source.
    4. An attacker can perform a data poisoning attack by manipulating image search results on Bing for the targeted classes.
    5. This manipulation can be achieved through various SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and web content manipulation techniques to associate malicious or misleading images with the keywords used for image search (e.g., 'airplane', 'automobile').
    6. When the `data_ingestion.py` script runs, it will unknowingly download these manipulated images and include them in the training dataset.
    7. Consequently, the trained object classification model will be poisoned, leading to reduced accuracy, biased predictions, or misclassification of objects, depending on the nature and extent of the injected malicious data.
* Impact:
    - Compromised model accuracy: The object classification model's accuracy will be significantly reduced as it is trained on a dataset containing poisoned images.
    - Misclassification of objects: The model may start misclassifying objects, leading to incorrect predictions in real-world applications.
    - Biased predictions: The model's predictions can become biased towards the injected malicious data, causing systematic errors in object classification.
    - Reduced reliability: The overall reliability of the object classification pipeline is undermined, as the model's output can no longer be trusted due to data poisoning.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no mitigations implemented in the project to validate or sanitize images downloaded from Bing Image Search. The script directly downloads and saves images based on URLs provided by the API without any checks.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Image Validation:** Implement image validation techniques to verify the integrity and safety of downloaded images. This could include:
        - **Content-based validation:** Analyze image content to detect anomalies, malicious patterns, or deviations from expected image characteristics for each class.
        - **Source-based validation:** Implement checks on the image source URL to ensure it originates from reputable and trusted domains.
        - **Heuristic-based validation:** Use heuristics or pre-trained models to identify potentially malicious or irrelevant images based on visual features.
        - **Human-in-the-loop validation:** Incorporate a manual review step where a human expert validates a subset of downloaded images to identify and remove suspicious entries.
    - **Input Sanitization:** While direct sanitization of images might be complex, sanitizing the input queries to Bing Image Search could be beneficial. However, this project uses predefined class names, limiting the scope for input sanitization in this context.
    - **Data Auditing and Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to audit the downloaded dataset and monitor model performance for anomalies after training. This can help detect data poisoning post-training and trigger retraining or corrective actions.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate Bing Image Search results for the keywords used by the `data_ingestion.py` script (i.e., 'airplane', 'automobile', etc.).
    - The Azure Machine Learning pipeline must be executed, and the data ingestion step must be reached.
    - The pipeline must have access to the internet to query the Bing Image Search API and download images.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/modules/ingestion/data_ingestion.py`
    ```python
    for image in results:
        if counter > num_images:
            break
        if image['encodingFormat'] == 'jpeg':
            print('Writing image {} for {}...'.format(counter, name))
            filename = '{}/{}.jpg'.format(dir_name, counter)
            try:
                with time_limit(5):
                    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
                        download = requests.get(image['contentUrl'], headers=headers) # Vulnerable line: Direct download from URL
                        file.write(download.content)
                    counter += 1
            except:
                print('Skipping {} due to download error:'.format(filename))
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The line `download = requests.get(image['contentUrl'], headers=headers)` in the `data_ingestion.py` script is the core vulnerability. It directly fetches the image content from the `contentUrl` provided by the Bing Image Search API response without any validation.
    - **Attack Vector:** An attacker who can influence Bing Image Search results to return URLs pointing to malicious images will cause the `data_ingestion.py` script to download and include these images in the dataset.
    - **No Validation:** There is no code in `data_ingestion.py` or related modules that validates the downloaded image content, checks the image source, or performs any sanitization. The script assumes that all URLs returned by Bing Image Search are safe and lead to valid, benign images.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the Azure Machine Learning pipeline as described in the README.md.
        - Identify the endpoint URL of the deployed object classification service using `test-endpoint.py` after a successful pipeline run with a clean dataset.
        - Establish a baseline accuracy for the model using the `test-endpoint.py` script with legitimate test images for each class.
    2. **Data Poisoning Attack Simulation:**
        - **Identify Target Class:** Choose a target class for poisoning, e.g., "airplane".
        - **Prepare Poisoned Images:** Create or find a set of images that are malicious or misleading but might be loosely related to the target class (e.g., images of birds mislabeled as airplanes, or images containing malware disguised as airplane pictures).
        - **Manipulate Search Results (Simulated):** Since directly manipulating Bing Search results is generally not feasible for an external attacker, simulate this step. Instead of actually changing Bing's index, manually modify the `data_ingestion.py` script to inject URLs of your prepared poisoned images into the `results` variable *before* the download loop. This simulates a scenario where Bing Search results are compromised.  Alternatively, you could try to influence Bing Search results through SEO techniques for test purposes if feasible, but this is complex and time-consuming.
        - **Run Modified Pipeline:** Execute the modified `object-classification-pipeline.py` script. This will run the data ingestion step with the injected poisoned images. The pipeline will proceed through preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment using the poisoned dataset.
    3. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - **Test Endpoint with Clean Images:** After the pipeline run with poisoned data completes and the model is redeployed, use the `test-endpoint.py` script with the *same legitimate test images* used to establish the baseline accuracy.
        - **Observe Accuracy Degradation:** Compare the accuracy of the model trained with poisoned data to the baseline accuracy. A significant decrease in accuracy, especially for the targeted class ("airplane" in this example), will indicate successful data poisoning.
        - **Observe Misclassification:** Test the endpoint with images from the poisoned class and observe if the model misclassifies them or shows biased predictions, indicating that the poisoning has affected the model's behavior.

By following these steps, you can demonstrate that the lack of image validation in the data ingestion process allows for data poisoning attacks, leading to a compromised object classification model.
