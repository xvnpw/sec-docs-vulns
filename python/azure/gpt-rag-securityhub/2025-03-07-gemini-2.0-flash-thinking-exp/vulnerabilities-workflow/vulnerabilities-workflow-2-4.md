### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Audit Logs

- Description:
    - An attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload into the `question`, `answer`, or `sources` parameters of the `/Audit` API endpoint.
    - This payload is then stored unsanitized in the Cosmos DB audit logs through the `audit_to_db` function in `auditing/audit.py`.
    - If an administrator or user accesses a web interface that displays these audit logs without proper output sanitization, the malicious JavaScript payload will be executed in their browser.
    - This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, user credentials, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the web interface.

- Impact:
    - Account Takeover: An attacker could potentially steal administrator or user session cookies, leading to account takeover.
    - Data Breach: If the web interface displays sensitive security data, an attacker could use XSS to exfiltrate this data.
    - Malicious Actions: An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, such as modifying security configurations or injecting false security alerts within the web interface.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Content safety checks are implemented for questions and answers via Azure Content Safety service in `safety_checks` and `check_execution.py`. These checks include `promptShield`, `jailbreak_detection`, and `analyze_text` for questions, and `groundedness_check`, `protected_material_detection`, `analyze_text`, and `promptShield` for answers and sources.
    - These checks are intended to detect and potentially block or flag malicious content before it is processed or logged.
    - However, the security checks are not explicitly used to sanitize the output before logging to the database. The raw, potentially malicious input, along with the results of the security checks, are both logged. If the web interface displays the raw input from the logs, the XSS vulnerability remains.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output Sanitization: Implement output sanitization (encoding or escaping) of the `question`, `answer`, and `sources` data before logging them to Cosmos DB in `auditing/audit.py`. This would prevent the browser from interpreting injected scripts as executable code when the logs are displayed in a web interface.
    - Contextual Output Encoding: Apply contextual output encoding based on where the data is displayed in the web interface (e.g., HTML encoding for display in HTML, JavaScript encoding for display in JavaScript).
    - Input Validation: While safety checks are performed, explicit input validation on the `/Audit` endpoint to reject requests containing potentially malicious characters or patterns could add an additional layer of defense.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/Audit` API endpoint. This endpoint is likely intended for internal use or authorized clients, but if accessible externally without proper authentication or authorization, it becomes a vulnerability.
    - There must be a web interface that displays the audit logs stored in Cosmos DB. This web interface must not properly sanitize the data before displaying it.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/function_app.py`
        ```python
        @app.route(route="Audit")
        async def audit(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
            try:
                req_body = req.get_json()
                question = req_body.get('question')
                answer = req_body.get('answer')
                sources = req_body.get('sources')
                security_checks = req_body.get('security_checks')
                conversation_id = req_body.get('conversation_id')
            except ValueError:
                return func.HttpResponse("Invalid request", status_code=400)
            try:
                await auditing.audit_to_db(conversation_id, question, answer, sources, security_checks)
            except Exception as e:
                return func.HttpResponse(f"Error auditing to db: {e}", status_code=400)
            return func.HttpResponse("Logging updated", status_code=200)
        ```
        - The `/Audit` endpoint in `function_app.py` receives `question`, `answer`, and `sources` from the request body (`req_body`).
        - These values are directly passed to the `auditing.audit_to_db` function without any sanitization.

    - File: `/code/auditing/audit.py`
        ```python
        async def audit_to_db(conversation_id, question, answer, sources, security_checks):
            # ... (Cosmos DB connection code) ...
            interaction = {
                "time": datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
                'question': question,
                'answer': answer,
                'sources': sources,
                "security_checks": security_checks
            }
            conversation_data['interactions'].append(interaction)
            conversation['conversation_data'] = conversation_data
            # ... (Cosmos DB update code) ...
            return
        ```
        - The `audit_to_db` function in `auditing/audit.py` creates an `interaction` dictionary that includes `question`, `answer`, and `sources` directly from the parameters passed to the function.
        - This `interaction` dictionary is then stored in Cosmos DB as part of the audit logs without any sanitization or encoding.
        - **Visualization:**
        ```
        [function_app.py - /Audit endpoint] --> [auditing/audit.py - audit_to_db] --> [Cosmos DB]
        (Receives question, answer, sources)        (Logs data to Cosmos DB without sanitization)   (Data stored unsanitized)
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the Security Hub function app and ensure the `/Audit` endpoint is accessible (at least for testing purposes). Assume you have access to a hypothetical web interface that displays the Cosmos DB audit logs.
    2. **Craft XSS Payload:** Create a malicious JavaScript payload, for example: `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">`.
    3. **Send Malicious Request:** Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to the `/Audit` endpoint with the XSS payload in the `question` parameter.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"conversation_id": "test-conversation", "question": "<img src=x onerror=\"alert(\'XSS Vulnerability\')\">", "answer": "test answer", "sources": "test sources", "security_checks": {"test_check": "passed"}}' <FUNCTION_APP_AUDIT_ENDPOINT>
        ```
        Replace `<FUNCTION_APP_AUDIT_ENDPOINT>` with the actual URL of your deployed `/Audit` endpoint.
    4. **Verify Payload in Cosmos DB:** Access the Cosmos DB instance and navigate to the `security_logs` container. Find the entry corresponding to the `conversation_id` "test-conversation". Verify that the `question` field in the `interactions` array contains the raw XSS payload `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">` without sanitization.
    5. **Simulate Web Interface Display:**  Imagine or, ideally, set up a simple HTML page that fetches and displays the `question` field from the Cosmos DB audit logs. If you don't have a real web interface, you can manually copy the `question` field from Cosmos DB and paste it into an HTML file.
    6. **Trigger XSS:** Open the HTML page in a web browser. If the web interface (or your simulated HTML page) does not sanitize the output, the JavaScript code `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">` will be executed, and an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" should appear. This confirms the Reflected XSS vulnerability through audit logs.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can inject an XSS payload, store it in the audit logs, and potentially trigger it when the logs are viewed in a web interface that lacks output sanitization.
