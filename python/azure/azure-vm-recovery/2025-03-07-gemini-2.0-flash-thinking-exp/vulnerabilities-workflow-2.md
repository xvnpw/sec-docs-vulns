### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability 1: Sensitive Information Exposure through Command Line Arguments and Logging**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Exposure through Command Line Arguments and Logging
    - **Description:**
        The PowerShell script takes sensitive information, specifically Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password, as command-line arguments. These arguments are then printed to the console output for informational purposes. An attacker who successfully social engineers a user into running a modified version of this script can alter the script to log these command-line arguments to a file, send them over a network, or simply observe the user's screen or command history. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive Azure credentials if a malicious actor gains access to these logs, network traffic, screen recordings, or command history.

        Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker modifies the `/code/vm-zone-move/main.py` script to log command-line arguments to a file.
        2. The attacker distributes this modified `main.py` script, perhaps through a phishing email or a compromised website, tricking a user into downloading and using it.
        3. The victim, believing they are running a legitimate script, executes the modified `main.py` with their Azure subscription details and admin password from their command line.
        4. After the script executes (or even if it fails), the attacker (or the victim, if they are security conscious) checks for the log file named `sensitive_info.log` in the same directory where `main.py` was executed.
        5. The `sensitive_info.log` file will contain the victim's Azure Subscription ID and Admin Password in plaintext.

    - **Impact:**
        High. Exposure of the Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password can grant an attacker unauthorized access to the victim's Azure subscription. This access could be used to:
        - Steal or modify sensitive data stored in Azure services.
        - Deploy malicious resources within the Azure subscription.
        - Disrupt or deny service to legitimate users.
        - Incur financial charges on the victim's Azure account.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The script currently prints sensitive information to the console without any masking or secure handling.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Avoid logging sensitive information:** Refrain from printing sensitive information like subscription IDs and passwords to the console output. If logging is necessary for debugging, implement secure logging practices that mask or encrypt sensitive data.
        - **Use secure input methods:** Instead of relying solely on command-line arguments for sensitive data, consider using more secure input methods such as:
            - **Environment variables:**  Instruct users to set subscription ID and passwords as environment variables instead of passing them directly as command-line arguments. These are less likely to be inadvertently logged in command history.
            - **Azure Key Vault:** For production scenarios, integrate with Azure Key Vault to securely retrieve and manage sensitive credentials.  However, this might be overly complex for sample scripts.
            - **Interactive prompts with masking:** If command-line input is required, use secure input prompts that mask the password as it is typed, and avoid echoing the subscription ID back to the console.
        - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Add a prominent security warning in the `README.md` file, advising users:
            - To download scripts only from trusted sources.
            - To carefully review the script's code before execution, especially when it involves providing sensitive credentials.
            - To be aware of the risks of exposing credentials through command-line arguments and console output.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - An attacker must successfully social engineer a user into downloading and executing a modified version of the `main.py` script.
        - The user must provide valid Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password as command-line arguments when running the script.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/vm-zone-move/main.py`
        - Lines where vulnerability is present:
            ```python
            print(f"Subscription ID: {subscription_id}")
            print(f"New Zone: {new_zone}")
            ```
        - Step-by-step analysis:
            1. The `main.py` script uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments.
            2. Arguments `-subid` (`--subscription_id`) and `-pswd` (`--admin_password`) are defined to accept the Azure subscription ID and administrator password respectively.
            3. The script then uses f-strings to print the values of `subscription_id` and other arguments to the standard output using `print()`.
            4. This output is typically displayed on the user's console, making the sensitive `subscription_id` visible and potentially loggable in command history.
            5. A malicious modification of the script could easily extend this to log these arguments to a file or transmit them elsewhere without the user's explicit consent, if the user is tricked into running the modified script.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        - Step-by-step test:
            1. **Attacker Modification:** An attacker modifies the `/code/vm-zone-move/main.py` script to log command-line arguments to a file. Add the following lines after `args = parser.parse_args()` in `main.py`:
               ```python
               import os
               log_file = "sensitive_info.log"
               with open(log_file, "a") as f:
                   f.write(f"Timestamp: {datetime.datetime.now()}\n") # Optional timestamp
                   f.write(f"Subscription ID: {args.subscription_id}\n")
                   f.write(f"Admin Password: {args.admin_password}\n")
                   f.write("-" * 30 + "\n") # Separator for log entries
               ```
               *(Ensure `import datetime` is added at the beginning of the file if using timestamp)*
            2. **Social Engineering:** The attacker distributes this modified `main.py` script, perhaps through a phishing email or a compromised website, tricking a user into downloading and using it.
            3. **Victim Execution:** The victim, believing they are running a legitimate script, executes the modified `main.py` with their Azure subscription details and admin password from their command line:
               ```bash
               python main.py --subscription_id "YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --old_vm_name "victimvm" --new_vm_name "recoveredvm" --resource_group_name "victim-rg" --admin_password "P@$$wOrd"
               ```
            4. **Verification:** After the script executes (or even if it fails), the attacker (or the victim, if they are security conscious) checks for the log file named `sensitive_info.log` in the same directory where `main.py` was executed.
            5. **Exploit Confirmation:** The `sensitive_info.log` file will contain the victim's Azure Subscription ID and Admin Password in plaintext, demonstrating successful sensitive information exposure due to the insecure handling of command-line arguments and potential for malicious logging.

- **Vulnerability 2: Social Engineering via Malicious Package Installation**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Social Engineering via Malicious Package Installation
    - **Description:**
        An attacker can create a malicious Python package. The attacker names this package similarly to a legitimate package that might be listed in a `requirements.txt` file for this project. The attacker then hosts this malicious package on a public or rogue package repository. By impersonating a project maintainer or contributor, the attacker socially engineers users into installing this malicious package. When a user follows these compromised instructions and uses `pip install -r requirements.txt` or a similar command, they unknowingly install and execute the attacker's malicious package.

        Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker creates a malicious Python package and hosts it on a public or rogue repository.
        2. The attacker crafts malicious instructions (e.g., a modified README or a post in a forum) that instruct users to use a modified `requirements.txt` file that includes the malicious package.
        3. The attacker distributes these malicious instructions through social engineering.
        4. A user, intending to use the VM recovery scripts, follows the malicious instructions and executes `pip install -r requirements.txt` (using the malicious `requirements.txt`).
        5. The malicious code from the rogue package executes during the `pip install` process.

    - **Impact:**
        Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. Potential for data theft from the user's local system. Full compromise of the user's development environment.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The project does not include any measures to verify the integrity or source of Python packages.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Dependency Verification:** Implement and document a process for verifying the integrity and authenticity of Python packages. This could include:
            - Providing a `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions and hashes of dependencies in the official repository.
            - Instructing users to verify package hashes against a trusted source before installation.
        - **Code Signing for Releases:** If the project distributes packages directly, signing these packages would help users verify their origin and integrity.
        - **Clear Installation Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions in the official documentation, emphasizing downloading the project from the official repository and avoiding third-party sources for installation instructions.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - The user must intend to use the scripts in the `vm-zone-move` directory and follow installation instructions.
        - The attacker must successfully impersonate a trusted source and convince the user to install the malicious package.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - The file `/code/vm-zone-move/README.md` instructs users to install Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        ```
        * Install the required python packages as mentioned in requirements.txt
          * pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        - The `requirements.txt` file itself is not provided in the project files. This lack of a defined `requirements.txt` increases the risk if users are instructed to create one from potentially untrusted sources or if a malicious `requirements.txt` is distributed.
        - The project code does not include any checks or validations on the installed packages. `pip install -r requirements.txt` will blindly install whatever is listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. **Setup Malicious Package:** Create a malicious Python package named, for example, `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue`, designed to execute arbitrary code upon installation.
        2. **Host Malicious Package:** Host this `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue` package on a local PyPI server or a publicly accessible rogue repository.
        3. **Create Malicious Instructions:** Craft instructions that instruct users to use a modified `requirements.txt` file that includes `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue`.
        4. **Social Engineering:** Distribute these malicious instructions through channels where users interested in Azure VM recovery might find them.
        5. **User Execution:** A test user, intending to use the VM recovery scripts, follows the malicious instructions and executes `pip install -r requirements.txt` (using the malicious `requirements.txt`).
        6. **Verification:** Observe that the malicious code from `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue` executes during the `pip install` process.

- **Vulnerability 3: Social Engineering via Malicious Script Execution**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Social Engineering via Malicious Script Execution
    - **Description:**
        An attacker modifies the `main.py` script (or any other script intended for user execution) to include malicious code. The attacker then distributes this modified script, impersonating a project maintainer or contributor. A user, believing they are downloading and running the legitimate recovery script, executes the attacker's modified `main.py`. The malicious code embedded in the script is then executed, potentially compromising the user's Azure environment and/or their local machine.

        Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker modifies the `main.py` script to include malicious code.
        2. The attacker distributes this modified script, impersonating a project maintainer or contributor, through various channels like rogue websites, emails, or forum posts.
        3. A user, seeking a VM recovery script, is tricked into downloading and executing the attacker's modified `main.py`.
        4. Upon execution, the malicious code within the script runs, potentially compromising the user's Azure environment or local machine.

    - **Impact:**
        Compromise of the user's Azure subscription. Potential for unauthorized access to and manipulation of Azure resources, including virtual machines. Data exfiltration from Azure VMs or the user's local environment. Denial of service by disrupting or deleting Azure resources. Potential compromise of the local machine if the script interacts with local files or credentials.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The project offers no mechanism to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the scripts.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Code Signing for Scripts:** Digitally signing the scripts would allow users to verify that the scripts originate from a trusted source and have not been tampered with.
        - **Checksum Verification:** Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the scripts in the official documentation would enable users to verify the integrity of downloaded scripts.
        - **Secure Distribution Channels:** Emphasize using only official and trusted channels (e.g., the official GitHub repository) for downloading the scripts. Warn users against downloading scripts from untrusted sources.
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly preventing malicious script execution from external sources, robust input validation and sanitization within the scripts can limit the damage if a user is tricked into running a modified script with malicious inputs.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - The user must intend to use the scripts in the `vm-zone-move` directory, specifically `main.py`.
        - The attacker must successfully impersonate a trusted source and convince the user to download and execute the malicious script.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - The file `/code/vm-zone-move/README.md` instructs users to download and run `main.py` using Python.
        ```
        * Run main.py with the arguments as the details of the affected VM in the zonal outage.
        ### Example:
        python "path to main.py" --subscription_id "subscription id" --old_vm_name "old vm name" --new_vm_name "recovered vm name" --resource_group_name "resource group name" --new_zone "zone number" --admin_password "password"
        ```
        - There are no built-in checks within the project to verify the integrity of `main.py` before execution. If a user downloads and runs a modified `main.py`, the code will execute without any validation.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. **Create Malicious Script:** Modify the `main.py` script to include malicious code, such as exfiltrating Azure credentials or deleting resources.
        2. **Distribute Malicious Script:** Host this modified `main.py` on a rogue website or distribute it via email or a forum post, accompanied by instructions that mimic the legitimate usage instructions from the project's `README.md`.
        3. **Social Engineering:**  Impersonate a project maintainer or a helpful community member to encourage users to download and use this modified `main.py`.
        4. **User Execution:** A test user, intending to use the VM recovery script, is tricked into downloading and executing the malicious `main.py`.
        5. **Verification:** Observe the execution of the malicious code, confirming the potential for malicious actions due to the execution of the compromised script.
