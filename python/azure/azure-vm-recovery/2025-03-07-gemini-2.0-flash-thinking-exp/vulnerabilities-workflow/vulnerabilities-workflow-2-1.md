### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Input Validation in VM Failover Script Parameters

- **Description:**
  The VM failover script (`main.py`) accepts several command-line arguments from users, including `old_vm_name`, `new_vm_name`, `subscription_id`, `resource_group_name`, `new_zone`, and `admin_password`. These inputs are directly passed to the `FailoverService` and subsequently used in Azure API calls via the Azure SDK, without any explicit validation or sanitization within the provided code.

  Step-by-step trigger:
  1. An attacker gains access to execute the `main.py` script, either directly on the machine where it's intended to run, or indirectly if the script is exposed through an interface like a web service or API that allows parameter passing.
  2. The attacker provides malicious input as command-line arguments when executing `main.py`. For example, they could attempt to inject special characters, excessively long strings, or unexpected formats into parameters like `resource_group_name` or `old_vm_name`.
  3. The `main.py` script parses these arguments using `argparse` and passes them directly to the `FailoverService` constructor.
  4. The `FailoverService` then uses these unvalidated inputs when interacting with the Azure SDK through `CloudFactory` and `Azure` classes, specifically in methods like `get_vm` in `ComputeResourceProvider` and `get_nic` in `NetworkResourceProvider`.
  5. Although direct command injection into Azure SDK calls is unlikely, the lack of validation can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or potential logical abuse of the Azure API depending on how Azure services handle unusual resource names or IDs. While not a classical injection vulnerability, it represents a weakness in input handling that could be exploited to cause operational disruption or potentially expose underlying system behavior in unintended ways.

- **Impact:**
  The impact of this vulnerability is considered medium. While it's unlikely to lead to direct arbitrary code execution or unauthorized data access due to the use of Azure SDK which handles API interactions securely, the lack of input validation can have the following impacts:
  * **Operational Errors:** Malicious or malformed input could cause the script to fail in unexpected ways, disrupting the VM failover process.
  * **Resource Access Issues:** Although Azure RBAC provides authorization, lack of validation might lead to attempts to access or manipulate resources outside the intended scope, potentially causing errors or unexpected state changes within the Azure environment.
  * **Information Disclosure (Limited):** Error messages or unexpected behavior due to invalid input might reveal some information about the Azure environment or the script's internal workings to an attacker.
  * **Denial of Service (Indirect):** Repeated attempts with invalid inputs could potentially overload the system or Azure APIs, leading to a denial of service, although this is less likely and not the primary concern.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. The provided code does not include any input validation or sanitization for the command-line parameters.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  * **Input Validation:** Implement validation for all user-provided input parameters in `main.py` before they are used in the `FailoverService` or passed to Azure SDK calls. This should include:
    * **Format Validation:** Ensure that parameters like `subscription_id` and `new_zone` adhere to expected formats (UUID, integer, etc.).
    * **Length Validation:** Limit the length of string parameters like `old_vm_name`, `new_vm_name`, and `resource_group_name` to prevent buffer overflow or excessive resource consumption if such were possible in downstream Azure services (less likely, but good practice).
    * **Character Allow-listing/Block-listing:** Restrict the characters allowed in VM names and resource group names to alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores, or implement proper sanitization to handle special characters safely if needed.
  * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions caused by invalid input and provide informative error messages without revealing sensitive information about the system or Azure environment.
  * **Consider RBAC Enforcement in Script:** While Azure RBAC is in place, the script could explicitly perform checks to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to perform failover operations on the specified resources, adding an extra layer of security.

- **Preconditions:**
  * The attacker must have the ability to execute the `main.py` script and provide command-line arguments. This could be direct access to the server, or indirect access through a vulnerable interface that utilizes this script.
  * The Azure environment must be set up, and the script must be configured with credentials that have permissions to interact with Azure resources (though not necessarily elevated permissions, just enough to execute the failover operations).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. **`main.py`**:
     - The `argparse` module is used to define and parse command-line arguments.
     - Arguments are defined: `-oldvm`, `--old_vm_name`, `-newvm`, `--new_vm_name`, `-subid`, `--subscription_id`, `-rg`, `--resource_group_name`, `-nz`, `--new_zone`, `-pswd`, `--admin_password`.
     - The parsed arguments are directly assigned to variables: `old_vm_name = args.old_vm_name`, etc.
     - **No input validation is performed on any of these arguments.**
     - These variables are directly passed to the `FailoverService` constructor.

  2. **`service/failover_service.py`**:
     - The `FailoverService` constructor receives these arguments and stores them as class attributes.
     - The `execute_failover()` method uses these attributes to call methods of the `cloud` object (instance of `Azure` class).

  3. **`cloud/azure/azure.py`, `cloud/azure/compute_resource_provider.py`, `cloud/azure/network_resource_provider.py`**:
     - These files contain the Azure SDK interactions. For example, in `ComputeResourceProvider.get_vm()`:
       ```python
       def get_vm(self, resource_group_name: str, vm_name: str) -> VirtualMachine:
           print("GETting VM: /subscriptions/{}/resourceGroups/{}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachines/{}"
                 .format(self.subscription_id, resource_group_name, vm_name))
           return self.compute_client.virtual_machines.get(resource_group_name, vm_name)
       ```
     - The `resource_group_name` and `vm_name` parameters, which originate from user input without validation, are directly used in string formatting to construct the resource ID for the Azure API call.
     - Similarly, in `NetworkResourceProvider.get_nic()` and other methods, user-provided inputs are used without validation in API calls.

  **Visualization:**

  ```
  User Input (command-line args in main.py) --> argparse (parsing) --> Variables in main.py (NO VALIDATION) --> FailoverService constructor --> FailoverService methods --> Azure class methods --> Azure SDK calls (using unvalidated input in resource IDs/names) --> Azure API
  ```

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Deploy the `vm-zone-move` scripts to a test environment with access to an Azure subscription. Ensure you have credentials configured for the script to interact with Azure.
  2. **Execution with Malicious Input:**
     - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
     - Execute the script with an invalid `resource_group_name` containing special characters and exceeding typical naming conventions, for example:
       ```bash
       python vm-zone-move/main.py --subscription_id "your_subscription_id" --resource_group_name "invalid-rg-name~!@#$%^&*()_+=-`" --old_vm_name "testvm" --new_vm_name "recoveredvm" --admin_password "P@$$wOrd"
       ```
       Replace `"your_subscription_id"` and other placeholder values with valid test values, ensuring the `resource_group_name` is the malicious input.
  3. **Observe Behavior and Error Messages:**
     - Observe the output of the script. Check if the script throws an exception due to the invalid `resource_group_name`.
     - Examine the error messages. Check if the error messages reveal any sensitive information about the system or Azure environment.
     - Monitor the Azure activity logs (if possible) to see the actual API calls made by the script and if any errors are logged on the Azure side due to the invalid resource group name.
  4. **Expected Outcome:**
     - The script is likely to throw an exception when attempting to call Azure APIs with the invalid `resource_group_name`. The error message might originate from the Azure SDK or the script itself.
     - The test will demonstrate that while direct command injection is not achieved, the lack of input validation allows for passing invalid data to Azure APIs, which can lead to operational failures and potentially reveal error details.
  5. **Remediation and Re-test:**
     - Implement input validation in `main.py` to sanitize or validate the `resource_group_name` and other input parameters (e.g., using regular expressions or character allow-lists).
     - Re-run the same test case after implementing validation.
     - Verify that the script now either rejects the invalid input with a user-friendly error message before making Azure API calls, or handles the invalid input gracefully without causing unexpected errors or revealing sensitive information.

This test case demonstrates the vulnerability by showing how invalid user input, due to the lack of validation, can propagate to Azure API calls and cause operational issues. While not a high-severity exploit, it highlights the security weakness of missing input validation in the script.
