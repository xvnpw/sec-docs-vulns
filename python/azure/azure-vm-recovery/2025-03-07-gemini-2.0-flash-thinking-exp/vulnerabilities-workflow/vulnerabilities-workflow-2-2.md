### Vulnerability 1: Sensitive Information Exposure through Command Line Arguments and Logging

- Description:
    - The PowerShell script takes sensitive information, specifically Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password, as command-line arguments.
    - These arguments are then printed to the console output for informational purposes.
    - An attacker who successfully social engineers a user into running a modified version of this script can alter the script to log these command-line arguments to a file, send them over a network, or simply observe the user's screen or command history.
    - This could lead to the exposure of sensitive Azure credentials if a malicious actor gains access to these logs, network traffic, screen recordings, or command history.

- Impact:
    - High. Exposure of the Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password can grant an attacker unauthorized access to the victim's Azure subscription.
    - This access could be used to:
        - Steal or modify sensitive data stored in Azure services.
        - Deploy malicious resources within the Azure subscription.
        - Disrupt or deny service to legitimate users.
        - Incur financial charges on the victim's Azure account.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script currently prints sensitive information to the console without any masking or secure handling.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Avoid logging sensitive information:** Refrain from printing sensitive information like subscription IDs and passwords to the console output. If logging is necessary for debugging, implement secure logging practices that mask or encrypt sensitive data.
    - **Use secure input methods:** Instead of relying solely on command-line arguments for sensitive data, consider using more secure input methods such as:
        - **Environment variables:**  Instruct users to set subscription ID and passwords as environment variables instead of passing them directly as command-line arguments. These are less likely to be inadvertently logged in command history.
        - **Azure Key Vault:** For production scenarios, integrate with Azure Key Vault to securely retrieve and manage sensitive credentials.  However, this might be overly complex for sample scripts.
        - **Interactive prompts with masking:** If command-line input is required, use secure input prompts that mask the password as it is typed, and avoid echoing the subscription ID back to the console.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Add a prominent security warning in the `README.md` file, advising users:
        - To download scripts only from trusted sources.
        - To carefully review the script's code before execution, especially when it involves providing sensitive credentials.
        - To be aware of the risks of exposing credentials through command-line arguments and console output.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully social engineer a user into downloading and executing a modified version of the `main.py` script.
    - The user must provide valid Azure Subscription ID and VM administrator password as command-line arguments when running the script.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/vm-zone-move/main.py`
    - Lines where vulnerability is present:
        ```python
        print(f"Subscription ID: {subscription_id}")
        print(f"New Zone: {new_zone}")
        ```
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The `main.py` script uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments.
        2. Arguments `-subid` (`--subscription_id`) and `-pswd` (`--admin_password`) are defined to accept the Azure subscription ID and administrator password respectively.
        3. The script then uses f-strings to print the values of `subscription_id` and other arguments to the standard output using `print()`.
        4. This output is typically displayed on the user's console, making the sensitive `subscription_id` visible and potentially loggable in command history.
        5. A malicious modification of the script could easily extend this to log these arguments to a file or transmit them elsewhere without the user's explicit consent, if the user is tricked into running the modified script.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step-by-step test:
        1. **Attacker Modification:** An attacker modifies the `/code/vm-zone-move/main.py` script to log command-line arguments to a file. Add the following lines after `args = parser.parse_args()` in `main.py`:
           ```python
           import os
           log_file = "sensitive_info.log"
           with open(log_file, "a") as f:
               f.write(f"Timestamp: {datetime.datetime.now()}\n") # Optional timestamp
               f.write(f"Subscription ID: {args.subscription_id}\n")
               f.write(f"Admin Password: {args.admin_password}\n")
               f.write("-" * 30 + "\n") # Separator for log entries
           ```
           *(Ensure `import datetime` is added at the beginning of the file if using timestamp)*
        2. **Social Engineering:** The attacker distributes this modified `main.py` script, perhaps through a phishing email or a compromised website, tricking a user into downloading and using it.
        3. **Victim Execution:** The victim, believing they are running a legitimate script, executes the modified `main.py` with their Azure subscription details and admin password from their command line:
           ```bash
           python main.py --subscription_id "YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --old_vm_name "victimvm" --new_vm_name "recoveredvm" --resource_group_name "victim-rg" --admin_password "P@$$wOrd"
           ```
        4. **Verification:** After the script executes (or even if it fails), the attacker (or the victim, if they are security conscious) checks for the log file named `sensitive_info.log` in the same directory where `main.py` was executed.
        5. **Exploit Confirmation:** The `sensitive_info.log` file will contain the victim's Azure Subscription ID and Admin Password in plaintext, demonstrating successful sensitive information exposure due to the insecure handling of command-line arguments and potential for malicious logging.
