## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the provided lists, consolidated into a single, deduplicated list with detailed descriptions, impacts, mitigations, source code analysis, and security test cases.

### 1. Unpatched Operating System due to Disabled Unattended Upgrades

- Description:
  1. The project's default configuration, implemented through the `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` script, disables the `unattended-upgrades` service in Ubuntu operating systems. This is achieved by setting the `DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES` variable to `1` and executing commands to stop and purge the `unattended-upgrades` package.
  2. The onboarding scripts (`cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` and `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.ps1`) execute `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` during the Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) setup process.
  3. Consequently, CVMs deployed using these default scripts will not automatically receive security updates for the operating system and installed software unless the user manually re-enables unattended upgrades or implements a manual patching process.
  4. This configuration decision was made to avoid potential runtime service interruptions caused by unattended driver and kernel updates, as documented in `README.md`.
  5. Users who follow the default onboarding process are likely to unknowingly deploy CVMs with a weakened security posture if they are not aware of this configuration change or fail to manually re-enable unattended upgrades and consistently apply security patches.
  6. Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that remain unpatched on these CVMs due to the disabled automatic update mechanism, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the CVM.

- Impact:
  - **High**. By disabling automatic security updates, the project significantly increases the risk of successful exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the operating system or installed software.
  - Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to the Confidential VM.
    - Privilege escalation within the VM.
    - Data breaches and exfiltration of sensitive information processed within the CVM.
    - Installation of malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - Complete control over the Confidential VM, allowing the attacker to use it for further attacks or malicious activities.
  - In a confidential computing environment, this vulnerability undermines the fundamental security guarantees of the platform.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - Documented in `/code/README.md` under the "Updates" section, explaining the default configuration change and its rationale.
  - Instructions on how to re-enable unattended upgrades are provided in `/code/Frequently-Asked-Questions.md`.

- Missing mitigations:
  - **Re-enable unattended upgrades by default**: The onboarding scripts should be reconfigured to enable unattended upgrades by default. Automatic security updates are a critical security measure and should be enabled unless there is a very strong and well-justified reason to disable them. The current justification of potential service interruptions should be re-evaluated against the severe security risks.
  - **Provide a clear option during VM deployment**: If disabling unattended upgrades by default is maintained, the onboarding scripts (Bash and PowerShell) must provide a clear and easily accessible option for users to choose whether to enable or disable unattended upgrades during VM creation. This could be implemented via a command-line flag or an interactive prompt during script execution.
  - **Prominent Warning during VM creation**: The onboarding scripts should display a prominent warning message in the terminal output during VM creation, immediately before disabling unattended upgrades. This warning should clearly inform users that unattended upgrades are being disabled by default and explicitly highlight the significant security implications and the necessity of manual security patching. This warning should be in addition to the documentation in `README.md` and FAQ.
  - **Security Best Practices Documentation**: More comprehensive security best practices documentation should be provided, explicitly detailing the risks of disabling unattended upgrades. This documentation should include clear, step-by-step instructions on how to implement a robust manual patching process, or re-enable unattended upgrades, including recommendations for patching frequency and tools to assist in manual patching.

- Preconditions:
  - A user deploys an Azure Confidential VM using the provided onboarding scripts (`cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` or `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.ps1`).
  - The user does not manually re-enable unattended upgrades or implement a manual security patching process after deployment.
  - Publicly known exploits (CVEs) exist for vulnerabilities present in the operating system or software installed on the CVM.
  - The CVM is network accessible to potential attackers who can attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

- Source code analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/step-0-prepare-kernel.sh`
  - ```bash
    DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES=1
    # Disable Ubuntu unattended upgrades
    if [ "$DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES" = "1" ]; then
        sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
        sudo apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=300 purge -y unattended-upgrades
    fi
    ```
  - The script `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` contains the code responsible for disabling and purging the `unattended-upgrades` package. The variable `DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES` is hardcoded to `1`, enforcing the disablement by default. This script is executed by the main onboarding scripts.
  - File: `/code/src/cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.ps1` and `/code/src/cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh`
  - These scripts orchestrate the VM creation process and call `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` as part of the setup, thus inheriting the behavior of disabling unattended upgrades without providing a user-configurable option by default.

- Security test case:
  1. **Setup**: Deploy an Azure Confidential VM using the PMK flow in Bash, following the instructions in `/code/docs/Confidential-GPU-H100-Onboarding-(PMK-with-Bash).md`. Use default parameters for the onboarding script to ensure unattended upgrades are disabled as per default configuration and select Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 as the OS.
  2. **Access**: Securely connect to the deployed CVM via SSH.
  3. **Verification**:
     - Check the status of the unattended-upgrades service using the command: `systemctl is-active unattended-upgrades`. The expected output is `inactive` or `failed`.
     - Check if the `unattended-upgrades` package is installed using: `dpkg -s unattended-upgrades`. The expected output should indicate that the package is not installed (or purged).
  4. **Vulnerability Confirmation**: The successful execution of step 3 and observation of the expected output (unattended upgrades disabled) confirms the presence of the insecure default configuration.
  5. **Demonstrate Impact (Optional but Recommended)**:
     - Identify a known CVE applicable to the Ubuntu version installed on the CVM that would typically be patched by `unattended-upgrades`. Search for recent Ubuntu CVEs on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/) or Exploit-DB [https://www.exploit-db.com/](https://www.exploit-db.com/). Choose a CVE with a publicly available exploit, preferably a remote exploit.
     - Show that this CVE remains unpatched on the VM due to the disabled automatic updates, while it would be patched on a standard Ubuntu VM with unattended upgrades enabled. This step would require manual CVE research and potentially vulnerability scanning.
     - Attempt to exploit the identified CVE against the deployed CVM from an attacker machine with network access. Successful exploitation (e.g., gaining a shell or executing arbitrary commands) further demonstrates the impact of the vulnerability.

### 2. Command Injection via Unvalidated `vmname_prefix` Input

- Description:
  - The `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` script is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient input validation on the `vmname_prefix` parameter.
  - The `vmname_prefix` parameter, provided by the user, is directly incorporated into the VM name construction within a loop.
  - If a malicious user provides a `vmname_prefix` containing shell metacharacters, these characters are not sanitized before being used in the `az vm create` command.
  - Specifically, command substitution metacharacters like backticks (`` ` ``) can be injected into the `vmname_prefix`.
  - When the script constructs the VM name using string concatenation, the shell interprets and executes the commands embedded within the backticks during variable assignment.
  - This allows an attacker, through social engineering or by providing a modified script, to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running the script.

- Impact:
  - **High**. Successful command injection allows for arbitrary command execution on the user's machine executing the onboarding script.
  - This can lead to:
    - Initial access to the user's system.
    - Privilege escalation if the script is run with elevated privileges.
    - Compromise of the Azure environment by manipulating Azure CLI commands and credentials used within the script's execution context.
    - Data exfiltration or system disruption on the user's local machine.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The script lacks any input validation or sanitization for the `vmname_prefix` parameter.

- Missing mitigations:
  - **Input validation and sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `vmname_prefix` parameter in `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh`. This should include sanitizing or escaping shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.
  - **Use parameterized queries or functions**: Instead of directly concatenating user inputs into shell commands, utilize parameterized queries or functions provided by the Azure CLI SDK or secure command execution methods. This approach helps to separate commands from data, preventing injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Principle of least privilege**: Ensure that the script and the user running it operate with the minimum necessary Azure CLI permissions to reduce the potential impact of successful command injection.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker must successfully socially engineer a user into downloading and executing a modified version of the `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` script, or trick the user into providing a malicious `vmname_prefix` when running the legitimate script.
  - The user must execute the script without carefully inspecting its contents and with sufficient Azure CLI permissions to create VMs in their Azure subscription.

- Source code analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh`
  - Lines 301-308 show the vulnerable VM name construction:
    ```bash
    for ((current_vm_count=1; current_vm_count <= total_vm_number; current_vm_count++))
    do
        is_success="Succeeded"
        if [ $current_vm_count == 1 ];
        then
            vmname="${vmname_prefix}";
        else
            vmname_ending=$(($current_vm_count));
            vmname="${vmname_prefix}-${vmname_ending}"
        fi
    ```
  - Line 406 onwards, the `vmname` variable is used in the `az vm create` command:
    ```bash
    az vm create \
        --resource-group $rg \
        --name $vmname \
        ...
    ```
  - The direct string interpolation of `vmname_prefix` into `vmname`, and subsequently into the `az vm create` command, without sanitization allows for command injection if `vmname_prefix` contains malicious shell metacharacters.

- Security test case:
  1. **Prepare Malicious Script (or use original with malicious input)**: Modify `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` or use the original script and craft a malicious input for `vmname_prefix`.
     - Example malicious `vmname_prefix` input: `"test-vm\`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`\`"`
  2. **Social Engineering (or direct execution for testing)**:  Assume the role of an attacker and trick a user into downloading and running this modified script or provide the malicious input to the legitimate script. (For testing, you can directly execute the script with the malicious input.)
  3. **Execute the Script**: Execute the script (modified or original with malicious input):
     ```bash
     bash cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh -t "<tenant ID>" -s "<subscription ID>" -r "test-rg" -p "/path/to/your/public_key.pub" -i "/path/to/your/private_key" -c "./cgpu-onboarding-package.tar.gz" -a "testuser" -v "test-vm\`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`\`" -n 1
     ```
     (Replace placeholders with actual values).
  4. **Verify Command Injection**: After running the script, check if the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed. Log in to the machine where the script was run and check for the existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file.
  5. **Expected Result**: The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created, demonstrating that the injected command in `vmname_prefix` was executed during script execution. This confirms the command injection vulnerability. Alternatively, observe the script's output logs for any unexpected commands being executed or errors indicating command execution.
