### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Disabled Unattended Upgrades leading to Unpatched System

- Description:
  1. The `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` script, part of the provided onboarding package, disables the `unattended-upgrades` service in Ubuntu.
  2. This is achieved by setting `DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES=1` and then executing:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
     sudo apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=300 purge -y unattended-upgrades
     ```
  3. The onboarding scripts (`cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` and `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.ps1`) execute `step-0-prepare-kernel.sh` during VM setup.
  4. Consequently, virtual machines deployed using these scripts will have unattended upgrades disabled by default.
  5. Users following the provided documentation are guided to use these scripts for VM deployment.
  6. If users are unaware of this configuration change or fail to manually re-enable unattended upgrades or apply security patches, the deployed virtual machines will not automatically receive security updates.
  7. This leaves the virtual machines vulnerable to publicly known exploits that target unpatched software.

- Impact:
  - High. Virtual machines deployed using the provided scripts are left vulnerable to known security exploits due to disabled automatic security patching. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, malware installation, and other security incidents if users fail to manually manage patching.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Documented in `/code/README.md` under "Updates" section, explicitly stating: "Unattended-upgrades package has been removed by default...important security updates must be checked for and installed manually."
  - Documented in `/code/Frequently-Asked-Questions.md` under "Q: How can I re-enable Unattended-Upgrades?". This FAQ entry provides instructions to re-enable unattended upgrades.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Re-enable unattended upgrades by default: The onboarding scripts should not disable unattended upgrades by default. Automatic security updates are a critical security measure and should be enabled unless there is a very strong reason to disable them, which is not clearly justified in the documentation beyond potential service interruptions.
  - Prominent Warning during VM creation: The onboarding scripts should display a prominent warning message during VM creation, informing users that unattended upgrades are disabled and that manual security patching is required. This warning should be displayed in the terminal output during script execution.
  - Security Best Practices Documentation:  More comprehensive security best practices documentation should be provided, explicitly detailing the risks of disabling unattended upgrades and providing clear, step-by-step instructions on how to implement a robust manual patching process, or re-enable unattended upgrades, including frequency recommendations.

- Preconditions:
  - User deploys a Confidential GPU Virtual Machine using the provided onboarding scripts (`cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` or `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.ps1`).
  - User does not manually re-enable unattended upgrades or implement a manual security patching process.
  - Public exploits exist for vulnerabilities present in the software installed on the virtual machine.
  - The virtual machine is exposed to the network where attackers can attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/step-0-prepare-kernel.sh`
  - ```bash
    DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES=1
    # Disable Ubuntu unattended upgrades
    if [ "$DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES" = "1" ]; then
        sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
        sudo apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=300 purge -y unattended-upgrades
    fi
    ```
  - The code snippet directly disables and purges the `unattended-upgrades` package if the variable `DISABLE_UBUNTU_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES` is set to `1`.
  - This script is executed by the main onboarding scripts (`cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding.sh` and potentially via PowerShell wrapper) during the VM creation process.
  - Visualization:
    ```
    Onboarding Script (Bash/PowerShell) --> Executes step-0-prepare-kernel.sh --> Disables unattended-upgrades service and purges package
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. Precondition: An Azure account with permissions to create virtual machines and sufficient quota for NCC H100 v5 VM SKU. An attacker has access to the public internet.
  2. Action: Deploy a Confidential GPU Virtual Machine using the provided PMK flow in Bash as documented in `docs/Confidential-GPU-H100-Onboarding-(PMK-with-Bash).md`. Follow all steps to create a VM.
  3. Action: After VM deployment, log in to the VM via SSH.
  4. Action: Check the status of unattended upgrades:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status unattended-upgrades
     ```
     Expected Result: The service is shown as `inactive` or `disabled`.
  5. Action: Check if the `unattended-upgrades` package is installed:
     ```bash
     dpkg -l unattended-upgrades
     ```
     Expected Result: The package is shown as not installed (`un  unattended-upgrades`).
  6. Action: Simulate a vulnerability by checking for a known unpatched vulnerability. For example, check the installed version of `apt` and compare it against known vulnerabilities listed on public vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD). (Note: For a real-world test, you would target a specific CVE known to affect Ubuntu and check if it's patched on a default up-to-date Ubuntu system but not on the deployed VM.)
  7. Action: Attempt to exploit the simulated vulnerability (or a real CVE in a more thorough test). For example, if a vulnerability in `apt` is identified, attempt a local privilege escalation using a known exploit for that vulnerability if one exists or craft a test to simulate exploitation.
  8. Expected Result: The simulated vulnerability is exploitable because the system is not automatically patched. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access or control over the VM due to the missing security patches.
