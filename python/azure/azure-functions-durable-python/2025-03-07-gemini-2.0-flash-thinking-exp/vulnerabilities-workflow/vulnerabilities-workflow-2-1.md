- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization in Durable Functions Context

- Description:
    1. An attacker can control the input JSON payload sent to a Durable Function (Orchestrator or Entity).
    2. The Durable Functions framework uses `json.loads` with a custom object hook (`_deserialize_custom_object`) in `DurableOrchestrationContext.from_json` and `DurableEntityContext.from_json` to deserialize the input JSON payload.
    3. If the input JSON payload contains specially crafted data, the `_deserialize_custom_object` hook might be exploited to perform insecure deserialization.
    4. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server if a vulnerable class is present in the environment and can be instantiated and manipulated through the deserialization process.

- Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the Azure Functions host by crafting a malicious JSON payload, leading to full system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The code uses `json.loads` with a custom hook without any apparent sanitization or validation of the input payload against known safe schemas or types.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization to ensure that only expected and safe data types are deserialized. Use schemas to define the expected structure and types of input data.
    - Safe deserialization practices: Consider using safer deserialization methods or libraries that are less susceptible to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities. Explore options to restrict the classes that can be deserialized or use allowlists.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of potential RCE vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request or trigger an event that passes a JSON payload to a Durable Function.
    - A vulnerable Python class must be present in the Azure Functions environment that can be exploited through insecure deserialization using `_deserialize_custom_object`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Entry Points:** The `create` methods in `Orchestrator` (`azure/durable_functions/orchestrator.py`) and `Entity` (`azure/durable_functions/entity.py`) classes are entry points that call `DurableOrchestrationContext.from_json` and `DurableEntityContext.from_json` respectively. These `from_json` methods are responsible for deserializing the context from a JSON string.

    2. **`DurableOrchestrationContext.from_json` (`azure/durable_functions/models/DurableOrchestrationContext.py`):**
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def from_json(cls, json_string: str):
        ...
        json_dict = json.loads(json_string)
        return cls(**json_dict)
    ```
    This method directly uses `json.loads` to parse the input `json_string`.

    3. **`DurableEntityContext.from_json` (`azure/durable_functions/models/DurableEntityContext.py`):**
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def from_json(cls, json_str: str) -> Tuple['DurableEntityContext', List[Dict[str, Any]]]:
        ...
        json_dict = json.loads(json_str)
        ...
        serialized_state = json_dict["state"]
        if serialized_state is not None:
            json_dict["state"] = from_json_util(serialized_state)
        ...
        return cls(**json_dict), batch
    ```
    This method also uses `json.loads` and calls `from_json_util` for deserializing the state.

    4. **`from_json_util` (`azure/durable_functions/models/DurableEntityContext.py` and `azure/durable_functions/models/DurableOrchestrationContext.py`):**
    ```python
    def from_json_util(json_str: str) -> Any:
        """Load an arbitrary datatype from its JSON representation.
        ...
        """
        return json.loads(json_str, object_hook=_deserialize_custom_object)
    ```
    This utility function is used to deserialize arbitrary datatypes and it uses `json.loads` with `object_hook=_deserialize_custom_object`.

    5. **`_deserialize_custom_object` (`azure/functions/_durable_functions.py` - *not provided in project files but mentioned in code comments*):**
    This is the custom object hook that is used during deserialization. Without examining its implementation (as it's not provided), it's highly likely that it allows for instantiation of arbitrary classes based on the JSON input, which is the root cause of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[External Request (JSON Payload)] --> B(Durable Function Endpoint);
        B --> C(Orchestrator.create/Entity.create);
        C --> D(DurableOrchestrationContext.from_json/DurableEntityContext.from_json);
        D --> E(json.loads with object_hook=_deserialize_custom_object);
        E --> F{Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability?};
        F -- Yes --> G[Remote Code Execution];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a Durable Functions application using the Python library to Azure Functions. Ensure that the application has an HTTP trigger orchestrator function.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a malicious JSON payload that exploits insecure deserialization. This payload will depend on the implementation of `_deserialize_custom_object` and the available vulnerable classes in the Azure Functions environment. A typical payload might attempt to instantiate a class that executes commands upon instantiation or during deserialization.
    3. **Send Malicious Request:** Send an HTTP POST request to the HTTP trigger endpoint of the Durable Function, including the crafted JSON payload as the request body. The orchestrator function name should be specified in the URL.
    4. **Observe Behavior:** Monitor the Azure Functions logs and the behavior of the application. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, you might observe code execution on the server, unexpected errors, or other signs of compromise.
    5. **Example Payload (Conceptual - needs adaptation based on `_deserialize_custom_object` and environment):**
    ```json
    {
        "__class__": "subprocess.Popen",
        "args": ["whoami"],
        "stdout": -1,
        "stderr": -1,
        "shell": true
    }
    ```
    This is a conceptual example and might not directly work without adjustments for `_deserialize_custom_object` and the target environment. A real exploit would require reverse engineering `_deserialize_custom_object` and identifying exploitable classes within the Azure Functions runtime environment.
    6. **Expected Outcome:** Successful exploitation would result in remote code execution. If the test is designed to be less intrusive, it should at least demonstrate the ability to deserialize unexpected objects or trigger errors related to deserialization. If the system is patched or mitigations are in place, the test should not result in code execution or unexpected behavior, and input validation or safe deserialization mechanisms should be observed in the code.
