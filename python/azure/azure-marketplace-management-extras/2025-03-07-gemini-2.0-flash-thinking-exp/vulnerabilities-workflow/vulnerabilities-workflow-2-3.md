### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Input Validation in Resource ID Parsing leading to potential Resource Scope Manipulation

*   #### Description:
    1.  The Notification Endpoint Azure Function receives deployment event data via HTTP POST requests.
    2.  The function extracts the `applicationId` from the JSON request body.
    3.  The `parse_resource_id` function is used to parse the `applicationId` string using a regular expression to extract the subscription ID, resource group name, and application name.
    4.  The extracted subscription ID and resource group name are then used to interact with Azure resources, such as fetching managed application details and storing data in Azure Table Storage.
    5.  The `parse_resource_id` function, while using a regex, does not perform sufficient validation to ensure that the parsed resource ID components are within the expected scope or format for the managed application.
    6.  If an attacker can somehow influence the `applicationId` in the incoming webhook request (even indirectly, through misconfiguration or other vulnerabilities in the overall managed application deployment process), they could potentially craft a malicious `applicationId`.
    7.  A crafted `applicationId` could, after parsing, lead to the function operating within a different Azure subscription or resource group than intended by the managed application owner.
    8.  For example, an attacker could attempt to modify the `applicationId` to point to a resource group they control or have access to.
    9.  If the Managed Application service principal used by the function has overly broad permissions (e.g., Owner or Contributor at the subscription level), this could allow an attacker to leverage the function to perform actions (like data manipulation in Table Storage or potentially other Azure API calls if further functionality is added) in the context of the attacker-controlled resource group or subscription, using the function's elevated permissions.

*   #### Impact:
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to manipulate data within the Azure Table Storage by crafting requests that cause the function to store or delete information associated with a different, attacker-controlled resource context. This could lead to incorrect monitoring data, reporting, or other operational issues for the managed application owner.
    *   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure (Potential):**  While not immediately evident in the current code, if future versions of the function were to use the parsed resource ID components to retrieve or process sensitive information from Azure resources based on the manipulated resource scope, it could lead to unauthorized information disclosure.
    *   **Resource Hijacking (Potential):** In a more severe scenario, if the function's logic were extended to perform actions beyond data storage (e.g., triggering actions on Azure resources based on policy states or events, and if these actions are based on the parsed resource IDs without proper validation), an attacker could potentially hijack or misuse resources in the manipulated scope, depending on the permissions of the function's service principal.

*   #### Vulnerability Rank: Medium

*   #### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   **Request Method Validation:** The function checks if the request method is POST and returns 405 for other methods. This prevents the function from responding to unexpected HTTP methods, but does not mitigate the input validation vulnerability within POST requests.
    *   **JSON Parsing Error Handling:** The function includes try-except blocks to catch `ValueError`, `KeyError`, and `AttributeError` during JSON parsing and key extraction. This prevents the function from crashing due to malformed JSON, but doesn't validate the *content* of the JSON data, specifically the `applicationId`.

*   #### Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Resource ID Format Validation:** Implement stricter validation of the `applicationId` format beyond just the regex parsing. This could involve:
        *   Verifying that the parsed subscription ID and resource group name conform to expected patterns or a whitelist of allowed values.
        *   Checking if the `applicationId` belongs to the expected Azure tenant.
    *   **Scope Authorization:** Before performing any actions based on the parsed resource ID components (especially when interacting with Azure resources or Table Storage), implement authorization checks to ensure that the function is indeed operating within the intended scope of the managed application. This could involve:
        *   Retrieving the expected subscription and resource group for the managed application from a trusted source (e.g., configuration or pre-validated data).
        *   Comparing the parsed subscription ID and resource group name against the expected values.
        *   Implementing Azure RBAC checks to verify that the function's service principal has the necessary permissions *within the specific managed application's scope* and not broadly across subscriptions.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While not a direct fix for scope manipulation, sanitizing the parsed resource ID components before using them in Azure SDK calls or Table Storage operations can help prevent potential injection attacks if vulnerabilities are present in the underlying SDKs or storage mechanisms.

*   #### Preconditions:
    1.  The Notification Endpoint Azure Function is deployed and configured to receive webhook notifications from Azure Marketplace Managed Applications.
    2.  The Managed Application service principal used by the Notification Endpoint function has overly permissive roles assigned (e.g., Owner, Contributor, or broad custom roles) that extend beyond the specific scope of the managed applications it is intended to manage.
    3.  An attacker has the ability to trigger or influence webhook requests sent to the Notification Endpoint, potentially through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the managed application deployment process, or by gaining access to systems that can send such requests.

*   #### Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`NotificationHandler/__init__.py` - `main` function:**
        ```python
        def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
            # ...
            try:
                req_body = req.get_json() # [1] Get JSON request body
                logging.debug(f"Request body: {req_body}")
                application_id = req_body["applicationId"] # [2] Extract applicationId
                event_type = req_body["eventType"] # [3] Extract eventType
                provisioning_state = req_body["provisioningState"] # [4] Extract provisioningState
            except (ValueError, KeyError, AttributeError) as e:
                msg = f"Could not parse request: {e}"
                logging.error(msg)
                return func.HttpResponse(msg, status_code=400)

            try:
                (
                    app_subscription_id, # [5] Parse applicationId to get subscription ID
                    app_resource_group, # [6] Parse applicationId to get resource group
                    app_name             # [7] Parse applicationId to get application name
                ) = parse_resource_id(application_id) # [8] Call parse_resource_id function
            except ValueError as e:
                msg = f"Error obtaining app subscription and resource group: {e}"
                logging.error(msg)
                return func.HttpResponse(msg, status_code=500)

            # ... (Table Storage interaction using app_subscription_id, app_name, etc.)
        ```
        -   **[1-4]**: The code retrieves the JSON request body and extracts `applicationId`, `eventType`, and `provisioningState` without any validation of the content or format of `applicationId`.
        -   **[5-8]**: The `parse_resource_id` function is called to parse the `applicationId`. The function's implementation is analyzed below. The parsed components `app_subscription_id`, `app_resource_group`, and `app_name` are directly used in subsequent operations, including Table Storage interactions, without further validation of their scope or legitimacy.

    2.  **`NotificationHandler/__init__.py` - `parse_resource_id` function:**
        ```python
        def parse_resource_id(resource_id: str):
            pattern = "\/?subscriptions\/(?P<subscription_id>[0-9a-z-]+)\/resourceGroups\/(?P<resource_group>[a-zA-Z0-9-_.()]+)(|\/providers\/Microsoft\.Solutions\/applications\/(?P<application_name>[a-zA-Z0-_.()]+))$"
            m = re.match(pattern, resource_id) # [1] Regex matching

            if not m:
                raise ValueError("Could not parse resource id")
            return (
                m.group("subscription_id"), # [2] Extract subscription_id
                m.group("resource_group"),  # [3] Extract resource_group
                m.group("application_name") # [4] Extract application_name
            )
        ```
        -   **[1]**: The `parse_resource_id` function uses a regular expression to parse the resource ID. While the regex itself provides some level of format checking, it is not sufficient to validate the *scope* or *trustworthiness* of the resource ID. It primarily checks for a specific string pattern.
        -   **[2-4]**: The function extracts the named groups from the regex match (`subscription_id`, `resource_group`, `application_name`) and returns them. These extracted values are assumed to be valid and are used without further validation in the `main` function to interact with Azure services.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Webhook Request --> NotificationHandler Function --> parse_resource_id() --> Parsed Resource ID Components (Unvalidated) --> Azure SDK Calls / Table Storage Operations (Potentially in unintended scope)
    ```

*   #### Security Test Case:
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Deploy the Notification Endpoint Azure Function.
        *   Obtain the function's HTTP endpoint URL.
        *   Ensure you have an Azure account and subscription where you can create resources and observe Azure Table Storage.
        *   Identify a valid `applicationId` of a deployed Managed Application that the function is intended to monitor (let's call this `VALID_APPLICATION_ID`).
        *   Prepare a *malicious* `applicationId` (let's call this `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID`) crafted as follows:
            *   Keep the general format of a resource ID: `/subscriptions/<attacker_subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<attacker_resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Solutions/applications/<attacker_application_name>`
            *   Replace `<attacker_subscription_id>` and `<attacker_resource_group>` with the ID and name of a subscription and resource group that you control or have access to for testing purposes.
            *   `<attacker_application_name>` can be any valid application name format.
        *   Create an Azure Storage Table (if it doesn't exist) that the Notification Endpoint function is configured to use, either in your attacker-controlled resource group or another test environment where you can monitor it.

    2.  **Steps:**
        *   Construct a JSON payload mimicking a valid webhook request, but replace the `applicationId` with `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID`. For example, starting with a valid `test_event_ok.json` and modifying the `applicationId` field.
        ```json
        {
            "eventType": "PUT",
            "applicationId": "/subscriptions/<attacker_subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<attacker_resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Solutions/applications/malicious-app",
            "eventTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.0000000Z",
            "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
            "plan": {
                "name": "test-plan",
                "product": "test-product",
                "publisher": "test-publisher",
                "version": "1.0"
            }
        }
        ```
        *   Send an HTTP POST request to the Notification Endpoint function's URL with the crafted JSON payload as the request body. You can use `curl`, `Postman`, or any HTTP client.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @malicious_payload.json <NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT_URL>/resource
        ```
        *   Monitor the logs of the Notification Endpoint Azure Function. Check if the function processes the request without errors and extracts the subscription ID and resource group name from the `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID`.
        *   Check the Azure Storage Table that the function writes to. Observe if a new entity has been created in the table using the parsed components from `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID` (specifically, the attacker's subscription ID and resource group name as PartitionKey and potentially within other fields like `mrg_name`).

    3.  **Expected Result:**
        *   The function should respond with an HTTP 200 OK, indicating successful processing of the request (as per the design to always return 200 to avoid retries, even if the event is ignored or invalid in some sense).
        *   The function logs should show that it has processed the request and extracted the subscription ID and resource group name from `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID`.
        *   An entity should be created or updated in the Azure Storage Table. Critically, the `PartitionKey` and potentially other fields in the table entity should reflect the *attacker-controlled* subscription ID and resource group name from `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID`, instead of values associated with the legitimate `VALID_APPLICATION_ID` or the intended managed application scope.

    4.  **Success Condition:**
        If the Azure Storage Table contains an entity with data derived from the `MALICIOUS_APPLICATION_ID` (especially using the attacker's subscription and resource group), it demonstrates that the function has processed and acted upon the crafted, potentially out-of-scope resource ID, confirming the vulnerability. This indicates that an attacker could manipulate the function to store data in Table Storage under an unintended resource context, and potentially exploit this further if the function's logic is expanded in the future.
