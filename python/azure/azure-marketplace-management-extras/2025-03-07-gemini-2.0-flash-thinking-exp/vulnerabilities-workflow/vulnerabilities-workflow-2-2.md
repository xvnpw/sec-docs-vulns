Based on the provided instructions and the vulnerability description, let's evaluate if the vulnerability should be included in the updated list.

**Evaluation against inclusion criteria:**

* **Valid vulnerability:** Yes, insufficient input validation is a valid type of vulnerability.
* **Part of attack vector:** Yes, the vulnerability is directly related to the described attack vector of sending crafted payloads to the Notification Endpoint.

**Evaluation against exclusion criteria:**

* **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** No, the vulnerability describes missing *implementation* of robust input validation, not just documentation.
* **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** No, the described impact is not related to denial of service.
* **Not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world:** No, exploiting input validation vulnerabilities by sending crafted payloads to a public endpoint is a realistic attack scenario.
* **Not completely described:** No, the vulnerability description includes detailed steps, source code analysis, and a security test case.
* **Only theoretical:** No, the source code analysis and test case demonstrate the potential for exploitation, even if the current impact is low.
* **Not high or critical severity:** **Yes**, the vulnerability rank is explicitly stated as "Low". This is an exclusion criterion.

**Conclusion:**

Although the vulnerability is valid, part of the attack vector, and realistically exploitable, it is explicitly ranked as "Low" severity. According to the instructions, vulnerabilities that are "not high or critical severity" should be excluded.

Therefore, based on the provided criteria, this vulnerability should be excluded from the list.

**Final Answer:**
