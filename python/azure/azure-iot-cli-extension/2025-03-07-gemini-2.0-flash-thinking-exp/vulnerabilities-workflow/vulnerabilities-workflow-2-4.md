- Vulnerability Name: **Command Injection via Shell Scripts in Device Update Manifests**
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Device Update manifest containing embedded shell scripts (e.g., install.sh, action.sh, configure.sh).
    2. The attacker social engineers a user into deploying this malicious manifest to their Azure IoT Hub Device Update instance using the `az iot du update import` and `az iot du device update` commands.
    3. When the Device Update service processes the deployment, the malicious shell scripts embedded in the manifest are executed on the target IoT devices.
    4. These scripts can execute arbitrary commands, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access, control, or compromise the targeted IoT devices.
- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution on vulnerable IoT devices.
    - Full compromise of affected IoT devices.
    - Potential for lateral movement to other devices or systems within the network.
    - Data breach and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input validation or sanitization is implemented for Device Update manifest content, specifically shell scripts, within the provided project files. Therefore, there are no implemented mitigations within the code itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all fields within Device Update manifests, especially for script paths and inline script content.
    - Restrict the execution of shell scripts from within Device Update manifests altogether, or severely limit their capabilities and enforce strict security policies.
    - Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on the `az iot du update` command processing logic to identify and eliminate any potential command injection points.
    - Develop and execute automated security tests, including fuzzing and penetration testing, to proactively detect command injection and other vulnerabilities in Device Update manifest handling.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to create a malicious Device Update manifest file.
    - The attacker relies on social engineering to trick a user into using the Azure CLI `iot du` commands to deploy the attacker's crafted manifest.
    - The user must have an Azure account with permissions to manage Device Update instances and devices, and must be using the Azure CLI with the `azure-iot` extension installed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Files: `/code/azext_iot/tests/deviceupdate/manifests/surface15/install.sh`, `/code/azext_iot/tests/deviceupdate/manifests/surface15/action.sh`, `/code/azext_iot/tests/deviceupdate/manifests/delta/configure.sh` serve as examples of shell scripts within Device Update manifests.
    - Review the source code of the `az iot du update import` and `az iot du device update` commands, specifically looking for how the `content` parameter (manifest file) is processed.
    - Identify the code paths that handle the `instructions` section of the manifest and how the `handler` and `files` properties are processed.
    - Analyze how the Azure CLI extension interacts with the Device Update service to deploy the manifest and if the service itself performs any validation or sanitization.
    - Look for any instances of shell command execution using libraries like `subprocess` or `os.system` where the arguments are derived from the manifest content without proper sanitization.
    - **Analysis of PROJECT FILES batch 2**: The provided files are related to Device Provisioning Service (DPS) and SDK for Device Update and Digital Twins. They are mostly model definitions and SDK client code generation. No new command injection vulnerabilities are found in these files. The existing vulnerability related to Device Update manifests remains valid and unmitigated by the code in this batch of files.
    - **Analysis of PROJECT FILES batch 3**: The provided files are related to IoT Central functionality. After reviewing the files in PROJECT FILES batch 3, specifically `/code/azext_iot/central/params.py`, `/code/azext_iot/central/commands_job.py`, `/code/azext_iot/central/commands_device_group.py`, `/code/azext_iot/central/commands_device_template.py`, `/code/azext_iot/central/services` and `/code/azext_iot/central/providers` directories, I have not identified any new command injection or other high-risk vulnerabilities. The code primarily deals with parameter parsing, API call construction, and service logic for interacting with Azure IoT Central. There is no evidence of unsanitized input being directly used in shell commands or other risky operations within these files. The code appears to be focused on interacting with REST APIs securely.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious shell script file named `malicious.sh` with the following content:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Vulnerable" > /tmp/vulnerable.txt
    ```
    2. Create a Device Update manifest file named `malicious_manifest.json` and include the malicious script as a file within a step:
    ```json
    {
      "manifestVersion": "5.0",
      "updateId": {
        "provider": "contoso",
        "name": "maliciousUpdate",
        "version": "1.0.0"
      },
      "compatibility": [],
      "instructions": {
        "steps": [
          {
            "type": "inline",
            "handler": "microsoft/script:1",
            "files": [
              "malicious.sh"
            ],
            "handlerProperties": {
              "installedCriteria": "installed"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      "files": [
        {
          "filename": "malicious.sh",
          "hashes": {
            "sha256": "e1e0144254495793854454a156689a75e154194f28a9a6169642fa4d0bb00bb2"
          },
          "sizeInBytes": 43
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    3. Host both `malicious.sh` and `malicious_manifest.json` files in a publicly accessible location (e.g., GitHub repository, Azure Blob Storage with SAS token).
    4. Using the Azure CLI with the IoT extension, import the malicious manifest into a Device Update account:
    ```bash
    az iot du update import -n <device_update_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --manifest https://<public_url>/malicious_manifest.json
    ```
    5. Create a device group within the Device Update instance and deploy the malicious update to it:
    ```bash
    az iot du device update -n <device_update_account_name> -i <device_update_instance_name> --group-id maliciousGroup
    az iot du device update -n <device_update_account_name> -i <device_update_instance_name> --group-id maliciousGroup --update-name maliciousUpdate --update-provider contoso --update-version 1.0.0
    ```
    6. Monitor the targeted IoT devices within the device group. If successful, the `malicious.sh` script will execute, and evidence of command injection will be present (e.g., the file `/tmp/vulnerable.txt` will be created on the device).
    7. Check device logs or access the device directly (if possible) to verify the creation of `/tmp/vulnerable.txt`, confirming successful command injection.
