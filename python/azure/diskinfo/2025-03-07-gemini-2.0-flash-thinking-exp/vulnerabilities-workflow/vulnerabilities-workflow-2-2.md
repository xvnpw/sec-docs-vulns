- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Output Directory
- Description:
    1. The tool accepts a command-line argument to specify the output directory for telemetry JSON files.
    2. The `runner.py` script parses this argument using `ArgumentParser` and stores it in `options.file`.
    3. The `collectDiskInfo` function in `src/sequencer.py` calls `outputData` from `src/datahandle.py`, passing `options.file` as the `result_folder` argument.
    4. The `outputData` function in `src/datahandle.py` uses `os.path.join(result_folder, result_file)` to construct the full path for the output file.
    5. The `os.path.join` function concatenates the user-provided `result_folder` with the filename without proper sanitization.
    6. An attacker can provide a malicious path like "../../" as the output directory.
    7. `os.path.join` resolves this path, allowing the tool to write JSON files to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary File Write: An attacker can control the destination path of the output JSON files.
    - Overwrite Sensitive Files: By crafting a path traversal payload, an attacker could potentially overwrite sensitive system files, leading to system instability or privilege escalation.
    - Write to Protected Directories: Attackers might be able to write files to directories where they normally lack write permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the user-provided path in `os.path.join` without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization for the output directory path provided by the user.
    - Path Validation: Validate the user-provided path to ensure it is within an expected or allowed directory.
    - Use `os.path.abspath` to resolve the provided path and then check if it is a subdirectory of a designated safe output directory. Alternatively, if the intention is to only allow output to a specific directory, consider using `os.path.basename` on the user input and joining it to a fixed output directory path.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `runner.py` script.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide command-line arguments to the script, specifically the output directory path.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/sequencer.py`
        ```python
        from argparse       import ArgumentParser
        # ...
        def collectDiskInfo(classifier):
            # ...
            parser = ArgumentParser(description=usage)
            parser.add_argument("file", default=".", nargs="?") # Output directory argument
            # ...
            options = parser.parse_args()
            # ...
            outputData(device_dict, options.file, options.output) # Passing user input to outputData
        ```
    - File: `/code/src/datahandle.py`
        ```python
        import os
        import json
        # ...
        def outputData(dict, result_folder, outputToScreen):
            # ...
            result_file = "diskData{0}.json".format(int(dict['DeviceId']))
            # Vulnerable path construction using user input 'result_folder'
            with open(os.path.join(result_folder, result_file), 'w') as f:
                json.dump(dict, f, indent=2)
        ```
    - Visualization:
        ```
        User Input (directory) --> runner.py (ArgumentParser "file") --> options.file --> sequencer.py (collectDiskInfo) --> outputData(options.file) --> datahandle.py (os.path.join(result_folder, ...)) --> File System (Arbitrary Write)
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Open a command-line interface in the project's root directory.
    2. Execute the `runner.py` script with a path traversal payload as the output directory argument:
        ```bash
        python runner.py "../../traversal_test_output"
        ```
    3. After execution, check the parent directory of the project's root (or further up depending on the payload, in this case two levels up).
    4. Verify if a file named `diskData<disk_number>.json` (e.g., `diskData0.json`, `diskData1.json`) has been created in the `traversal_test_output` directory, which is located outside the intended project directory.
    5. If the file is found in the `traversal_test_output` directory outside the project, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the tool wrote data to a location outside the intended output directory based on user-controlled path manipulation.
