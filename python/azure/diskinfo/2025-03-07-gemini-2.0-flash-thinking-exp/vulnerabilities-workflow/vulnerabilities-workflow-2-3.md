- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Output Directory Argument

- Description:
  1. The `runner.py` script accepts a positional argument which is intended to be the output directory for telemetry data.
  2. This argument is passed directly to the `outputData` function in `datahandle.py` as `result_folder`.
  3. The `outputData` function uses `os.path.join(result_folder, result_file)` to construct the full path for the output JSON file, where `result_file` is derived from the disk's DeviceId.
  4. If a user provides an absolute path as the output directory argument (e.g., `C:\Users\Public` on Windows or `/tmp` on Linux), the `os.path.join` function will treat this as the base path.
  5. Consequently, the telemetry output file will be written directly into the user-specified absolute path, instead of being restricted to a safe or intended location within the project's directory.
  6. This allows an attacker to control the output directory and potentially write telemetry data to arbitrary locations on the file system.

- Impact:
  - An attacker can write telemetry output files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
  - This could lead to overwriting existing files if the attacker has write permissions to the target directory and if the generated filename clashes with an existing file.
  - While the tool outputs JSON files, which are not directly executable, writing to sensitive system directories or user directories could have security implications depending on the context and permissions. For example, overwriting user configuration files or placing data in publicly accessible folders.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly uses the user-provided directory argument without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization of the output directory path in `runner.py`.
  - Restricting the output directory to a predefined safe location within the project's directory or a designated temporary directory.
  - Validating that the provided path is a relative path and preventing the use of absolute paths.
  - Implementing proper error handling and logging if the specified output directory is invalid or inaccessible.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to execute the `runner.py` script.
  - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the `runner.py` script, specifically the output directory argument.
  - The attacker needs write permissions to the directory they specify as the output directory.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/runner.py`
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        collectDiskInfo(classify)
    ```
    - `runner.py` directly calls `collectDiskInfo` to start the telemetry collection process.

  - File: `/code/src/sequencer.py`
    ```python
    from argparse       import ArgumentParser
    # ...
    def collectDiskInfo(classifier):
        # ...
        usage = "python runner.py outputDirectory [options]"
        parser = ArgumentParser(description=usage)
        parser.add_argument("file", default=".", nargs="?") # "file" argument is the output directory
        options = parser.parse_args()
        # ...
        outputData(device_dict, options.file, options.output) # options.file (user input) is passed to outputData
        # ...
    ```
    - In `sequencer.py`, the `collectDiskInfo` function uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
    - `parser.add_argument("file", default=".", nargs="?")` defines a positional argument named "file", which is intended to be the output directory. The default value is "." (current directory).
    - The value of this "file" argument is stored in `options.file` and is directly passed to the `outputData` function.

  - File: `/code/src/datahandle.py`
    ```python
    import os
    import json
    # ...
    def outputData(dict, result_folder, outputToScreen):
        result_file = "diskData{0}.json".format(int(dict['DeviceId']))
        logging.info(json.dumps(dict, indent=2))
        with open(os.path.join(result_folder, result_file), 'w') as f: # os.path.join is used to create file path
            json.dump(dict, f, indent=2)
    ```
    - In `datahandle.py`, the `outputData` function receives `result_folder` as input.
    - `os.path.join(result_folder, result_file)` is used to construct the full path for the output file. `os.path.join` is intended to create platform-independent paths, but it does not prevent path traversal if `result_folder` is an absolute path provided by the user.
    - The `open()` function then uses this constructed path to create and write the JSON telemetry data to the specified location.

  - Visualization:

    ```
    runner.py --output-dir /tmp
        |
        V
    sequencer.py (collectDiskInfo)
        |  (options.file = "/tmp")
        V
    datahandle.py (outputData)
        |  (result_folder = "/tmp")
        V
    os.path.join("/tmp", "diskData{DeviceId}.json")  -->  /tmp/diskData{DeviceId}.json
    open("/tmp/diskData{DeviceId}.json", 'w')       -->  File created in /tmp directory
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
  2. Navigate to the directory where `runner.py` is located.
  3. Execute the following command to attempt to write the output to the `C:\Users\Public` directory on Windows (or `/tmp` on Linux/macOS):
     ```bash
     python runner.py "C:\Users\Public"
     ```
     (or)
     ```bash
     python runner.py /tmp
     ```
  4. Observe the output of the script for any errors. If the script runs successfully without errors (and assuming you have write permissions to the specified directory), check the `C:\Users\Public` (or `/tmp`) directory.
  5. Verify that a file named `diskData<DeviceId>.json` (where `<DeviceId>` is the device ID of a detected storage device) has been created in the `C:\Users\Public` (or `/tmp`) directory.
  6. If the file is created in the specified directory, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the output was written to a user-controlled arbitrary location outside the intended project directory.
