### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. Exposure of Client Secret in Terraform Configurations
  - Description:
    1. The Terraform templates `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-apply.yml` and `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-plan.yml` use an Azure DevOps variable `CLIENT_SECRET` to pass the client secret to Terraform.
    2. This variable is passed as a command-line argument to Terraform: `-var "client_secret=$(CLIENT_SECRET)"`.
    3. If the Azure DevOps pipeline configuration or logs are not properly secured, or if the `CLIENT_SECRET` variable is not handled as a secret within Azure DevOps, it could be exposed to unauthorized users.
    4. An attacker with access to the pipeline definition or logs could potentially retrieve the client secret.
  - Impact:
    - If the client secret is compromised, an attacker could use it to authenticate as the service principal associated with the Azure service connection `ado_service_connection_rg`.
    - This could allow the attacker to manage Azure resources within the subscription, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, or denial of service.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the provided code. Azure DevOps itself provides mechanisms to mark variables as secret, which prevents them from being displayed in logs, but this is a configuration outside of the provided code.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - The templates should avoid directly passing secrets as command-line arguments.
    - Instead, Terraform should be configured to retrieve the client secret from a more secure source, such as Azure Key Vault or Azure DevOps secret store in a more secure way (not as `-var` in command line).
    - Ideally, Managed Identity should be used to avoid secrets management.
  - Preconditions:
    - An Azure DevOps service connection `ado_service_connection_rg` is configured using a service principal that requires a client secret.
    - The Azure DevOps pipeline is configured to use the Terraform templates and the `CLIENT_SECRET` variable is populated with the service principal's client secret.
    - An attacker gains access to the Azure DevOps pipeline definition or pipeline execution logs.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-apply.yml`
      ```yaml
      steps:
        - task: TerraformTaskV2@2
          displayName: 'Terraform apply'
          inputs:
            provider: 'azurerm'
            command: 'apply'
            workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(terraform_workingdir)'
            commandOptions: '-var "location=$(location)" -var "prefix=$(namespace)" -var "postfix=$(postfix)" -var "environment=$(environment)" -var "enable_aml_computecluster=$(enable_aml_computecluster)" -var "enable_monitoring=$(enable_monitoring)" -var "client_secret=$(CLIENT_SECRET)"'
            environmentServiceNameAzureRM: '$(ado_service_connection_rg)'
      ```
    - File: `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-plan.yml`
      ```yaml
      steps:
        - task: TerraformTaskV2@2
          displayName: 'Terraform plan'
          inputs:
            provider: 'azurerm'
            command: 'plan'
            workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(terraform_workingdir)'
            commandOptions: '-var "location=$(location)" -var "prefix=$(namespace)" -var "postfix=$(postfix)" -var "environment=$(environment)" -var "enable_aml_computecluster=$(enable_aml_computecluster)" -var "enable_monitoring=$(enable_monitoring)" -var "client_secret=$(CLIENT_SECRET)"'
            environmentServiceNameAzureRM: '$(ado_service_connection_rg)'
      ```
      - In both files, the `commandOptions` input for the `TerraformTaskV2@2` task includes `-var "client_secret=$(CLIENT_SECRET)"`. This directly passes the value of the `CLIENT_SECRET` Azure DevOps variable to Terraform as a variable named `client_secret`.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up an Azure DevOps project and pipeline.
    2. Configure an Azure service connection `ado_service_connection_rg` using a service principal with a client secret.
    3. Define a pipeline variable named `CLIENT_SECRET` and set its value to the client secret of the service principal. Mark the variable as *not* secret for testing purposes to ensure it is visible in logs (in real scenario it would be secret, but still passed as command line arg).
    4. Create a pipeline stage that uses the `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-apply.yml` or `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-plan.yml` template.
    5. Run the pipeline.
    6. Examine the pipeline execution logs for the Terraform task.
    7. Verify that the client secret is visible in the logs as part of the Terraform command line arguments, e.g., `-var "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"`.

#### 2. Misconfigured Azure DevOps Service Connections Leading to Unauthorized Azure Resource Access
  - Description:
    1. Several Azure DevOps pipeline templates in this project rely on Azure Service Connections (e.g., `ado_service_connection_aml_ws`, `ado_service_connection_rg`) to authenticate with Azure and manage resources. Specifically, the `ado_service_connection_rg` is frequently used to execute Azure CLI tasks at the Resource Group level.
    2. An attacker could exploit misconfigurations in these service connections if they are granted overly broad permissions in Azure Active Directory or are scoped to the wrong Azure subscription or resource group.
    3. For example, if `ado_service_connection_rg` has "Contributor" role at the subscription level instead of resource group level, pipelines using this connection could potentially manage resources outside of the intended resource group.
    4. Similarly, if the service principal associated with the service connection has excessive permissions, an attacker who gains access to the Azure DevOps project or pipeline execution context could leverage these permissions to perform unauthorized actions on Azure resources.
  - Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to Azure Machine Learning workspaces and related resources (storage accounts, compute clusters, endpoints, etc.).
    - Data exfiltration or modification from storage accounts.
    - Unauthorized modification or deletion of ML models, endpoints, and deployments.
    - Resource manipulation leading to service disruption or financial impact.
    - Unauthorized access and modification of Azure resources within the Resource Group and potentially the subscription.
    - Data breaches through unauthorized access to storage accounts or databases.
    - Denial of service by deleting or misconfiguring critical resources.
    - Lateral movement to other Azure resources if the service principal has broader permissions.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the provided code templates. The security relies on the user correctly configuring Azure DevOps service connections.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation and guidance on the principle of least privilege for service connection configuration.
    - Validation or checks within the templates to warn users about overly permissive service connection configurations (though this might be difficult to implement directly within YAML templates).
    - Security scanning or policy enforcement at the Azure DevOps organization or Azure subscription level to detect and remediate overly permissive service connections.
    - Principle of least privilege: Document and enforce the requirement to grant the `ado_service_connection_rg` service connection only the minimum necessary permissions. Ideally, use custom roles with granular permissions instead of built-in roles like "Contributor".
    - Clearly document the required permissions for each service connection in the project's README or security documentation.
    - Consider using separate service connections with more restricted scopes for different tasks if possible.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user deploys MLOps infrastructure using the provided templates.
    - Azure DevOps service connections (`ado_service_connection_aml_ws`, `ado_service_connection_rg`) are created with overly permissive roles or incorrect scope. Specifically, `ado_service_connection_rg` Azure DevOps service connection is configured with overly permissive roles at the Resource Group level (e.g., "Contributor" or "Owner").
    - An attacker gains access to the Azure DevOps project or pipeline execution context (e.g., through compromised credentials, insider threat, or supply chain attack).
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Files like `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-deployment.yml`, `/code/templates/python-sdk-v2/create-online-endpoint.yml`, `/code/templates/infra/run-terraform-apply.yml` all use `azureSubscription` input, which refers to Azure DevOps service connection.
    - The `AzureCLI@2` and `TerraformTaskV2@2` tasks use this service connection to authenticate with Azure.
    - Example from `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-deployment.yml`:
      ```yaml
      steps:
        - task: AzureCLI@2
          displayName: Create deployment
          inputs:
            azureSubscription: $(ado_service_connection_rg) #needs to have access at the RG level
            scriptType: bash
            scriptLocation: inlineScript
            inlineScript: |
              # ... Azure CLI commands to create deployment ...
      ```
    - Multiple files across `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2` and `/code/templates/python-sdk-v*` folders consistently use `azureSubscription: $(ado_service_connection_rg)` for AzureCLI@2 tasks. Examples: `create-deployment.yml`, `allocate-traffic.yml`, `register-data.yml`, `create-endpoint.yml`, `create-compute.yml`, `register-environment.yml`, `test-deployment.yml`, `run-pipeline.yml`, `create-compute-instance.yml`, `create-compute.yml`.
    - If `ado_service_connection_rg` is misconfigured to have subscription-level "Contributor" role, the Azure CLI commands in `inlineScript` will have excessive permissions.
    - The use of `ado_service_connection_rg` implies operations are performed using the permissions associated with this service connection, and its scope is at least Resource Group level.
    - The files themselves do not restrict the permissions of this service connection, making it vulnerable if misconfigured with excessive privileges.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create an Azure DevOps project and organization.
        - Deploy the MLOps templates to this project.
        - Intentionally misconfigure the `ado_service_connection_rg` service connection by granting it "Contributor" role at the subscription level instead of resource group level.
        - Create a pipeline using `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-deployment.yml`.
    2. **Execution**:
        - Run the pipeline. Observe that the deployment is created successfully (as expected).
        - Now, manually try to use the same service connection (or the underlying service principal) to perform an action outside the intended resource group, for example, delete a resource group in a different subscription or resource group.
        - If the service connection is indeed overly permissive, the unauthorized action will succeed.
        - Create or modify an Azure DevOps pipeline to include an Azure CLI task that attempts to delete an unrelated resource in the same Resource Group using `ado_service_connection_rg`. For example:
           ```yaml
           steps:
             - task: AzureCLI@2
               displayName: 'Attempt to Delete Unrelated Resource'
               inputs:
                 azureSubscription: $(ado_service_connection_rg)
                 scriptType: bash
                 scriptLocation: inlineScript
                 inlineScript: |
                   az resource delete --resource-group $(resource_group) --name unrelated-resource --resource-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts --api-version 2021-04-01
           ```
           Replace `unrelated-resource` and `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` with actual resource details present in the Resource Group but not part of the MLOps stack.
    3. **Expected Result**:
        - The test should demonstrate that with a misconfigured service connection, it is possible to perform actions on Azure resources beyond the intended scope, proving the vulnerability.
        - Run the modified pipeline. If the unrelated resource is successfully deleted, it confirms that the `ado_service_connection_rg` has overly permissive permissions, allowing actions beyond the intended scope of MLOps deployment and management.

#### 3. Potential Command Injection in Azure CLI Scripts
  - Description:
    1. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into parameters used within Azure CLI scripts.
    2. For example, in `create-deployment.yml`, the `deployment_name` parameter is directly incorporated into the `az ml $(endpoint_type)-deployment create --name ${{ parameters.deployment_name }} ...` command.
    3. If `parameters.deployment_name` is derived from an external, untrusted source and not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject additional commands.
    4. Although the provided files don't directly show user-controlled input, in a real-world scenario, these parameters might be dynamically generated or passed from external systems, opening up this potential attack vector.
  - Impact:
    - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Azure CLI commands with the permissions of the Azure DevOps service connection.
    - This could lead to unauthorized access to Azure resources, data exfiltration, resource modification, or even complete compromise of the MLOps environment.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None evident in the provided files. The templates assume trusted input for parameters.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for all parameters used in Azure CLI scripts, especially those that could be derived from external sources.
    - Principle of least privilege for Azure DevOps service connections. Grant only the necessary permissions required for each task.
  - Preconditions:
    - A scenario where parameters used in Azure CLI scripts are derived from external, untrusted sources.
    - Lack of input validation and sanitization in the scripts.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Files like `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-deployment.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/allocate-traffic.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/register-data.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-endpoint.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/create-compute.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/register-environment.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/test-deployment.yml`, `/code/templates/aml-cli-v2/run-pipeline.yml` and many other files within `/code/templates` use `AzureCLI@2` task with `inlineScript`.
    - Parameters like `deployment_name`, `traffic_allocation`, `data_name`, `endpoint_name`, `cluster_name`, `environment_name`, `pipeline_file`, etc. are directly embedded into the `inlineScript` using `${{ parameters.<parameter_name> }}` syntax.
    - If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being passed to the Azure DevOps pipeline, and if their values are derived from untrusted sources, command injection is possible.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Deploy the MLOps environment using the provided templates. Assume a scenario where the `deployment_name` parameter in `create-deployment.yml` is controllable by an attacker (e.g., through a web interface or API that triggers the pipeline).
    2. Attack: As an attacker, provide a malicious `deployment_name` parameter value like: `test-deployment; az account show > injected_output.txt`.  This attempts to inject the command `az account show > injected_output.txt` after the intended `az ml ... deployment create ...` command. The output of `az account show` which contains sensitive account information will be redirected to `injected_output.txt`.
    3. Execution: Trigger the Azure DevOps pipeline with the malicious `deployment_name`.
    4. Verification: After the pipeline execution, check the logs of the `Create deployment` task in the Azure DevOps pipeline. Look for execution of the injected command (`az account show > injected_output.txt`).  Also, attempt to access `injected_output.txt` in the workspace's storage account (if accessible) or look for side effects of the injected command. If `az account show` was executed successfully, it proves command injection vulnerability.

#### 4. Insecure Storage of Terraform State
  - Description:
    1. The `templates/infra` directory contains files for deploying infrastructure using Terraform.
    2. `run-terraform-init.yml` configures Terraform to use an Azure Storage Account as the backend for storing Terraform state.
    3. If the configured Storage Account or Container is not properly secured, the Terraform state file could be exposed.
    4. Terraform state files can contain sensitive information, including:
        - Secrets and credentials embedded in Terraform configurations.
        - Configuration details of Azure resources, including network configurations, storage account keys (potentially if managed by Terraform, although best practice is to avoid this), and other sensitive settings.
        - Metadata about the infrastructure, which can aid attackers in reconnaissance.
    5. Exposure of Terraform state could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the infrastructure, understand its configuration for further attacks, or potentially modify the infrastructure.
  - Impact:
    - Information disclosure of sensitive infrastructure configuration details and potentially secrets.
    - Unauthorized access to and modification of the Azure infrastructure managed by Terraform.
    - Increased attack surface and easier reconnaissance for attackers.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: Partially mitigated by using Azure Storage Account as a backend, which is generally more secure than local state.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Private Storage Account:** Ensure the Storage Account used for Terraform state is private and not publicly accessible.
    - **Access Control:** Implement strict access control on the Storage Account and Container. Use Azure RBAC to grant access only to authorized users and service principals.  Specifically, the service principal used by Terraform should have minimal necessary permissions (ideally, a custom role).
    - **Encryption:** While Azure Storage is encrypted at rest by default, verify that encryption is enabled and consider using customer-managed keys for enhanced control.
    - **Network Security:** Consider restricting network access to the Storage Account to only allow access from trusted networks (e.g., Azure DevOps agents' IP ranges or specific virtual networks).
    - **State File Secrets Management:** Best practice is to avoid storing secrets directly in Terraform state. Utilize secure secret management solutions (like Azure Key Vault) and reference secrets in Terraform configurations instead of hardcoding them.
  - Preconditions:
    - Terraform state backend is configured to use an Azure Storage Account (which is the case in the provided templates).
    - The Storage Account or Container used for Terraform state is misconfigured with overly permissive access controls (e.g., public access or broad RBAC roles).
    - An attacker gains access to the Storage Account or Container, either through compromised credentials, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities in Azure Storage.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - `templates/infra/run-terraform-init.yml` configures Terraform backend using Azure Storage Account.
    - Inputs: `backendAzureRmResourceGroupName`, `backendAzureRmStorageAccountName`, `backendAzureRmContainerName`, `backendAzureRmKey`.
    - `create-storage-account.yml` creates the storage account for Terraform state, but there is no explicit configuration of access control or network security in these templates.
    - The templates focus on functionality but lack explicit security hardening for the Terraform state storage.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Deploy the MLOps environment, including the Terraform infrastructure components. Misconfigure the Storage Account used for Terraform state by setting the Container's access level to "Public read access for blobs". (This is a deliberate misconfiguration for testing purposes; in a real-world scenario, public access should be avoided).
    2. Attack: As an external attacker, attempt to anonymously access the Terraform state file in the Storage Account Container. Construct the URL to access the blob directly using the Storage Account name, Container name, and state file key (which might be predictable or discoverable).
       - URL format: `https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<terraform_st_key>`
    3. Execution: Use a web browser or `curl` to access the constructed URL.
    4. Verification: If the Terraform state file is successfully downloaded without authentication, it confirms that the Storage Account Container is publicly accessible and insecurely configured. Examine the downloaded state file (`terraform.tfstate`) for sensitive information. If sensitive data (secrets, configuration details) is found in the state file, it demonstrates the information disclosure vulnerability.
