## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the critical and high severity vulnerabilities identified across the provided lists, after removing duplicates and filtering based on the specified criteria.

### 1. Insecure Authentication Configuration (Authentication Disabled for UI Access)

- **Description:**
    1. The project documentation explicitly instructs users to disable authentication for the deployed web services to access the provided HTML UI page.
    2. This is achieved using the command `kubectl label --overwrite services [service_name] auth.enabled=false`.
    3. Disabling authentication makes the web service publicly accessible without any credentials.
    4. An attacker can access the service URL and interact with the deployed machine learning models via both the UI and the `/score` endpoint without authorization.

- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to the deployed machine learning models.
    - Potential misuse of the models for malicious purposes, such as feeding arbitrary data, leading to unexpected behavior or data leaks.
    - Exposure of internal service details to unauthorized users.
    - Potential resource consumption and impact on service availability due to unauthorized model queries.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - A warning message is present in the `README.md` file: `:warning: **!!! Note that your service will be publicly exposed if you disable authentication !!!** :warning:`. This is purely a documentation warning and does not constitute a technical mitigation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Enforce Authentication by Default:** The service should enforce authentication as the default configuration. Disabling authentication should be strongly discouraged and require explicit configuration with prominent security warnings and justifications.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to granularly control access to different functionalities and endpoints of the service, even if basic authentication is disabled for specific purposes like UI access.
    - **Network Segmentation:** Deploy the service in a private network segment, isolated from direct public internet access, even if authentication is temporarily disabled. This adds a layer of defense-in-depth.
    - **Clear Re-enablement Instructions:** Provide clear and easily discoverable instructions on how to re-enable authentication after UI testing.
    - **Automated Re-enablement Mechanism:** Consider providing scripts or mechanisms to easily re-enable authentication, or even automate re-enablement after a defined testing period.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must follow the documentation and explicitly disable authentication for the deployed service using `kubectl label --overwrite services [service_name] auth.enabled=false`.
    2. The service must be deployed and accessible over the network.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/README.md`**:
        - The `README.md` file contains instructions for disabling authentication for UI testing:
        ```markdown
        :warning: **!!! Note that your service will be publicly exposed if you disable authentication !!!** :warning:

        To disable authentication of your service:

           * Get your deployed service's name:

                 kubectl get services

           * Edit your service's configuration:

                 kubectl label --overwrite services [service_name] auth.enabled=false
        ```
    - **File: `/code/MLeap/airbnb/app.py`, `/code/TimeSeries/solar/app.py`, `/code/Image/inceptionv3/app.py`, `/code/Image/yolov3/app.py`, `/code/Text/deepmoji/app.py`**:
        - Review of all `app.py` files reveals no authentication or authorization logic implemented within the Flask application for the `/score` and `/ui` endpoints.
        - The application directly serves requests to these endpoints without any credential checks.
        - Example from `/code/MLeap/airbnb/app.py`:
        ```python
        @main.route('/ui', methods=['GET'])
        def html_ui():
            resp = flask.send_file('ui.html', add_etags=False)
            resp.headers['Content-Encoding'] = 'identity'
            return resp

        @main.route('/score', methods=['GET'])
        @main.route('/score', methods=['POST'])
        def score_realtime():
            # ... scoring logic ...
        ```
    - **Visualization:**
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[External Attacker] --> B(Public Network);
            B --> C{Azure ML Service (Publicly Exposed)};
            C --> D[/ui Endpoint];
            C --> E[/score Endpoint];
            D -- No Authentication --> F[HTML UI Page];
            E -- No Authentication --> G[ML Model Inference];
            A -- Unauthorized Access --> C;
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy any service (e.g., YOLOv3) following the `README.md` instructions.
    2. Get the service name using `kubectl get services`.
    3. Disable authentication: `kubectl label --overwrite services [service_name] auth.enabled=false`.
    4. Obtain the service URL using `az ml service list realtime` and `az ml service usage realtime -i [full_service_id]`.
    5. Access `your_service_url/ui` in a browser. Verify UI access without login.
    6. Send a scoring request using `curl` to `your_service_url/score` (e.g., using `call.sh` without authentication key).
    7. Verify successful scoring response, demonstrating unauthorized access.


### 2. Verbose Error Handling (Information Disclosure)

- **Description:**
    1. The Flask application's error handlers are configured to return detailed exception tracebacks in the response when errors occur.
    2. `app.py` files use `traceback.format_exc()` in error handlers for various exceptions (e.g., `ServerSideException`, `ClientSideException`, `Exception`).
    3. These tracebacks can expose sensitive server information: file paths, internal state, and potentially dependency versions.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can gain insights into the application's internal workings, aiding in further attacks by revealing file paths, library versions, and code structure.
    - Debugging information intended for developers is exposed to potentially malicious users.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Error handlers are designed to return detailed tracebacks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Generic Error Responses:** Implement error handlers that return generic, user-friendly error messages instead of detailed tracebacks in production environments.
    - **Secure Logging:** Log detailed error information (including tracebacks) securely on the server-side for debugging, but do not expose it in client responses.
    - **Conditional Error Detail:** Provide detailed error responses only in development/debugging modes, and generic errors in production.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. An error must occur during request processing (e.g., invalid input, model errors, server issues).
    2. The attacker must trigger an error and observe the service's response.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/MLeap/airbnb/app.py`, `/code/TimeSeries/solar/app.py`, `/code/Image/inceptionv3/app.py`, `/code/Image/yolov3/app.py`, `/code/Text/deepmoji/app.py`**:
        - All `app.py` files contain similar error handlers, e.g., from `/code/MLeap/airbnb/app.py`:
        ```python
        @main.errorhandler(Exception)
        def unhandled_exception(error):
            main.stop_hooks()
            main.logger.debug("Unhandled exception generated")
            error_message = "Encountered Exception: {0}".format(traceback.format_exc())
            main.logger.error(error_message)
            internal_error = "An unexpected internal error occurred. {0}".format(error_message)
            return AMLResponse(internal_error, 500, json_str=False)
        ```
        - `traceback.format_exc()` captures and includes the full traceback in the response.

    - **Visualization:**
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[External Attacker] --> B(Public Network);
            B --> C{Azure ML Service};
            C -- Error Triggered --> D[Error Handler in app.py];
            D --> E{traceback.format_exc()};
            E --> F[Detailed Traceback in Response];
            F --> B;
            B --> A[Attacker Gains Information];
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy any service (e.g., Inceptionv3).
    2. Send an invalid scoring request to cause an error (e.g., non-image data for Inceptionv3).
    3. Observe the service response.
    4. Verify the response body contains a detailed Python traceback with file paths and potentially sensitive information.
    5. Example using `curl` with invalid image data for InceptionV3:
       ```bash
       curl your_service_url/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"invalid": "input"}'
       ```
    6. Examine the response body and confirm the presence of a full traceback.


### 3. Outdated Dependencies (PyTorch in DeepMoji)

- **Description:**
    1. The DeepMoji service in `/code/Text/deepmoji/` uses an outdated version of PyTorch, version 0.2.0, specified in `/code/Text/deepmoji/conda_dependencies.yml`.
    2. Outdated dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities fixed in later versions.
    3. Vulnerable dependencies can expose the service to potential exploits.

- **Impact:**
    - Increased attack surface due to known vulnerabilities in outdated PyTorch 0.2.0.
    - Potential for various exploits depending on specific vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary code execution, denial of service).

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium (can be High or Critical depending on specific vulnerabilities in PyTorch 0.2.0)

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project explicitly specifies the outdated version in the dependency file.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Dependency Updates:** Update PyTorch to the latest stable version in `/code/Text/deepmoji/conda_dependencies.yml`.
    - **Dependency Scanning:** Implement regular dependency scanning to identify and update vulnerable dependencies proactively.
    - **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for PyTorch and other dependencies used in the project.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The DeepMoji service must be deployed and running.
    2. Attackers must be able to exploit vulnerabilities present in PyTorch 0.2.0. Exploitability depends on the specific vulnerabilities.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/Text/deepmoji/conda_dependencies.yml`**:
        ```yaml
        name: deepmojienv
        channels:
          - defaults
          - soumith
        dependencies:
          - python=3.5.2
          - pytorch=0.2.0
          - torchvision
          - pip:
            - numpy
            - cython
            - pyyaml
            - scikit-learn
            - scipy
            - text-unidecode
            - emoji
        ```
        - `- pytorch=0.2.0` indicates the use of PyTorch version 0.2.0, which is significantly outdated.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the DeepMoji service.
    2. Identify the installed PyTorch version in the deployed environment (e.g., by printing `torch.__version__` in `score.py` and checking logs).
    3. Verify that the installed PyTorch version is 0.2.0 or within the 0.2.x range.
    4. Search for CVEs associated with PyTorch version 0.2.0 in public vulnerability databases (NIST NVD, Mitre CVE).
    5. Assess the severity and exploitability of found CVEs in the context of the deployed service. Demonstrating the presence of the outdated dependency is sufficient evidence of the vulnerability.
