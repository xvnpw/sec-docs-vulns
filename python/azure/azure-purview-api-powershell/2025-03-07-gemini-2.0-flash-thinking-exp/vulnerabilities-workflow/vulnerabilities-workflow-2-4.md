- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated PurviewAPIDirectURL leading to potential request manipulation
- Description:
    1. The PowerShell script `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` (described in README.md, but not provided in the project files) allows users to interact with the Azure Purview REST API in Batch Mode using the `-APIDirect` and `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameters.
    2. The `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter takes a full URL as input, which is intended to be the endpoint of the Azure Purview REST API.
    3. If the PowerShell script does not validate or sanitize the `PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter, an attacker can inject a malicious URL.
    4. By providing a manipulated URL, an attacker could redirect API requests to an unintended domain or path, potentially bypassing security controls or accessing unauthorized resources.
    5. For example, an attacker could replace the legitimate Purview domain with a malicious domain under their control, potentially leading to information disclosure if sensitive data is sent to the attacker's server, or to phishing attacks if the attacker spoofs a Purview login page.
- Impact:
    - Potential redirection of API requests to malicious servers.
    - Information disclosure if API requests containing sensitive data are sent to an attacker-controlled server.
    - Phishing attacks if the attacker spoofs a Purview login page or other sensitive content.
    - Unauthorized actions if the attacker can manipulate the API path to access unintended functionalities (less likely but possible depending on script implementation).
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided documentation or files. The README.md usage examples directly take the `PurviewAPIDirectURL` as user input without mentioning any validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter within the PowerShell script.
    - URL parsing and reconstruction to ensure that the provided URL is indeed pointing to the intended Azure Purview domain and API path.
    - Whitelisting of allowed domains or URL prefixes to restrict the possible values of `PurviewAPIDirectURL`.
    - Instead of accepting a full URL, the script could be redesigned to accept only the API path and construct the full URL internally based on the Purview account name, reducing the attack surface.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script in Batch Mode.
    - The attacker must be able to provide input to the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter when running the script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **PowerShell script `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` source code is not provided.** Therefore, the analysis is based on the description in `README.md` and the assumed script behavior.
    - The `README.md` file shows examples of using `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` directly with user-provided URLs:
      ```PowerShell
      PS >>   Purview-API-PowerShell     -APIDirect    -HTTPMethod GET      -PurviewAPIDirectURL "https://{your-purview-account-name}.purview.azure.com/catalog/api/atlas/v2/types/typedefs?api-version=2021-07-01"
      ```
    - Based on this usage, it is assumed that the script takes the string provided to `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` and uses it directly in constructing the HTTP request without further validation.
    - **Vulnerable Code Flow (Hypothetical):**
        1. Script reads the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter value provided by the user.
        2. Script constructs an HTTP request using the provided URL for the target endpoint.
        3. Script sends the HTTP request to the URL.
    - **Attack Scenario Visualization (Hypothetical):**
        ```
        Attacker Input (PurviewAPIDirectURL): "https://malicious.example.com/api/data"
        PowerShell Script:
            $api_url = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter PurviewAPIDirectURL" # In reality, it's parameter input
            $uri = New-Object System.Uri($api_url) # Potentially no validation here, or insufficient.
            Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET # Request sent to attacker's URL
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prerequisites:
        - Access to a system where `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script can be executed (script is not provided, test needs to be performed if script is available).
        - A network interception proxy (like Burp Suite, Fiddler, or Wireshark) to monitor HTTP requests.
    2. Steps:
        - Execute the `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script in Batch Mode with the `-APIDirect` parameter.
        - For the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter, provide a malicious URL pointing to a server you control or a requestbin service (e.g., `https://example.requestbin.com/api/test`). Replace `example.requestbin.com/api/test` with a valid requestbin URL or your controlled server URL.
        - Set `-HTTPMethod GET`.
        - Run the script with necessary Purview account parameters (like `-PurviewAccountName`, if required even in `-APIDirect` mode, based on script implementation).
        - Observe the HTTP requests captured by the network interception proxy.
    3. Expected Result:
        - If the script is vulnerable, you should observe an HTTP GET request being sent to the malicious URL (`https://example.requestbin.com/api/test` or your controlled server) instead of the intended Purview API endpoint.
        - The request should contain details that would normally be sent to the Purview API (like headers or potentially authentication tokens if they are included in the URL or handled by the script for any URL).
    4. Pass/Fail:
        - Fail: If the HTTP request is successfully sent to the malicious URL, confirming that the `PurviewAPIDirectURL` is not properly validated and is used directly for making API requests.
        - Pass: If the script prevents the request from being sent to the malicious URL, either by validating the URL or by failing to process the malicious URL in some way (though this is less likely given the vulnerability description).
