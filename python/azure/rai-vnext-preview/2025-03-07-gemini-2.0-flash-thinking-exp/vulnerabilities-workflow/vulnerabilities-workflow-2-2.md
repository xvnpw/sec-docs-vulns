- Vulnerability Name: Data Input Manipulation - Lack of Input Validation
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious dataset designed to skew the analysis results of the Responsible AI dashboard. This could involve manipulating feature distributions, introducing deliberate biases, or altering target variable values.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious dataset as input to the Responsible AI dashboard, either through the Python SDK, CLI, or Azure Machine Learning studio UI.
    3. The Responsible AI dashboard processes this malicious dataset without proper input validation or sanitization.
    4. As a result, the dashboard generates skewed and misleading insights into the model's fairness, explainability, and error analysis, reflecting the manipulations introduced in the malicious dataset.
    5. The user, relying on these skewed insights, may be misled into believing their model is robust and unbiased, and proceed to deploy a flawed or biased model into production.
- Impact:
    - Skewed and misleading insights in the Responsible AI dashboard.
    - Users may be unaware of biases or flaws in their machine learning models.
    - Potential deployment of flawed or biased models into production, leading to unfair or unethical outcomes.
    - Reputational damage and legal liabilities for the user or organization deploying the flawed model.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project files do not contain any input validation or sanitization mechanisms for user-provided datasets.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all datasets provided to the Responsible AI dashboard.
        - Validate data types and formats.
        - Check for data integrity and consistency.
        - Detect and flag potential data biases or anomalies.
        - Consider providing warnings to users about potential data quality issues.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to provide a dataset as input to the Responsible AI dashboard. This is generally the case for users interacting with the dashboard through the SDK, CLI, or UI.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/responsibleai/rai_analyse/create_rai_insights.py**
        - This script is the entry point for creating RAI Insights. It uses the `load_dataset` function to load both training and test datasets provided as input.
        - ```python
          train_df = load_dataset(args.train_dataset)
          test_df = load_dataset(args.test_dataset)
          ```
    2. **File: /code/src/responsibleai/rai_analyse/rai_component_utilities.py**
        - The `load_dataset` function attempts to load the dataset from a given path, supporting both MLTable and Parquet formats.
        - ```python
          def load_dataset(dataset_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
              _logger.info(f"Attempting to load: {dataset_path}")
              exceptions = []
              isLoadSuccessful = False

              try:
                  df = load_mltable(dataset_path)
                  isLoadSuccessful = True
              except Exception as e:
                  new_e = UserConfigError(...)
                  exceptions.append(new_e)

              if not isLoadSuccessful:
                  try:
                      df = load_parquet(dataset_path)
                      isLoadSuccessful = True
                  except Exception as e:
                      new_e = UserConfigError(...)
                      exceptions.append(new_e)

              if not isLoadSuccessful:
                  raise UserConfigError(...)
              return df
          ```
        - The `load_dataset` function focuses on loading the data in different formats but lacks any data validation or sanitization steps after the data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
        - The loaded DataFrame is directly used for RAI insights computation without any checks for data quality, biases, or malicious content.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
        A[create_rai_insights.py] --> B(load_dataset);
        B --> C[rai_component_utilities.py];
        C --> D{mltable.load / pd.read_parquet};
        D --> E[Pandas DataFrame];
        E --> F[RAI Insights Computation];
        style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        ```
        - The visualization shows the data flow. The data loading process (node D & E) directly feeds into the RAI Insights computation (node F) without any validation step in between.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Have an Azure Machine Learning workspace set up and the Responsible AI dashboard components deployed.
        - Train and register a classification model (e.g., using the 'adult' dataset and 'train_logistic_regression_for_rai' component).
    2. **Step 1: Prepare a Benign Dataset:**
        - Use a standard, benign test dataset (e.g., a copy of the 'adult_test' dataset).
    3. **Step 2: Prepare a Malicious Dataset:**
        - Create a copy of the benign test dataset.
        - Introduce a significant skew in a numerical feature, for example, the 'Age' column. Replace 90% of 'Age' values with '1'.
        - Introduce bias in a categorical feature, for example, in the 'Race' column, overwhelmingly favor one race category.
    4. **Step 3: Create RAI Dashboard using SDK with Benign Dataset:**
        - Use the Python SDK to create a Responsible AI dashboard for the registered model, using the *benign* test dataset.
        - Run the pipeline to generate the dashboard.
        - Note the insights generated for the benign dataset as a baseline.
    5. **Step 4: Create RAI Dashboard using SDK with Malicious Dataset:**
        - Use the Python SDK to create *another* Responsible AI dashboard for the *same* registered model, but this time using the *malicious* test dataset.
        - Run the pipeline.
    6. **Step 5: Compare Dashboards in Azure ML Studio:**
        - Access both dashboards in the Azure ML studio UI (under the 'Models' section, 'Responsible AI dashboard (preview)' tab).
        - Compare the insights generated by both dashboards, particularly focusing on:
            - **Error Analysis:** Check if the error tree and heatmap reflect the data manipulation in the malicious dataset. Are error cohorts skewed towards the manipulated features?
            - **Data Explorer:** Examine the feature distributions for the manipulated features in both dashboards. Does the malicious dataset show the intended skewed distribution?
            - **Model Statistics:** Compare the overall model performance metrics. Are they significantly different between the benign and malicious dataset dashboards?
        - **Expected Result:**
            - The dashboard generated with the malicious dataset should display skewed and misleading insights compared to the baseline dashboard.
            - Error analysis should be influenced by the manipulated features, potentially highlighting spurious error cohorts.
            - Data Explorer should clearly visualize the skewed distributions of the manipulated features.
            - Model statistics might show unexpected changes due to the altered dataset, but these changes might not be correctly attributed to data manipulation without proper validation.
        - **Success Condition:** If the dashboard with the malicious dataset presents demonstrably skewed and misleading insights, the vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates a lack of input validation, allowing attackers to manipulate the dashboard's analysis through crafted datasets.
