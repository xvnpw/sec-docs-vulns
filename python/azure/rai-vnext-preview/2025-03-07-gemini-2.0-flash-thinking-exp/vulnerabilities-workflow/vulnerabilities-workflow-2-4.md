- Vulnerability Name: Dataframe Type Confusion Vulnerability in Dataset Loading

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Parquet file.
    2. This Parquet file is designed to exploit type confusion vulnerabilities when loaded by pandas. For example, a column intended to be numerical could be crafted to be interpreted as a string or categorical type under certain conditions.
    3. The user uploads this crafted Parquet file to Azure ML workspace as a dataset or provides a link to it.
    4. The user then creates a Responsible AI dashboard analysis job, pointing to this malicious dataset as input (either train or test dataset).
    5. When the `load_dataset` function in `/code/src/responsibleai/rai_analyse/rai_component_utilities.py` loads this Parquet file using pandas, the type confusion occurs.
    6. This type confusion leads to incorrect data processing within the Responsible AI components. For example, numerical features may be treated as categorical, or vice versa.
    7. Consequently, the Responsible AI dashboard generates misleading insights based on the misinterpreted data, without throwing explicit errors.
    8. The user, relying on these misleading insights, may unknowingly deploy a flawed model, believing it to be properly analyzed by the dashboard.

- Impact:
    - Users are presented with inaccurate or misleading Responsible AI insights.
    - Users may develop a false sense of security about their ML models, believing them to be fair, explainable, and error-free based on the dashboard's analysis.
    - This can lead to the deployment of flawed or biased models into production, potentially causing harm or unfair outcomes in real-world applications.
    - The credibility and trustworthiness of the Responsible AI Dashboard are undermined.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code files that specifically prevent dataframe type confusion during dataset loading.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strict input validation and sanitization:** Implement rigorous checks on the data types and formats of the loaded datasets, especially Parquet files. This should include verifying that column types match expected schemas and handling potential type ambiguities or inconsistencies.
    - **Schema enforcement:** Define and enforce a strict schema for input datasets. Ensure that the data loaded conforms to this schema, raising errors if discrepancies are found.
    - **Type casting and verification:** Explicitly cast dataframe columns to the expected types after loading and verify that the casting was successful and data integrity is maintained.
    - **Security warnings:** Display warnings to users about the risks of using untrusted or externally sourced datasets and models, encouraging them to use datasets from trusted sources.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Parquet file.
    - The user must use this malicious Parquet file as input to the Responsible AI Dashboard analysis job.
    - The Azure ML workspace needs to be set up and the Responsible AI Dashboard components registered.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/responsibleai/rai_analyse/rai_component_utilities.py`
    2. **Function:** `load_parquet(parquet_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def load_parquet(parquet_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        _logger.info(f"Attempting to load {parquet_path} as parquet dataset")
        try:
            df = pd.read_parquet(parquet_path) # Vulnerable line
        except Exception as e:
            _logger.info(f"Failed to load {parquet_path} as MLTable. ")
            raise e
        return df
    ```
    4. **Analysis:**
        - The `load_parquet` function directly uses `pd.read_parquet(parquet_path)` to load Parquet files.
        - `pd.read_parquet` relies on pandas' Parquet parsing capabilities, which, while robust, might be susceptible to type confusion if a malicious file is crafted to exploit pandas' type inference or handling of complex Parquet structures.
        - There is no explicit schema validation or type checking after loading the Parquet file.
        - If a malicious Parquet file is crafted to cause pandas to misinterpret column types, this could lead to downstream components processing data with incorrect assumptions about its type.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create an Azure ML Workspace and register Responsible AI components.
        - Prepare a benign dataset (e.g., Boston Housing dataset).
        - Train and register a simple model (e.g., linear regression on Boston Housing dataset).
    2. **Craft Malicious Parquet File:**
        - Create a Parquet file based on the Boston Housing dataset schema.
        - In the malicious Parquet file, modify the metadata or data encoding of a numerical column (e.g., 'RM' - average number of rooms per dwelling) to potentially cause pandas to misinterpret its type as categorical or string when loaded. This might involve manipulating the Parquet schema metadata or encoding specific values in a way that triggers pandas type inference issues.
    3. **Upload Malicious Dataset:**
        - Upload the crafted malicious Parquet file to the Azure ML workspace as a dataset (e.g., `boston_malicious_pq`).
    4. **Run RAI Pipeline with Malicious Dataset:**
        - Create a pipeline YAML file (similar to `test/rai/pipeline_boston_analyse.yaml`), but modify it to use the malicious dataset (`boston_malicious_pq`) instead of the benign `boston_test_pq` for the `test_dataset` input of the `rai_insights_constructor` component. Ensure the pipeline includes Error Analysis or other components that would be sensitive to data type errors.
    5. **Submit and Monitor Pipeline:**
        - Submit the modified pipeline job to Azure ML.
        - Monitor the pipeline run and its outputs in Azure ML studio.
    6. **Analyze Results:**
        - Check the generated Responsible AI dashboard in Azure ML studio.
        - Analyze the Error Analysis results, explanations, or other insights generated by the dashboard.
        - **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Valid):**
            - Observe that the dashboard generates misleading insights, for example, Error Analysis might show unexpected error distributions or feature importance values for the 'RM' feature due to its misinterpreted data type.
            - Verify that no explicit errors or crashes occurred during the pipeline execution, indicating silent data corruption and misleading insight generation.
        - **Expected Outcome (Mitigation Present/Vulnerability Invalid):**
            - Observe that the pipeline job fails with a data validation error, or the dashboard displays warnings about data type inconsistencies.
            - Or, if mitigations are effective, the dashboard generates insights based on the *correct* interpretation of data, even with the malicious Parquet file, indicating that type confusion was prevented.

This test case aims to demonstrate that a crafted Parquet file can indeed lead to type confusion during dataset loading and consequently result in misleading Responsible AI insights, validating the vulnerability.
