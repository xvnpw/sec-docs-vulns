### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in vCenter connection parameters
  - **Description:**
    1. The script reads vCenter connection details (FQDN, port, username) from a user-provided configuration file.
    2. In the `_connect_vcenter` function within `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/pkgs/_arcvmware_resources.py`, these configuration values (`vCenterFQDN`, `vCenterPort`, `vCenterUserName`) are directly incorporated into an `az cli connectedvmware vcenter connect` command.
    3. The script then executes this command using `az_cli`, which uses `subprocess.check_output`.
    4. Due to the lack of input sanitization for `vCenterFQDN`, `vCenterPort`, and `vCenterUserName`, an attacker who can control the configuration file can inject arbitrary commands into these parameters.
    5. When the script executes the command, the injected commands will be executed by the system.

  - **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the script with the privileges of the user executing the script.
    - This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
      - Full system compromise.
      - Unauthorized data access and exfiltration.
      - Modification or deletion of critical system files.
      - Denial of Service.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The script uses the `safe_escape_characters` function to escape the `vCenterPassword` parameter before including it in the `az cli` command.
    - However, this mitigation is not applied to `vCenterFQDN`, `vCenterPort`, and `vCenterUserName` parameters, leaving them vulnerable to command injection.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for `vCenterFQDN`, `vCenterPort`, and `vCenterUserName` obtained from the configuration file. This should include checks for disallowed characters and patterns that could be used for command injection.
    - **Parameterized Commands:** Utilize parameterized commands or secure command construction methods provided by the `az cli` SDK (if available) to prevent command injection. This would involve separating the command structure from the user-supplied data.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the script and the user running it operate with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful command injection attack.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to provide or modify the configuration file used by the script. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
      - Social engineering to trick a user into using a malicious configuration file.
      - Compromising a system or process that generates or stores the configuration file.
      - Man-in-the-middle attacks if the configuration file is transmitted over an insecure channel.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/pkgs/_arcvmware_resources.py`
    - **Function:** `_connect_vcenter`
    - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
      ```python
      res, err = az_cli('connectedvmware', 'vcenter', 'connect',
          '--resource-group', f'"{rg}"',
          '--name', f'"{name}"',
          '--location', f'"{location}"',
          '--custom-location', f'"{custom_location_id}"',
          '--fqdn', f'"{fqdn}"',  # Vulnerable: User-controlled value, not sanitized
          '--port', f'"{port}"',  # Vulnerable: User-controlled value, not sanitized
          '--username', f'"{username}"', # Vulnerable: User-controlled value, not sanitized
          '--password="{}"'.format(safe_escape_characters(password)) # Partially mitigated: Password is escaped
      )
      ```
    - The `fqdn`, `port`, and `username` variables are directly sourced from the `config` dictionary, which is populated by parsing a user-provided JSON configuration file. These variables are then directly embedded into the shell command string passed to `az_cli` without any sanitization to prevent command injection.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Configuration File Creation:** Create a JSON configuration file named `malicious_config.json` with the following content. This payload attempts to execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command.
       ```json
       {
         "vCenterFQDN": "$(touch /tmp/pwned)",
         "vCenterPort": "443",
         "vCenterUserName": "testuser",
         "vCenterPassword": "testpassword",
         "resourceGroup": "your-resource-group",
         "nameForVCenterInAzure": "malicious-vcenter",
         "location": "westus2",
         "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
         "customLocationAzureName": "test-custom-location",
         "nameForApplianceInAzure": "test-appliance",
         "isAVS": true,
         "register": true,
         "isStatic": true,
         "staticIpNetworkDetails": {
           "networkForApplianceVM": "test-segment",
           "networkCIDRForApplianceVM": "192.168.10.0/28"
         },
         "privateCloud": "your-private-cloud"
       }
       ```
       **Note:** Replace `"your-resource-group"`, `"your-subscription-id"`, and `"your-private-cloud"` with valid Azure details if you intend to run this test in a real environment.
    2. **Script Execution with Malicious Configuration:** Execute the `run.sh` script, providing the `onboard` operation and the path to the `malicious_config.json` file as arguments:
       ```bash
       ./code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/run.sh onboard malicious_config.json
       ```
    3. **Verification of Command Injection:** After the script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned
       ```
       - **Successful Injection:** If the `ls /tmp/pwned` command shows that the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful. The `$(touch /tmp/pwned)` part in the `vCenterFQDN` field was executed as part of the `az cli connectedvmware vcenter connect` command.
       - **Failed Injection:** If the file `/tmp/pwned` does not exist, further investigation might be needed, but it could indicate that the command injection was not successful in this specific scenario. However, it's crucial to note that even if this specific test fails, other injection vectors or environments might still be vulnerable.

       **Important Security Note:** Perform this test in a controlled, non-production environment as it involves executing arbitrary commands. Ensure you understand the risks before running this test.
