### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection in vCenter Operations via govc CLI

* Description:
    1. The application takes user-provided configuration in JSON format, including parameters for vCenter operations like creating folders and resource pools.
    2. Specifically, the `folderForApplianceVM` and `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` parameters from the configuration are used as folder and resource pool names respectively.
    3. These names are directly passed as arguments to the `govc_cli` function in `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/pkgs/_govc_cli.py`.
    4. The `govc_cli` function executes these arguments in a shell using `subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)`.
    5. If an attacker can manipulate the configuration file to include malicious commands within the `folderForApplianceVM` or `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` parameters, they can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the system running the script with the privileges of the script user.

* Impact:
    - **High**. Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system hosting the appliance onboarding script.
    - This could lead to:
        - Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
        - Modification or deletion of critical system files.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Complete compromise of the system.
    - The impact is high because the script is designed to manage infrastructure components, and compromising the script execution environment can have significant consequences on the managed infrastructure.

* Vulnerability Rank: **High**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly passes the folder and resource pool names to the shell without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `folderForApplianceVM` and `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` inputs to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before passing them to `govc_cli`. A whitelist approach for allowed characters in folder and resource pool names would be more secure than a blacklist.
    - **Parameterization:** If possible, use a `govc` library or API that supports parameterized commands instead of constructing shell commands from strings. This would avoid shell injection vulnerabilities altogether.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the format and content of the `folderForApplianceVM` and `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` parameters to ensure they conform to expected naming conventions and do not contain unexpected or malicious characters.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the configuration file that is provided as input to the `run.py` script (specified by the second command line argument).
    - The script must be executed by a user with sufficient privileges for command injection to be meaningful (e.g., a user that can interact with the vCenter and the underlying system).

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/pkgs/_govc_cli.py`**
        ```python
        def govc_cli(*args):
            create_dir_if_doesnot_exist(_govc_binary_dir)
            with TempChangeDir(_govc_binary_dir):
                args = ' '.join(args) # [!] Arguments are joined with space and used in shell=True
                res = None
                try:
                    cmd = os.path.join('.', 'govc')
                    cmd = cmd + ' ' + args # [!] User controlled 'args' is concatenated to form command
                    try:
                        res = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True) # [!] shell=True is used, making it vulnerable
        ```
        - The `govc_cli` function takes `*args`, joins them with spaces, and then executes them using `subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)`. The `shell=True` argument is the primary reason for command injection vulnerability as it allows shell interpretation of the command string.

    2. **File: `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/pkgs/_vmware_env_setup.py`**
        ```python
        class VMwareEnvSetup(object):
            ...
            def _create_folder(self):
                logging.info("in _create_folder")
                folder = self._config['folderForApplianceVM'] # [!] User controlled folder name from config
                datacenter = self._config['datacenterForApplianceVM']
                if self._folder_exists(folder):
                    logging.info("folder already exists")
                    return
                _, err = govc_cli('folder.create', folder) # [!] Folder name passed to govc_cli
                if err:
                    raise vCenterOperationFailed('Folder creation failed.')
                logging.info("folder created successfully")
                return
            ...
            def _create_resource_pool(self):
                logging.info("in _create_resource_pool")
                resource_pool = self._config['resourcePoolForApplianceVM'] # [!] User controlled resource pool name from config
                datacenter = self._config['datacenterForApplianceVM']
                if self._resource_pool_exists(resource_pool):
                    logging.info("resource pool already exists")
                    return
                _, err = govc_cli('pool.create', resource_pool) # [!] Resource pool name passed to govc_cli
                if err:
                    raise vCenterOperationFailed('Resource Pool creation failed.')
                logging.info("resource pool created successfully")
                return
        ```
        - The `_create_folder` and `_create_resource_pool` methods in `VMwareEnvSetup` class retrieve `folderForApplianceVM` and `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` from `self._config` and directly pass them to the `govc_cli` function as arguments.

    3. **File: `/code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/appliance_setup/run.py`**
        ```python
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            ...
            file_path = None
            try:
                file_path = sys.argv[2] # [!] Config file path from command line argument
            except IndexError:
                raise FilePathNotFoundInArgs('Config file path is not given in command line arguments.')
            config = None
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                data = f.read()
                config = json.loads(data) # [!] Config is loaded from user provided file
            ...
            env_setup = VMwareEnvSetup(config) # [!] Config is passed to VMwareEnvSetup
            env_setup.setup() # [!] setup method calls _create_folder and _create_resource_pool
        ```
        - The `run.py` script reads the configuration from a file specified by a command-line argument and passes it to `VMwareEnvSetup`, thus user-controlled input from the configuration file flows into the vulnerable `govc_cli` calls.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious JSON configuration file (e.g., `malicious_config.json`) with the following content to test folder creation command injection:
        ```json
        {
          "isAVS": true,
          "register": true,
          "isStatic": true,
          "location": "westus2",
          "subscriptionId": "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID",
          "resourceGroup": "YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP",
          "privateCloud": "YOUR_PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME",
          "vCenterFQDN": "YOUR_VCENTER_FQDN",
          "vCenterPort": "443",
          "vCenterUserName": "YOUR_VCENTER_USERNAME",
          "vCenterPassword": "YOUR_VCENTER_PASSWORD",
          "datacenterForApplianceVM": "YOUR_DATACENTER",
          "datastoreForApplianceVM": "YOUR_DATASTORE",
          "resourcePoolForApplianceVM": "YOUR_RESOURCE_POOL",
          "networkForApplianceVM": "YOUR_NETWORK_SEGMENT",
          "folderForApplianceVM": "test_folder`touch /tmp/pwned`",  // [!] Malicious folder name with command injection
          "vmTemplateName": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_NAME",
          "staticIpNetworkDetails": {
            "networkForApplianceVM": "YOUR_NETWORK_SEGMENT",
            "networkCIDRForApplianceVM": "YOUR_CIDR",
            "gatewayIPAddress": "YOUR_GATEWAY_IP"
          },
          "nameForApplianceInAzure": "test-appliance",
          "customLocationAzureName": "test-custom-location",
          "nameForVCenterInAzure": "test-vcenter"
        }
        ```
        **Note:** Replace placeholders like `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `YOUR_PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME`, `YOUR_VCENTER_FQDN`, `YOUR_VCENTER_USERNAME`, `YOUR_VCENTER_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_DATACENTER`, `YOUR_DATASTORE`, `YOUR_RESOURCE_POOL`, `YOUR_NETWORK_SEGMENT`, `YOUR_TEMPLATE_NAME`, `YOUR_CIDR`, `YOUR_GATEWAY_IP` with valid values for your vCenter and Azure environment.

    2. Execute the `run.sh` script with the malicious configuration file:
        ```bash
        ./code/src/appliance-onboarding-script/run.sh onboard malicious_config.json INFO false
        ```

    3. After the script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system where the script was executed.
        ```bash
        ls -l /tmp/pwned
        ```
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, and the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was executed by the shell.
    4. Similarly, you can test command injection via `resourcePoolForApplianceVM` parameter by modifying the malicious configuration file accordingly and repeating steps 2 and 3.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker who can control the configuration file can achieve command injection through the `folderForApplianceVM` parameter, proving the vulnerability.
