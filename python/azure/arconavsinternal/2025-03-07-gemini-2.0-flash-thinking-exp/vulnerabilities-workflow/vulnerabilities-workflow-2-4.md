- Vulnerability name: Social Engineering Risk due to Project Name
- Description:
    - An attacker identifies the public GitHub repository named "arconavsinternal".
    - The name "arconavsinternal" strongly suggests that this project is internal to Azure and related to Arc and VMware technologies.
    - The attacker crafts a social engineering or phishing email targeting Azure employees.
    - In the email, the attacker prominently mentions the project name "arconavsinternal" to falsely imply inside knowledge, affiliation, or legitimate access to internal Azure resources and projects.
    - The attacker might then request sensitive information from the employee, such as credentials, access to internal systems, or induce them to perform actions that could compromise security. The attacker leverages the perceived legitimacy gained from mentioning what appears to be an internal project.
    - An Azure employee, believing the attacker is also an internal employee or has a valid reason to be aware of "arconavsinternal", may be more inclined to trust the attacker and comply with their malicious requests, increasing the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to internal Azure systems and resources.
    - Potential disclosure of sensitive internal Azure information.
    - Compromise of Azure employee accounts, leading to further internal breaches.
- Vulnerability rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project name and its public visibility on GitHub inherently present this risk.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Rename the repository to a less descriptive and less suggestive name that does not imply internal Azure project affiliation. A generic or obfuscated name would reduce the social engineering attack surface.
    - If the project is genuinely intended for internal Azure use only, consider making the repository private to limit external visibility of the project name.
    - Implement and reinforce security awareness training programs for Azure employees, specifically highlighting the risk of social engineering attacks that may leverage information from publicly available sources like GitHub, including project names that sound internal.
- Preconditions:
    - The project repository "arconavsinternal" is publicly accessible on GitHub, making the project name visible to potential attackers.
    - Attackers possess knowledge of or can infer Azure internal project naming conventions, allowing them to recognize "arconavsinternal" as potentially internal.
    - Attackers actively target Azure employees with social engineering or phishing campaigns.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not located within the source code itself. It arises from the project's chosen name and its public exposure, which can be exploited for social engineering purposes.
    - No specific source code analysis is applicable as this is a matter of project naming and access control, rather than a code-level flaw.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: As an external security tester, identify the publicly accessible GitHub repository with the name "arconavsinternal".
    - Step 2: Craft a realistic phishing email specifically targeting an Azure employee.
    - Step 3: Within the phishing email's content, deliberately and prominently mention the project name "arconavsinternal". Frame the mention in a context that suggests the attacker is also an insider, has legitimate reasons to know about the project, or is collaborating on it.
    - Step 4: In the phishing email, attempt to elicit sensitive information or induce a specific action from the employee, such as requesting login credentials, access codes, or asking them to visit a malicious link under the guise of project-related necessity.
    - Step 5: Analyze the Azure employee's response. Assess whether the mention of "arconavsinternal" in the phishing email increased the employee's trust and willingness to comply with the attacker's requests, compared to a generic phishing attempt without such project-specific details. A higher compliance rate or increased trust level would validate the social engineering risk associated with the project name.
