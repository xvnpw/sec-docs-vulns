## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities after reviewing the provided lists. Duplicate vulnerabilities have been consolidated, and the list excludes vulnerabilities that are out of scope based on the given criteria.

### 1. Insecure Storage of Device Authentication Credentials in Environment Variables

- **Description:**
    - The Azure IoT Device SDK for Python, by default, reads device authentication credentials, such as connection strings, symmetric keys, and x.509 certificate paths, from environment variables.
    - This practice can lead to vulnerabilities if not handled carefully by the user application, as environment variables are often stored in plain text and can be unintentionally exposed or logged.
    - An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the environment where the application is running can easily retrieve these credentials and use them to impersonate the IoT device.
    - **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
        1. A developer creates an IoT application using Azure IoT Device SDK for Python.
        2. The developer follows the documentation or samples, which instruct them to store device credentials (connection string, symmetric key, x.509 certificate paths) in environment variables (e.g. `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `X509_CERT_FILE`, `X509_KEY_FILE`, `PROVISIONING_SYMMETRIC_KEY`).
        3. The application is deployed to an environment (e.g. device, server, cloud instance).
        4. An attacker gains unauthorized access to this environment through some means (e.g. exploiting other vulnerabilities, social engineering, physical access).
        5. The attacker inspects the environment variables and retrieves the device authentication credentials stored in plain text.
        6. The attacker can now use these stolen credentials to impersonate the IoT device and perform malicious actions, such as sending fabricated telemetry data or controlling the device via direct methods or device twins.

- **Impact:**
    - Compromise of device authentication credentials can lead to complete control over the IoT device.
    - An attacker can:
        - Impersonate the device and send malicious data to Azure IoT Hub, potentially corrupting data or disrupting services relying on device telemetry.
        - Steal data from device-to-cloud messages.
        - Control the device by sending commands (direct methods) or modifying device configuration (device twins).
        - Potentially use the compromised device as a pivot point to attack other parts of the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in code, but documentation mentions environment variables as just one option, and users can choose other more secure methods.
    - README.md and samples/README.md refer to a wiki page about [**common pitfalls**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/wiki/pitfalls) which mentions "Using Connection Strings Incorrectly".
    - Documentation contains a wiki page about pitfalls, but it does not specifically mention the risk of storing credentials in environment variables.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Secure credential management guidance and enforcement in sample code.
    - Code examples demonstrating secure credential handling using secure key vaults or configuration files instead of environment variables or hardcoding.
    - Security linter or static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials in code.
    - Emphasize in documentation and samples the security risks of using connection strings directly in code and environment variables in production.
    - The SDK should strongly discourage storing credentials in environment variables in documentation and samples, and instead promote more secure alternatives.
    - The SDK documentation and samples should provide guidance on secure credential management, such as using secure storage mechanisms (e.g. hardware security modules, secure enclaves, key vaults, encrypted files) or credential injection techniques.
    - Consider adding security best practices directly in SDK documentation, and potentially in code, e.g. warnings during development if environment variables are used for credentials.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Developers use the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python and follow the insecure credential management practices demonstrated in the provided samples or documentation.
    - Application using Azure IoT Device SDK for Python is deployed in an environment.
    - Device authentication credentials are stored in environment variables within that environment.
    - Attackers gain access to systems or repositories where developers have stored these insecure credentials or attacker gains unauthorized access to the environment where the application is running.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/samples/README.md` and `/code/samples/async-hub-scenarios/README.md` and `/code/samples/sync-samples/README.md` and `/code/samples/pnp/README.md`, `/code/samples/how-to-guides/connect_retry_with_telemetry.md`, `/code/devbox_setup.md`, `/code/migration_guide.md`, `/code/sdklab/meantimerecovery/README.md`
    - Step 1: The README.md files in the `samples`, `async-hub-scenarios`, and `sync-samples` directories instruct users to set the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. Many other documentation files also mention or imply using environment variables for storing credentials.
    - Step 2: The sample code, like `simple_send_message.py`, directly retrieves the connection string from the environment variable using `os.getenv("IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING")` and uses it to create the `IoTHubDeviceClient`.
    - Step 3: This practice is repeated across multiple samples in different directories, consistently showing insecure credential management as the primary method.
    - Step 4: Code examples in `/code/samples` directory directly use `os.getenv()` to retrieve credentials from environment variables.
    - Step 5: The `SymmetricKeyAuthenticationProvider` and `SharedAccessSignatureAuthenticationProvider` in `/code/doc` and source code are designed to parse credentials from strings, which can be easily read from environment variables.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Deploy a sample application from the repository, for example `simple_send_message.py`, following the instructions in `/code/samples/README.md`. Or Create a Python IoT device application using the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python, following the quickstart guide in `/code/samples/README.md`.
    - Step 2: Set the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable with a valid device connection string for testing purposes. Or In the application code, use `os.getenv("IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING")` to retrieve the device connection string from environment variables as shown in the quickstart guide.
    - Step 3: Run the sample application to ensure it connects to the IoT Hub and sends messages. Or Run the application and verify that it successfully connects to Azure IoT Hub and sends telemetry data.
    - Step 4: Examine the running environment of the sample application and confirm that the connection string is stored in plain text in the environment variables.
    - Step 5: As an attacker, simulate gaining access to the environment where the application is running (e.g., through a compromised system or repository access). Or As an attacker, gain access to the environment where the application is running (this step depends on the specific deployment environment and is outside the scope of this test case, assume attacker has shell access to the environment).
    - Step 6: Extract the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable in plain text. Or In the attacker's shell, inspect the environment variables (e.g., using `printenv` or `set` command in Linux/macOS or `Get-ChildItem Env:` in PowerShell on Windows).
    - Step 7: Use the extracted connection string to create a new `IoTHubDeviceClient` instance outside of the original application's environment. Or Verify that the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is present and contains the device connection string in plain text. Copy the value of `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
    - Step 8: Connect to the IoT Hub using the new `IoTHubDeviceClient` instance and perform unauthorized actions, such as sending telemetry or controlling the device twin, proving successful impersonation due to insecure credential exposure. Or As an attacker, use a separate tool (e.g., Azure IoT Explorer, `az iot hub send-d2c-message` CLI command) and configure it to connect to the Azure IoT Hub using the stolen connection string.
    - Step 9: Verify that the attacker can successfully connect to the IoT Hub using the stolen credentials and perform actions like sending messages as the compromised device or invoking direct methods.

### 2. Insecure Deserialization in Cloud-to-Device Message Handling

- **Description:**
    - 1. A remote attacker crafts a malicious payload, intending to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - 2. The attacker embeds this payload within the body of a cloud-to-device message.
    - 3. The attacker sends this crafted cloud-to-device message to a device using the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python.
    - 4. The device, using the SDK, receives the cloud-to-device message and passes the raw message data to the application layer.
    - 5. The application layer, if not designed with secure deserialization practices, might directly deserialize the message payload without proper validation or sanitization.
    - 6. If the application uses insecure deserialization methods (e.g., `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load` without safe load), the malicious payload can be executed during the deserialization process.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device. Depending on the attacker's payload and the device's permissions, this could result in a wide range of impacts, including:
        - Full device compromise.
        - Data exfiltration or corruption.
        - Denial of service.
        - Unauthorized access to device functionalities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The Azure IoT Device SDK for Python project description mentions security features such as authentication and TLS 1.2, which protect the communication channel. However, the provided project files and code analysis reveal no specific mitigations within the SDK itself against insecure deserialization of cloud-to-device message payloads. The SDK delivers the raw message payload to the application layer, leaving the responsibility of secure deserialization entirely to the application developer.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization at the SDK level for cloud-to-device messages to detect and reject potentially malicious payloads before they reach the application layer.
    - Recommendations and guidelines in the SDK documentation to educate developers about the risks of insecure deserialization and best practices for secure message handling.
    - Secure deserialization utilities or wrappers within the SDK that developers could use to safely deserialize message payloads.
    - Default secure deserialization mechanisms or warnings within the SDK to encourage secure practices.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The target device must be connected to Azure IoT Hub and utilize the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python to receive cloud-to-device messages.
    - The application running on the device must deserialize the cloud-to-device message payload.
    - The application must employ insecure deserialization methods (e.g., `pickle.loads`, `yaml.unsafe_load`) without proper input validation.
    - The attacker must have the necessary permissions to send cloud-to-device messages to the targeted device, typically requiring appropriate Azure IoT Hub service permissions.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/azure-iot-device/azure/iot/device/common/pipeline/pipeline_stages_iothub_mqtt.py`

    ```python
    class IoTHubMQTTTranslationStage(PipelineStage):
        # ...
        @pipeline_thread.runs_on_pipeline_thread
        def _handle_pipeline_event(self, event):
            # ...
            if isinstance(event, pipeline_events_mqtt.IncomingMQTTMessageEvent):
                topic = event.topic
                device_id = self.nucleus.pipeline_configuration.device_id
                module_id = self.nucleus.pipeline_configuration.module_id

                if mqtt_topic_iothub.is_c2d_topic(topic, device_id):
                    message = Message(event.payload) # Payload is passed directly to Message constructor
                    mqtt_topic_iothub.extract_message_properties_from_topic(topic, message)
                    self.send_event_up(pipeline_events_iothub.C2DMessageEvent(message))
            # ...
    ```

    - File: `/code/azure-iot-device/azure/iot/device/iothub/models/message.py`

    ```python
    class Message(object):
        # ...
        def __init__(
            self, data, message_id=None, content_encoding=None, content_type=None, output_name=None
        ):
            # ...
            self.data = data # Raw payload is stored as .data
            # ...
    ```

    - The `IoTHubMQTTTranslationStage` within the `_handle_pipeline_event` function processes `IncomingMQTTMessageEvent` events. When a cloud-to-device message topic is detected (`mqtt_topic_iothub.is_c2d_topic`), the code directly creates a `Message` object using `event.payload` without any deserialization or validation at the SDK level.
    - The `Message` class simply stores the provided `data` (which corresponds to `event.payload`) without any inherent deserialization or security checks.
    - This design indicates that the SDK's responsibility ends at delivering the raw message payload to the application. The SDK does not attempt to interpret or deserialize the payload content. Consequently, the risk of insecure deserialization is shifted to the application layer. If the application chooses to deserialize the `message.data` using insecure methods, the vulnerability can be triggered.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - 1. Prerequisites:
        - Ensure you have an Azure IoT Hub instance and a registered device using the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python.
        - Set up a Python environment with the Azure IoT Device SDK and necessary libraries (e.g., `pickle`, `PyYAML`).
        - Deploy a Python application on a device that utilizes the Azure IoT Device SDK to receive and process cloud-to-device messages. This application should **insecurely deserialize** the message payload. For example, the application could use `pickle.loads` or `yaml.unsafe_load` on `message.data`.

    - 2. Setup:
        - Configure the test device to connect to your Azure IoT Hub.
        - Prepare a testing environment where you can send cloud-to-device messages to the device. This could be through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or a custom application using the Azure IoT Hub service SDK.
        - Install `PyYAML` library if testing YAML deserialization.

    - 3. Test Procedure:
        - **Test 1: Pickle Payload**
            - Craft a malicious payload using Python's `pickle` library to execute arbitrary code. For example:
              ```python
              import pickle
              import base64
              import os

              class RunCode(object):
                  def __reduce__(self):
                      return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

              payload = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(RunCode())).decode()
              print(payload)
              ```
            - Send a cloud-to-device message to the test device. Set the message body as the base64 encoded pickle payload (from above). You can use Azure IoT Explorer or Azure CLI to send the message.
            - Observe the device's behavior. If the vulnerability is present, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` (or similar) should be executed on the device. Check for the file `/tmp/pwned` on the device to confirm code execution.

        - **Test 2: YAML Payload (if PyYAML is installed in the test application)**
            - Craft a malicious YAML payload designed to execute arbitrary code. For example, using YAML tags for code execution:
              ```yaml
              !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned_yaml"]
              ```
            - Send a cloud-to-device message to the test device with the malicious YAML payload as the message body.
            - Observe the device's behavior. If vulnerable, the command `touch /tmp/pwned_yaml` should execute. Check for the file `/tmp/pwned_yaml` on the device.

    - 4. Expected Result:
        - If the application insecurely deserializes the payload, the malicious commands embedded in the `pickle` or `YAML` payloads will be executed on the device.
        - Successful exploitation is indicated by the creation of the `/tmp/pwned` or `/tmp/pwned_yaml` files on the device, or other observable signs of code execution based on the crafted payload.
        - If the application is secure or the SDK mitigates the vulnerability (which it currently does not), the malicious payload should not be executed, and no unintended behavior should be observed.
