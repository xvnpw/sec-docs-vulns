- vulnerability name: Insecure Deserialization in Cloud-to-Device Message Handling
  - description: |
    1. A remote attacker crafts a malicious payload, intending to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.
    2. The attacker embeds this payload within the body of a cloud-to-device message.
    3. The attacker sends this crafted cloud-to-device message to a device using the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python.
    4. The device, using the SDK, receives the cloud-to-device message and passes the raw message data to the application layer.
    5. The application layer, if not designed with secure deserialization practices, might directly deserialize the message payload without proper validation or sanitization.
    6. If the application uses insecure deserialization methods (e.g., `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load` without safe load), the malicious payload can be executed during the deserialization process.
  - impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device. Depending on the attacker's payload and the device's permissions, this could result in a wide range of impacts, including:
    - Full device compromise.
    - Data exfiltration or corruption.
    - Denial of service.
    - Unauthorized access to device functionalities.
  - vulnerability rank: high
  - currently implemented mitigations: |
    The Azure IoT Device SDK for Python project description mentions security features such as authentication and TLS 1.2, which protect the communication channel. However, the provided project files and code analysis reveal no specific mitigations within the SDK itself against insecure deserialization of cloud-to-device message payloads. The SDK delivers the raw message payload to the application layer, leaving the responsibility of secure deserialization entirely to the application developer.
  - missing mitigations: |
    The Azure IoT Device SDK for Python lacks built-in mitigations for insecure deserialization. Missing mitigations include:
    - Input validation and sanitization at the SDK level for cloud-to-device messages to detect and reject potentially malicious payloads before they reach the application layer.
    - Recommendations and guidelines in the SDK documentation to educate developers about the risks of insecure deserialization and best practices for secure message handling.
    - Secure deserialization utilities or wrappers within the SDK that developers could use to safely deserialize message payloads.
    - Default secure deserialization mechanisms or warnings within the SDK to encourage secure practices.
  - preconditions:
    - The target device must be connected to Azure IoT Hub and utilize the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python to receive cloud-to-device messages.
    - The application running on the device must deserialize the cloud-to-device message payload.
    - The application must employ insecure deserialization methods (e.g., `pickle.loads`, `yaml.unsafe_load`) without proper input validation.
    - The attacker must have the necessary permissions to send cloud-to-device messages to the targeted device, typically requiring appropriate Azure IoT Hub service permissions.
  - source code analysis: |
    The provided code files, specifically within `/code/azure-iot-device/azure/iot/device/common/pipeline/pipeline_stages_iothub_mqtt.py`, show how cloud-to-device messages are processed:

    ```python
    class IoTHubMQTTTranslationStage(PipelineStage):
        # ...
        @pipeline_thread.runs_on_pipeline_thread
        def _handle_pipeline_event(self, event):
            # ...
            if isinstance(event, pipeline_events_mqtt.IncomingMQTTMessageEvent):
                topic = event.topic
                device_id = self.nucleus.pipeline_configuration.device_id
                module_id = self.nucleus.pipeline_configuration.module_id

                if mqtt_topic_iothub.is_c2d_topic(topic, device_id):
                    message = Message(event.payload) # Payload is passed directly to Message constructor
                    mqtt_topic_iothub.extract_message_properties_from_topic(topic, message)
                    self.send_event_up(pipeline_events_iothub.C2DMessageEvent(message))
            # ...
    ```

    The `IoTHubMQTTTranslationStage` within the `_handle_pipeline_event` function processes `IncomingMQTTMessageEvent` events. When a cloud-to-device message topic is detected (`mqtt_topic_iothub.is_c2d_topic`), the code directly creates a `Message` object using `event.payload` without any deserialization or validation at the SDK level.

    ```python
    message = Message(event.payload)
    ```

    The `Message` class, defined in `/code/azure-iot-device/azure/iot/device/iothub/models/message.py`, simply stores the provided `data` (which corresponds to `event.payload`) without any inherent deserialization or security checks:

    ```python
    class Message(object):
        # ...
        def __init__(
            self, data, message_id=None, content_encoding=None, content_type=None, output_name=None
        ):
            # ...
            self.data = data # Raw payload is stored as .data
            # ...
    ```

    This design indicates that the SDK's responsibility ends at delivering the raw message payload to the application. The SDK does not attempt to interpret or deserialize the payload content. Consequently, the risk of insecure deserialization is shifted to the application layer. If the application chooses to deserialize the `message.data` using insecure methods, the vulnerability can be triggered.

  - security test case: |
    1. Prerequisites:
      - Ensure you have an Azure IoT Hub instance and a registered device using the Azure IoT Device SDK for Python.
      - Set up a Python environment with the Azure IoT Device SDK and necessary libraries (e.g., `pickle`, `PyYAML`).
      - Deploy a Python application on a device that utilizes the Azure IoT Device SDK to receive and process cloud-to-device messages. This application should **insecurely deserialize** the message payload. For example, the application could use `pickle.loads` or `yaml.unsafe_load` on `message.data`.

    2. Setup:
      - Configure the test device to connect to your Azure IoT Hub.
      - Prepare a testing environment where you can send cloud-to-device messages to the device. This could be through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or a custom application using the Azure IoT Hub service SDK.
      - Install `PyYAML` library if testing YAML deserialization.

    3. Test Procedure:
      - **Test 1: Pickle Payload**
        - Craft a malicious payload using Python's `pickle` library to execute arbitrary code. For example:
          ```python
          import pickle
          import base64
          import os

          class RunCode(object):
              def __reduce__(self):
                  return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

          payload = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(RunCode())).decode()
          print(payload)
          ```
        - Send a cloud-to-device message to the test device. Set the message body as the base64 encoded pickle payload (from above). You can use Azure IoT Explorer or Azure CLI to send the message.
        - Observe the device's behavior. If the vulnerability is present, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` (or similar) should be executed on the device. Check for the file `/tmp/pwned` on the device to confirm code execution.

      - **Test 2: YAML Payload (if PyYAML is installed in the test application)**
        - Craft a malicious YAML payload designed to execute arbitrary code. For example, using YAML tags for code execution:
          ```yaml
          !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned_yaml"]
          ```
        - Send a cloud-to-device message to the test device with the malicious YAML payload as the message body.
        - Observe the device's behavior. If vulnerable, the command `touch /tmp/pwned_yaml` should execute. Check for the file `/tmp/pwned_yaml` on the device.

    4. Expected Result:
      - If the application insecurely deserializes the payload, the malicious commands embedded in the `pickle` or `YAML` payloads will be executed on the device.
      - Successful exploitation is indicated by the creation of the `/tmp/pwned` or `/tmp/pwned_yaml` files on the device, or other observable signs of code execution based on the crafted payload.
      - If the application is secure or the SDK mitigates the vulnerability (which it currently does not), the malicious payload should not be executed, and no unintended behavior should be observed.
