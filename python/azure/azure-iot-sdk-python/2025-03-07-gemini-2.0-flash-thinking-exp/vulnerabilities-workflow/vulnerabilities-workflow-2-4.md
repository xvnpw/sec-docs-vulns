- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Device Connection String in Environment Variables
- Description:
    1. The `samples/README.md` and `samples/async-hub-scenarios/README.md` files instruct users to store the device connection string in environment variables (e.g., `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`).
    2. Environment variables are often stored in plain text and can be easily accessed by other processes or users on the same system, especially if the device is compromised.
    3. If an attacker gains access to the IoT device (e.g., through physical access or other vulnerabilities), they can easily retrieve the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.
    4. With the connection string, the attacker can impersonate the IoT device and send malicious data or commands to the Azure IoT Hub.
- Impact:
    - High. Device impersonation, unauthorized data transmission, and potential control of the IoT Hub through a compromised device.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The documentation explicitly encourages storing the connection string in environment variables.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure storage mechanisms for device credentials should be implemented and recommended, such as:
        - Using a secure key vault or dedicated credential management system.
        - Encrypting the connection string at rest.
        - Avoiding storing credentials directly in environment variables, especially for production deployments.
        - Emphasize the importance of secure credential handling in documentation and samples, and provide examples of secure storage methods.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker gains access to the IoT device where an application built with this library is running.
    - The application is configured to use a connection string stored in an environment variable as per the documentation.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/samples/README.md`
        ```
        5. On your device, set the Device Connection String as an environment variable called `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
        ...
        **Linux (bash)**
        ```bash
        export IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your connection string here>"
        ```
    - File: `/code/samples/async-hub-scenarios/README.md`
        ```
        In order to use these samples, you **must** set your Device Connection String in the environment variable `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
        ```
    - File: `/code/samples/samples/simple_send_message.py`
        ```python
        async def main():
            # Fetch the connection string from an environment variable
            conn_str = os.getenv("IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING")
        ```
    - Visualization: Not needed for this vulnerability, the code snippets are sufficient to show the insecure practice.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a sample application from the `samples` directory, e.g., `simple_send_message.py`, and follow the instructions to set the `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable with a valid device connection string.
    2. Deploy the application to an IoT device (or a virtual machine simulating an IoT device).
    3. Gain access to the IoT device's shell (e.g., via SSH or physical access).
    4. Execute the command to list environment variables (e.g., `printenv` or `set` or `Get-ChildItem Env:` depending on the OS).
    5. Verify that `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` is present in the environment variables and contains the plain text connection string.
    6. Using the retrieved connection string, use a separate tool or script to impersonate the device and send telemetry to the IoT Hub or perform other actions like updating device twin or invoking direct methods. This will validate that the attacker can successfully use the exposed credential.
