### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal via Manifest File Paths

* Description:
    1. A privileged user with access to create or modify manifest files can introduce a path traversal vulnerability.
    2. By crafting a malicious manifest, the attacker can specify file paths that traverse outside the intended directories. For example, in a manifest intended to collect logs from `/var/log`, an attacker could specify a path like `copy,../../../etc/passwd`.
    3. When the Azure Disk Inspect Service processes this manifest, it reads the "copy" operation and the malicious file path.
    4. If the service code lacks proper input validation and sanitization of the file paths extracted from the manifest, it will directly use the attacker-controlled path to access files on the OS disk.
    5. This allows the attacker to bypass the intended restrictions and access arbitrary files on the OS disk, such as sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, or private keys located outside the intended "well known contents".

* Impact:
    * An attacker can read arbitrary files from the OS disk.
    * This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including:
        - System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`).
        - Secrets and credentials stored in files.
        - Private keys (e.g., SSH private keys).
        - Any other data accessible on the file system, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or related services.

* Vulnerability rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None apparent from the provided documentation. The documentation focuses on functionality and usage, but does not mention any input validation or sanitization mechanisms for manifest file paths.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on file paths read from manifest files. This should include:
        - Validating that the paths are within the expected base directories or a predefined whitelist of allowed paths.
        - Sanitizing paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like `../` and symbolic links.
    * **Path Normalization:** Normalize file paths to their canonical form to prevent bypasses using different path representations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict the service's access rights to the minimum necessary for its intended functionality. Avoid running the service with excessive privileges that could be exploited if a path traversal vulnerability is present.
    * **Manifest Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of manifest files to prevent unauthorized modifications.

* Preconditions:
    * A privileged user account is required to create or modify manifest files.
    * The Azure Disk Inspect Service must be running and configured to process user-provided manifests.
    * The service code must be vulnerable to path traversal, meaning it lacks sufficient validation and sanitization of file paths from manifests.

* Source code analysis:
    * While the service code is not provided, we can analyze the `parse_manifest.py` script and infer how manifests are structured and processed.
    * The `parse_manifest.py` script reads manifest files and extracts operations and file paths based on comma separation.
    * Example manifest line: `copy, /var/log/waagent*`
    * The script does not perform any validation or sanitization on the file paths; it simply extracts them for documentation purposes.
    * **Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Snippet (Service Side):**
        ```python
        import os

        def process_manifest_line(manifest_line):
            operation, file_path = manifest_line.split(',', 1)
            if operation.strip() == 'copy':
                copy_file(file_path.strip())

        def copy_file(file_path):
            base_path = "/mnt/osdisk" # Hypothetical mount point of the OS disk
            full_file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_path) # Vulnerable path construction
            try:
                with open(full_file_path, 'r') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                # ... process file content ...
                print(f"Content of {file_path}: {content[:100]}...") # Print first 100 chars
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")

        # Example usage:
        manifest_content = "copy,../../../etc/passwd"
        process_manifest_line(manifest_content)
        ```
    * **Vulnerability Explanation:** In the hypothetical code, `os.path.join` is used to construct the full file path by simply joining the `base_path` and the `file_path` from the manifest. If `file_path` contains path traversal sequences like `../../../`, `os.path.join` will resolve them, allowing access outside the intended `base_path`.

* Security test case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Set up a test environment where you can interact with the Azure Disk Inspect Service and provide custom manifests. Assume you have privileged access to create manifests.
    2. **Create Malicious Manifest:** Create a new manifest file named `path_traversal_manifest` with the following content:
        ```
        copy,../../../etc/passwd
        ```
    3. **Trigger Disk Inspection:** Initiate a disk inspection job using the `path_traversal_manifest`. The exact method to specify the manifest depends on the service's API or interface (not provided in the files, assuming a mechanism exists for privileged users).
    4. **Analyze Service Output:** After the inspection job completes, examine the service output, specifically the `results.txt` file or any logs generated by the service.
    5. **Verify Path Traversal:** Check if the output contains the content of the `/etc/passwd` file. If the output includes the typical structure of a `/etc/passwd` file (e.g., lines with usernames, UIDs, GIDs, home directories, shells), it confirms that the path traversal was successful and arbitrary file access was achieved.
    6. **Expected Output (Example):** The `results.txt` file should contain content similar to the beginning of a `/etc/passwd` file:
        ```text
        root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
        daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
        bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
        sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
        ... and so on ...
        ```
    7. **Cleanup:** Delete the `path_traversal_manifest` and any test artifacts.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability to read sensitive files using a maliciously crafted manifest.
