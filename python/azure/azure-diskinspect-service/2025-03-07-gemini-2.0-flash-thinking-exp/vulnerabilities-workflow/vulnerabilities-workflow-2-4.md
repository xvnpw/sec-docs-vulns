#### 1. Missing Authorization for Disk Inspection Operations
* Description:
    1. An attacker attempts to interact with the Azure Disk Inspect Service, assuming they have found a publicly accessible endpoint or interface.
    2. The attacker sends a request to perform a disk inspection operation, such as listing a directory (e.g., `ll,/var/log`), querying the registry (e.g., `reg, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProgramFilesDir`), or retrieving disk information (e.g., `diskinfo,`).
    3. The service processes the request and performs the disk inspection operation without verifying if the attacker is a privileged user.
    4. The service returns the results of the disk inspection operation (e.g., directory listing, registry value, disk information) to the attacker.
* Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data residing on Azure OS disks.
    - An attacker could potentially retrieve configuration files, logs, registry settings, and other sensitive information.
    - This information could be used to gain further unauthorized access to the system or to understand the system's configuration for malicious purposes.
* Vulnerability rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None mentioned in the provided project files. The README.md file mentions "privileged access" is intended, but no details on how this is enforced are present in the provided documentation.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust authentication to verify the identity of the user accessing the service.
    - Implement authorization mechanisms to ensure that only privileged users are allowed to perform disk inspection operations. This could involve role-based access control (RBAC) or similar authorization policies.
    - The service should validate user credentials against a trusted authority before processing any requests.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to reach and interact with the Azure Disk Inspect Service's interface or API.
    - The service must be deployed without proper authorization checks enabled or correctly implemented.
* Source code analysis:
    - No source code is provided in the PROJECT FILES. Therefore, source code analysis cannot be performed.
    - Based on the documentation, the service functionality is triggered by specific monikers in manifests (like `ll`, `reg`, `diskinfo`).
    - It is presumed that the vulnerability would reside in the service's backend logic, where the requests with these monikers are processed without proper authorization checks before accessing the disk data.
* Security test case:
    1. Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the Azure Disk Inspect Service (assuming deployment instructions are available or can be inferred).
    2. As an external attacker, without any privileged credentials or specific authentication tokens, craft a request to the service's API endpoint. This request should include a valid manifest command to trigger a disk inspection operation, for example, listing the root directory on a Linux OS disk using the `ll` moniker and path `/`. The request might look like: `POST /api/inspect -d 'manifest=ll,/'` (assuming a REST API and manifest parameter).
    3. Send the crafted request to the deployed Azure Disk Inspect Service instance.
    4. Analyze the response from the service.
    5. If the service returns a directory listing of the root directory (or any other sensitive data from the OS disk) without prompting for authentication or authorization, then the "Missing Authorization for Disk Inspection Operations" vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that an unprivileged attacker can access sensitive disk data.
    6. If the service returns an error indicating "Unauthorized", "Forbidden", or prompts for authentication, then the vulnerability is not directly exploitable via this test case, and further investigation into other potential bypass methods would be needed.
