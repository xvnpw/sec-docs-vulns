## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities within the MLOps project. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, severity ranking, current mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case.

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Insecure Azure Service Principal Credentials Management

* Description:
    1. The MLOps v2 template guides users to set up Azure infrastructure and ML pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
    2. These pipelines require Azure Service Principal credentials to authenticate and authorize actions against Azure resources.
    3. The provided project files, particularly the pipeline definitions (e.g., `/code/infrastructure/bicep/pipelines/bicep-ado-deploy-infra.yml`, `/code/infrastructure/terraform/github-actions/tf-gha-deploy-infra.yml`, `/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-model-training-pipeline.yml`, etc.), rely on templates from the `Azure/mlops-templates` repository (e.g., `uses: Azure/mlops-templates/.github/workflows/read-yaml.yml@main`, `template: templates/infra/create-resource-group.yml@mlops-templates`, etc.).
    4. If the `mlops-templates` repository contains templates that encourage or allow insecure credential management practices (e.g., hardcoding credentials in pipeline definitions, storing credentials in source code, logging credentials), users following this template may inadvertently expose their Azure Service Principal credentials.
    5. An attacker gaining access to these exposed credentials could then impersonate the Service Principal and gain unauthorized access to the Azure resources deployed by the MLOps system.

* Impact:
    - **High/Critical:** Unauthorized access to Azure resources including the Azure Machine Learning workspace, storage accounts, key vaults, container registry, and potentially other deployed services.
    - Data exfiltration: An attacker could access and download sensitive data stored in Azure Storage or used by ML models.
    - Resource manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete Azure resources, disrupt ML pipelines, inject malicious code into ML models or deployments, or use compute resources for cryptocurrency mining or other malicious activities.
    - Lateral movement: Compromised credentials could potentially be used to access other Azure subscriptions or resources if the Service Principal has overly broad permissions.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project files utilize Azure DevOps service connections and GitHub Actions secrets (e.g., `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, `$(ado_service_connection_rg)`). This indicates an attempt to use secure credential storage mechanisms provided by these platforms.
    - The `SECURITY.md` file encourages reporting security vulnerabilities through private channels (MSRC), not public GitHub issues.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Credential Management Guidance:** The project lacks explicit documentation and guidance on secure credential management practices for Azure Service Principals. This should include:
        - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Guidance on creating Service Principals with only the necessary permissions (e.g., using custom roles in Azure RBAC).
        - **Secure Storage:** Strong recommendations against hardcoding credentials and clear instructions on using secure secret storage mechanisms provided by Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions (Service Connections, Secrets).
        - **Credential Rotation:** Best practices for regular rotation of Service Principal secrets.
        - **Auditing and Monitoring:** Guidance on enabling auditing and monitoring of Service Principal usage to detect suspicious activities.
    - **Secure Templates in `mlops-templates`:** The `mlops-templates` repository needs to be reviewed and hardened to ensure that templates do not introduce or encourage insecure credential management practices. Templates should:
        - **Force parameterization of credentials:** Templates should always use variables or parameters for credentials, forcing users to provide them through secure channels (Service Connections, Secrets).
        - **Avoid logging credentials:** Templates should be carefully reviewed to ensure no credentials or secrets are logged in pipeline outputs or logs.
        - **Provide secure examples:** Examples within templates and documentation should always demonstrate secure credential handling.
    - **Automated Security Checks:** Implement automated security checks (e.g., static analysis, secret scanning) in the project and in the `mlops-templates` repository to detect potential credential exposure risks.

* Preconditions:
    - Users implementing the MLOps v2 template follow insecure practices for managing Azure Service Principal credentials, either due to lack of guidance or by ignoring secure practices.
    - Vulnerable templates exist in the `Azure/mlops-templates` repository that facilitate or allow insecure credential management.
    - An attacker gains access to the insecurely managed credentials. This could happen through various means, including:
        - Access to source code repositories where credentials are hardcoded or stored insecurely.
        - Access to pipeline logs or outputs where credentials are exposed.
        - Compromise of developer machines or CI/CD systems where credentials are stored or used.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided code does not directly hardcode credentials.
    - The pipeline definitions (e.g., `/code/infrastructure/bicep/pipelines/bicep-ado-deploy-infra.yml`, `/code/infrastructure/terraform/github-actions/tf-gha-deploy-infra.yml`) use variables like `ado_service_connection_rg` and `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` which suggests the intention to use secure credential management.
    - **However, the vulnerability is likely introduced by the reusable templates from `Azure/mlops-templates` repository, which are invoked by these pipeline definitions.** Without access to the `mlops-templates` repository, a direct source code analysis to pinpoint the insecure template code is not possible.
    - **Example Scenario (Hypothetical Vulnerable Template in `mlops-templates`):**
        - Assume a template in `mlops-templates` named `templates/infra/create-aml-workspace.yml` contains a task that directly embeds a Service Principal secret value retrieved from a parameter into an Azure CLI command, instead of using a secure way to pass the credential.
        - A pipeline like `/code/infrastructure/bicep/pipelines/bicep-ado-deploy-infra.yml` might then pass the Service Principal secret as a parameter to this template, inadvertently making it less secure if the template itself handles it insecurely.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create an Azure DevOps pipeline or GitHub Actions workflow based on the provided project files, specifically one that deploys infrastructure (e.g., `/code/infrastructure/terraform/github-actions/tf-gha-deploy-infra.yml`).
        - Configure the pipeline to use an Azure Service Principal for authentication.
        - **Hypothetical Vulnerability Injection (Simulate a vulnerable template):** Modify a template in `mlops-templates` (if possible, or create a local mock template for testing) to intentionally log the Service Principal secret value to the pipeline logs during deployment. For example, in a bash script within a template, add `echo "Service Principal Secret: $service_principal_secret"` where `$service_principal_secret` is a parameter intended to hold the secret.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the pipeline to deploy the Azure infrastructure.
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Check Pipeline Logs:** Examine the logs of the pipeline execution.
        - **Vulnerability Confirmation:** If the Service Principal secret value is visible in the pipeline logs (as introduced by the hypothetical vulnerable template modification), then the vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that insecure templates can lead to credential exposure through pipeline logs.
    4. **Expected Result (Vulnerable Case):** The Service Principal secret will be found in plain text within the pipeline execution logs, proving the vulnerability.
    5. **Expected Result (Mitigated Case - if mitigations were in place):** The Service Principal secret should *not* be found in plain text in the pipeline logs. Secure credential handling would ensure that secrets are only passed securely and not exposed in logs or outputs.

### 2. Vulnerability Name: Dependency Vulnerabilities in Docker Images and Conda Environments

* Description:
    - The project uses Dockerfiles and Conda environment files to define the environments for training and inference.
    - These files specify versions for Python packages (e.g., in `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `conda_env.yml`).
    - If the specified versions of these packages contain known security vulnerabilities, any deployed ML application using these environments will inherit these vulnerabilities.
    - An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities in the deployed application.
    - To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to target a specific vulnerability in one of the outdated dependencies used in the project's environment definitions.

* Impact:
    - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the outdated dependency. It could range from information disclosure, arbitrary code execution to denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and how the vulnerable dependency is used in the deployed application.
    - In the context of the specified attack vectors, a deserialization vulnerability in a dependency used for input handling could be directly exploitable.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files. The project specifies dependency versions but does not include mechanisms for vulnerability scanning or automatic updates.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Dependency Scanning**: Implement dependency scanning tools (like `safety`, `snyk`, or GitHub Dependabot) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    - **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Consider using dependency management tools to automate updates and track dependency health.
    - **Pinning Dependencies with Security Audits**: While pinning dependencies is done, it should be coupled with regular security audits to ensure pinned versions remain secure and are updated when necessary.

* Preconditions:
    - The deployed application must rely on one or more of the specified dependencies in the Dockerfiles or Conda environment files.
    - A known security vulnerability must exist in one of the specified dependency versions.
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the deployed application.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/cv/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environment/Dockerfile, /code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environments/training/Dockerfile, /code/nlp/python-sdk-v2/data-science/environments/training/Dockerfile**: These Dockerfiles use `COPY requirements.txt ./` and `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`. The `requirements.txt` file is not provided in the PROJECT FILES, so we can't analyze its content directly. However, this pattern indicates dependencies are installed from a potentially unmanaged list.
    - **File: /code/environment.yml, /code/cv/python-sdk-v1/data-science/environment/training/conda_dependencies.yml, /code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environments/inference/conda_env.yml, /code/nlp/python-sdk-v2/data-science/environments/inference/conda_env.yml, /code/classical/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environment/train-conda.yml, /code/classical/rai-aml-cli-v2/data-science/environment/train-conda.yml, /code/classical/python-sdk-v1/data-science/environment/train.yml, /code/classical/python-sdk-v1/data-science/environment/train_monitor.yml, /code/classical/python-sdk-v1/data-science/environment/batch.yml, /code/classical/python-sdk-v1/data-science/environment/batch_monitor.yml, /code/classical/python-sdk-v2/data-science/environment/train-conda.yml, /code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/train/train-env.yaml, /code/classical/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environment/train-conda.yml, /code/classical/rai-aml-cli-v2/data-science/environment/train-conda.yml**: These YAML files define Conda environments, listing dependencies with specific versions (e.g., `scikit-learn==0.24.2`, `flask==1.1.2`, `transformers==4.17.0`).  These specific versions might contain vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** `nlp/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environments/inference/conda_env.yml` specifies `transformers==4.17.0`.  Checking vulnerability databases, we can find if version 4.17.0 of `transformers` has any known vulnerabilities. If yes, and if the scoring script (`score.py`) uses a vulnerable part of the `transformers` library to process input, then this becomes a valid attack vector.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Identify Vulnerable Dependency**: Choose a dependency listed in one of the environment files (e.g., `transformers==4.17.0` in `/code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/data-science/environments/inference/conda_env.yml`). Search online vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE) for known vulnerabilities in this specific version.
    2. **Verify Vulnerability Exploitability**: If a relevant vulnerability is found (e.g., a deserialization flaw or code execution vulnerability), analyze the project's `score.py` or relevant application code to see if the vulnerable dependency and code path are used in a way that is exposed to external input. For instance, check if `score.py` deserializes untrusted data using a vulnerable function from the identified library.
    3. **Craft Malicious Input**: If exploitability is confirmed, craft a malicious input that leverages the vulnerability. For example, if it's a deserialization vulnerability, create a malicious serialized payload. If it's a prompt injection, craft a malicious prompt.
    4. **Send Malicious Input to Deployed Endpoint**: Deploy the NLP summarization endpoint as described in the project documentation. Send the crafted malicious input to the deployed online endpoint.
    5. **Observe Exploitation**: Monitor the application logs or system behavior to confirm if the vulnerability is successfully exploited. For a deserialization vulnerability, this might manifest as code execution or unexpected application behavior. For prompt injection (less relevant in this specific code but conceptually), it would be observing unintended model behavior based on the injected prompt.
    6. **Remediation**: Update the vulnerable dependency to a patched version in the relevant environment file (e.g., upgrade `transformers` to a version > 4.17.0 that fixes the vulnerability) and redeploy the application to mitigate the vulnerability. Re-run the test case to verify the vulnerability is no longer exploitable.

### 3. Vulnerability Name: Insecure API Key Authentication for Online Endpoints

* Description: Online endpoints in this MLOps system are configured to use API key authentication. This approach relies on the security of the API keys. If these keys are not securely generated, stored, and managed, they can become a point of vulnerability. An attacker who obtains a valid API key can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the online endpoint, potentially accessing the machine learning model, data, or functionalities exposed through the endpoint. The project lacks explicit mechanisms for secure API key generation, rotation, and management, increasing the risk of key compromise.
    1. An attacker identifies a deployed online endpoint URL.
    2. The attacker attempts to access the endpoint without providing an API key and observes that authentication is required (e.g., receives an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error).
    3. The attacker attempts to obtain a valid API key. This could be through various means outside the scope of these project files, such as:
        - Social engineering to trick administrators into revealing the key.
        - Finding the key if it is inadvertently exposed in logs, insecure configurations, or less secure storage locations (not evident in provided files but a general risk with API keys).
        - In less likely scenarios, brute-forcing if keys are weak or if rate limiting is absent.
    4. Once a valid API key is obtained, the attacker includes it in the request headers (typically as `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` or similar, depending on the specific endpoint implementation, which is not detailed in these files but is standard practice for API key authentication).
    5. The attacker successfully authenticates to the online endpoint and can now send requests to the model, potentially gaining access to prediction services, model details, or other exposed functionalities.

* Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the deployed machine learning model and its functionalities. Depending on the model and the endpoint's purpose, this could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration if the model endpoint serves sensitive data.
    - Model theft, allowing the attacker to use or redistribute the proprietary model.
    - Manipulation of model predictions if the endpoint allows for input manipulation, potentially leading to business disruption or incorrect decisions based on model outputs.
    - Further system compromise if the endpoint has broader access or vulnerabilities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - API key authentication is configured for online endpoints, as indicated by the `auth_mode: key` setting in `online-endpoint.yml` files (e.g., `/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`). This implements a basic level of access control, requiring a key for endpoint access.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure API key generation:** The project doesn't specify how API keys are generated. Missing secure generation practices (e.g., using cryptographically secure random number generators to create long, unpredictable keys) could result in weak or easily guessable keys.
    - **Secure API key storage and management:** The project does not detail how API keys should be stored and managed. Best practices like using Azure Key Vault or similar secret management services are not mentioned or implemented.
    - **API key rotation:** There is no key rotation policy described. Regularly rotating API keys is crucial to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
    - **Rate limiting:** The project doesn't include rate limiting on the online endpoints. Rate limiting is essential to prevent brute-force attacks aimed at discovering valid API keys or overwhelming the endpoint with requests.
    - **Monitoring and logging of API access:** While general monitoring might be enabled (`enable_monitoring: false` is set in config files, suggesting it can be enabled), specific monitoring and logging of API endpoint access, especially failed authentication attempts, is not explicitly configured. Such monitoring is important for detecting suspicious activities and potential attacks.

* Preconditions:
    - An online endpoint must be successfully deployed using the provided MLOps templates and configurations.
    - The online endpoint must be configured to use API key authentication (which is the default and configured in provided `online-endpoint.yml` files).
    - The attacker needs to be able to reach the publicly exposed URL of the deployed online endpoint.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Endpoint Configuration Files (`/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`, `/code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`, `/code/classical/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`):
        ```yaml
        $schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json
        name: dogs-classifier-online # Example name
        description: Stanford Dogs Classifier
        auth_mode: key
        ```
        These files explicitly set `auth_mode: key`, enforcing API key authentication for online endpoints. This is a positive security control in principle, but its effectiveness depends entirely on how API keys are handled, which is not detailed in the project.
    - Deployment Pipelines (`/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`, `/code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`, `/code/classical/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`):
        These pipelines automate the deployment of online endpoints using the configurations defined in the `online-endpoint.yml` files. They do not include any steps for secure API key management, suggesting that this crucial aspect is either implicitly handled by Azure ML (auto-generation, initial storage) or completely left to the user, which can be a security gap if users are not properly guided.
    - Absence of Key Management Code: A review of the provided code files reveals no custom scripts or configurations for generating, storing, rotating, or otherwise securely managing the API keys. This absence reinforces the conclusion that secure key management is a missing mitigation in the project's scope.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy an online endpoint: Use one of the provided deployment pipelines (e.g., `/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`) to deploy an online endpoint in an Azure ML Workspace. Ensure the deployment is successful and the endpoint is active.
    2. Identify the endpoint URL: Obtain the URL of the deployed online endpoint from the Azure ML Workspace portal or using Azure CLI commands. This is the public access point to the deployed model.
    3. Attempt unauthenticated access: Send a request to the endpoint URL without including any API key or authentication headers. For example, using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl <ENDPOINT_URL>
        ```
        Expected Result: The request should be rejected with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized or similar error, indicating that authentication is required.
    4. Obtain a valid API key: Retrieve the API key for the deployed endpoint from the Azure ML Workspace. In a real attack scenario, an attacker would attempt to find this key through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. For testing purposes, you can retrieve it from the Azure portal under the endpoint settings or using Azure CLI.
    5. Authenticated access with API key: Send a request to the endpoint URL, now including the API key in the request header. For example, using `curl` with the `-H` flag to add a header (the exact header name might vary based on endpoint implementation, but `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` is a common standard):
        ```bash
        API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>" # Replace with the actual API key obtained in step 4
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" <ENDPOINT_URL>
        ```
        Expected Result: The request should be successful (HTTP 200 OK or appropriate response code), and you should receive a response from the model endpoint, indicating successful authentication and access to the endpoint using the API key.
    6. (Optional, advanced and depends on access to deployed environment): Attempt to locate API key in logs or configurations: In a real-world scenario, an attacker might try to find misconfigurations that expose the API key. While not directly testable through code review of these files, you could, in a deployed test environment, simulate searching for the API key in logs, environment variables, or configuration files that might be inadvertently exposed or insecurely stored if security best practices are not followed during deployment and operation. This step is more about demonstrating the *potential* for insecure key management rather than directly exploiting a vulnerability *within* the provided project files.

This test case validates that API key authentication is enabled (as configured), but highlights the broader vulnerability related to the lack of secure API key management guidance and implementation within the project, which is a critical security consideration for real-world deployments.
