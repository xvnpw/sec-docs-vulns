- Vulnerability Name: Insecure API Key Authentication for Online Endpoints
- Description: Online endpoints in this MLOps system are configured to use API key authentication. This approach relies on the security of the API keys. If these keys are not securely generated, stored, and managed, they can become a point of vulnerability. An attacker who obtains a valid API key can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the online endpoint, potentially accessing the machine learning model, data, or functionalities exposed through the endpoint. The project lacks explicit mechanisms for secure API key generation, rotation, and management, increasing the risk of key compromise.
    1. An attacker identifies a deployed online endpoint URL.
    2. The attacker attempts to access the endpoint without providing an API key and observes that authentication is required (e.g., receives an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error).
    3. The attacker attempts to obtain a valid API key. This could be through various means outside the scope of these project files, such as:
        - Social engineering to trick administrators into revealing the key.
        - Finding the key if it is inadvertently exposed in logs, insecure configurations, or less secure storage locations (not evident in provided files but a general risk with API keys).
        - In less likely scenarios, brute-forcing if keys are weak or if rate limiting is absent.
    4. Once a valid API key is obtained, the attacker includes it in the request headers (typically as `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` or similar, depending on the specific endpoint implementation, which is not detailed in these files but is standard practice for API key authentication).
    5. The attacker successfully authenticates to the online endpoint and can now send requests to the model, potentially gaining access to prediction services, model details, or other exposed functionalities.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the deployed machine learning model and its functionalities. Depending on the model and the endpoint's purpose, this could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration if the model endpoint serves sensitive data.
    - Model theft, allowing the attacker to use or redistribute the proprietary model.
    - Manipulation of model predictions if the endpoint allows for input manipulation, potentially leading to business disruption or incorrect decisions based on model outputs.
    - Further system compromise if the endpoint has broader access or vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - API key authentication is configured for online endpoints, as indicated by the `auth_mode: key` setting in `online-endpoint.yml` files (e.g., `/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`). This implements a basic level of access control, requiring a key for endpoint access.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure API key generation: The project doesn't specify how API keys are generated. Missing secure generation practices (e.g., using cryptographically secure random number generators to create long, unpredictable keys) could result in weak or easily guessable keys.
    - Secure API key storage and management: The project does not detail how API keys should be stored and managed. Best practices like using Azure Key Vault or similar secret management services are not mentioned or implemented.
    - API key rotation: There is no key rotation policy described. Regularly rotating API keys is crucial to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
    - Rate limiting: The project doesn't include rate limiting on the online endpoints. Rate limiting is essential to prevent brute-force attacks aimed at discovering valid API keys or overwhelming the endpoint with requests.
    - Monitoring and logging of API access: While general monitoring might be enabled (`enable_monitoring: false` is set in config files, suggesting it can be enabled), specific monitoring and logging of API endpoint access, especially failed authentication attempts, is not explicitly configured. Such monitoring is important for detecting suspicious activities and potential attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - An online endpoint must be successfully deployed using the provided MLOps templates and configurations.
    - The online endpoint must be configured to use API key authentication (which is the default and configured in provided `online-endpoint.yml` files).
    - The attacker needs to be able to reach the publicly exposed URL of the deployed online endpoint.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Endpoint Configuration Files (`/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`, `/code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`, `/code/classical/aml-cli-v2/mlops/azureml/deploy/online/online-endpoint.yml`):
        ```yaml
        $schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json
        name: dogs-classifier-online # Example name
        description: Stanford Dogs Classifier
        auth_mode: key
        ```
        These files explicitly set `auth_mode: key`, enforcing API key authentication for online endpoints. This is a positive security control in principle, but its effectiveness depends entirely on how API keys are handled, which is not detailed in the project.
    - Deployment Pipelines (`/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`, `/code/nlp/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`, `/code/classical/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`):
        These pipelines automate the deployment of online endpoints using the configurations defined in the `online-endpoint.yml` files. They do not include any steps for secure API key management, suggesting that this crucial aspect is either implicitly handled by Azure ML (auto-generation, initial storage) or completely left to the user, which can be a security gap if users are not properly guided.
    - Absence of Key Management Code: A review of the provided code files reveals no custom scripts or configurations for generating, storing, rotating, or otherwise securely managing the API keys. This absence reinforces the conclusion that secure key management is a missing mitigation in the project's scope.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy an online endpoint: Use one of the provided deployment pipelines (e.g., `/code/cv/aml-cli-v2/mlops/github-actions/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml`) to deploy an online endpoint in an Azure ML Workspace. Ensure the deployment is successful and the endpoint is active.
    2. Identify the endpoint URL: Obtain the URL of the deployed online endpoint from the Azure ML Workspace portal or using Azure CLI commands. This is the public access point to the deployed model.
    3. Attempt unauthenticated access: Send a request to the endpoint URL without including any API key or authentication headers. For example, using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl <ENDPOINT_URL>
        ```
        Expected Result: The request should be rejected with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized or similar error, indicating that authentication is required.
    4. Obtain a valid API key: Retrieve the API key for the deployed endpoint from the Azure ML Workspace. In a real attack scenario, an attacker would attempt to find this key through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. For testing purposes, you can retrieve it from the Azure portal under the endpoint settings or using Azure CLI.
    5. Authenticated access with API key: Send a request to the endpoint URL, now including the API key in the request header. For example, using `curl` with the `-H` flag to add a header (the exact header name might vary based on endpoint implementation, but `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` is a common standard):
        ```bash
        API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>" # Replace with the actual API key obtained in step 4
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" <ENDPOINT_URL>
        ```
        Expected Result: The request should be successful (HTTP 200 OK or appropriate response code), and you should receive a response from the model endpoint, indicating successful authentication and access to the endpoint using the API key.
    6. (Optional, advanced and depends on access to deployed environment): Attempt to locate API key in logs or configurations: In a real-world scenario, an attacker might try to find misconfigurations that expose the API key. While not directly testable through code review of these files, you could, in a deployed test environment, simulate searching for the API key in logs, environment variables, or configuration files that might be inadvertently exposed or insecurely stored if security best practices are not followed during deployment and operation. This step is more about demonstrating the *potential* for insecure key management rather than directly exploiting a vulnerability *within* the provided project files.

This test case validates that API key authentication is enabled (as configured), but highlights the broader vulnerability related to the lack of secure API key management guidance and implementation within the project, which is a critical security consideration for real-world deployments.
