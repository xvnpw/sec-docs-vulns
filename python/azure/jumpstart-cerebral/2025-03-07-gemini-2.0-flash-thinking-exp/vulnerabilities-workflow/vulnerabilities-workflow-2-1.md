## Vulnerability List

### 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chat History

* Description:
    The application stores chat history in the session and renders it on the user interface. User-provided input, specifically the question text, is directly embedded into the HTML structure of the chat history without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the chat history. When another user (or the same user on a subsequent visit if history persists and is replayed) views this history, the injected script will be executed in their browser, in the context of the application's origin.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Access the Cerebral application.
    2. In the chat input field, enter a malicious payload like: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3. Send the message by clicking the "Send" button or pressing Enter.
    4. Observe that the injected JavaScript `alert('XSS')` is executed when the chat history is rendered.

* Impact:
    * High
    * An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    * This can lead to:
        * **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information to impersonate the user.
        * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data visible to the user within the application.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or injecting malware.
        * **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page for the user.
        * **Performing actions on behalf of the user:** If the application has functionalities accessible via the UI, the attacker could potentially perform actions as the logged-in user.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The code directly embeds user input into HTML without any sanitization or encoding.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Input Sanitization:** Implement proper output encoding or sanitization for user-provided input before embedding it into HTML. For ReactJS, using React's built-in mechanisms for safe HTML rendering (like JSX with proper escaping) or a dedicated sanitization library is crucial. For Flask backend, ensure that when rendering templates, user inputs are properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the HTML response. In this specific case, when constructing the chat history HTML string in `app.py`, the `user_input` should be sanitized.

* Preconditions:
    * The attacker needs to be able to interact with the chat input field of the Cerebral application.
    * The application must render the chat history in a way that executes embedded scripts.

* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/code/rag-on-edge-cerebral/app.py`
    2. Function: `handle_button_click`
    3. Line: Inside `handle_button_click` function, the following line is responsible for adding the chat message to the session history:
       ```python
       session['history'].append(f"<span class='question'><B>{svg_client} Armando Blanco - Question: {user_input} </B></span><span class='answer'> {svg_server} Cerebral - Answer {answer}</span>")
       ```
    4. Analysis:
        * The `user_input` variable, which comes directly from `request.form.get('txtQuestion', '')`, is embedded into an HTML string using an f-string.
        * There is no HTML sanitization or encoding performed on `user_input` before embedding it.
        * When this HTML string is later rendered in the frontend (ReactJS application, based on project description, though UI code is not provided in PROJECT FILES), any JavaScript code within `user_input` will be executed by the browser.
    5. Visualization:
       ```
       UserInput (from request.form) --> [No Sanitization] --> HTML String Construction (f-string) --> session['history'] --> Frontend Rendering --> XSS Vulnerability
       ```

* Security test case:
    1. **Access the application:** Open the Cerebral application in a web browser (assuming it is deployed and accessible).
    2. **Open Developer Tools (Optional but Recommended):** Open browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) to observe network requests and JavaScript console.
    3. **Input XSS Payload:** In the chat input field, type the following payload: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`
    4. **Send the Message:** Click the "Send" button or press Enter to submit the message.
    5. **Observe the Alert:** An alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" should appear in the browser, demonstrating successful execution of the injected JavaScript code.
    6. **Inspect Chat History (Optional):** Inspect the HTML source of the chat history in the browser's developer tools. You should see the `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>` code directly embedded in the HTML.
