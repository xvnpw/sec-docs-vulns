### Vulnerability List for Cerebral Project

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure LLM Prompt for Database Query Generation leading to potential Data Exfiltration
* Description:
    1. The Cerebral application utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate natural language questions into InfluxDB queries.
    2. The prompt engineered for the LLM, as seen in `/code/code/cerebral-api/llm.py` (function `convert_question_query_influx`) and `/code/code/rag-on-edge-cerebral/app.py` (function `chat_with_openai_for_data`), may not be sufficiently robust to prevent the generation of malicious or unintended database queries.
    3. An attacker could craft a natural language query specifically designed to manipulate the LLM. This manipulation could result in the LLM generating InfluxDB queries that bypass intended access controls, potentially leading to the exfiltration of sensitive data.
    4. For instance, a crafted query might trick the LLM into listing all measurements, fields, or querying data beyond the user's authorized scope.
    5. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive telemetry data from the InfluxDB database.
* Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data: Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive manufacturing telemetry data stored within InfluxDB. This data may include production metrics, real-time equipment status, and critical operational parameters.
    - Data Exfiltration: Maliciously constructed queries could enable attackers to extract large volumes of data from InfluxDB, potentially leading to significant data breaches and compliance violations.
    - Information Disclosure: Exposure of sensitive information about the manufacturing process, operational efficiency, potential system vulnerabilities, and proprietary data can occur, harming competitive advantage and security posture.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include explicit mitigations for securing the LLM prompt or sanitizing generated database queries to prevent malicious exploitation. The system's security relies on the assumption that the LLM prompt is inherently secure and incapable of being manipulated into generating harmful queries.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust Prompt Engineering: Re-engineer the LLM prompt to be more restrictive and secure. The prompt should be meticulously designed and rigorously tested to minimize the possibility of prompt injection attacks leading to unintended or malicious query generation. It should enforce strict constraints on the types of queries the LLM can generate, ensuring they remain within the intended scope and adhere to defined access control policies.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization for Generated Queries: Implement a validation layer to inspect and sanitize the InfluxDB queries generated by the LLM before they are executed. This validation should parse the generated query, verify its structure, and ensure it conforms to pre-defined safe query patterns and access control rules. Any queries failing validation should be rejected.
    - Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access: Configure InfluxDB access with the principle of least privilege. Database user accounts used by the application should be granted only the minimum necessary permissions required for legitimate operations. This limits the potential damage even if a malicious query is successfully generated and executed.
    - Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on LLM prompt injection vulnerabilities and the security of database query generation. These tests should simulate various attack scenarios to identify weaknesses and validate the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to the Cerebral web application interface.
    - The attacker needs the ability to submit natural language queries to the system via the interface.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. Examine the function responsible for converting natural language questions to InfluxDB queries. This function is located in:
        - `/code/code/cerebral-api/llm.py` within the `LLM` class, function `convert_question_query_influx`.
        - or in the older version `/code/code/rag-on-edge-cerebral/app.py` within the function `chat_with_openai_for_data`.
    2. Analyze the prompt defined within this function. The prompt is designed to guide the LLM in generating InfluxDB queries.
    3. Observe that the prompt's design does not include explicit measures to prevent malicious query generation. It relies on the LLM's inherent behavior and prompt instructions to produce safe queries, which is not a secure approach.
    4. Trace the flow of the generated query. The generated query string is passed to functions that execute it against the InfluxDB database:
        - `/code/code/cerebral-api/InfluxDBHandler.py`, function `execute_query_and_return_data`.
        - or `/code/code/rag-on-edge-cerebral/app.py`, function `execute_query_and_return_data`.
    5. Confirm the absence of input sanitization or validation of the *generated InfluxDB query* before its execution. The system implicitly trusts the LLM to generate safe queries based solely on the provided prompt, creating a vulnerability.

    ```python
    # Example from /code/code/cerebral-api/llm.py (similar prompt exists in older version)
    def convert_question_query_influx(self, question):
        print("chat_with_openai_for_data")

        conversation = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": f"""
                User submits a query regarding the manufacturing process. Generate an InfluxDB query for data from the '{self.INFLUXDB_BUCKET}' bucket using the specified fields:
                ... (rest of the prompt) ...
                """
            }
        ]
        # ... rest of the function ...
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Access the Cerebral web application through its public interface.
    2. Submit a natural language query crafted to potentially exfiltrate sensitive data. Examples of such queries include:
        - "List all measurements in the InfluxDB database."
        - "Show me all fields and values from all measurements."
        - More targeted query: "Show me all values for all fields from the 'assemblyline' measurement."
    3. If possible, observe the InfluxDB query generated by the LLM. This might require access to application logs or enabling verbose mode if such an option exists in the application's configuration.
    4. Analyze the application's response. If the application returns a list of measurements, fields, or data exceeding the scope of a typical query (e.g., returning all data from a measurement when only a specific field was expected), it indicates a successful or potential vulnerability.
    5. To further validate the vulnerability, attempt to construct more sophisticated queries designed to dump large datasets or reveal schema information not intended for general access. For instance, if InfluxDB hypothetically contained a sensitive measurement like '_users', attempt a query such as "Show me users in InfluxDB" to assess if the LLM generates a query that tries to access this information, and if the application subsequently executes it and returns unauthorized data.
