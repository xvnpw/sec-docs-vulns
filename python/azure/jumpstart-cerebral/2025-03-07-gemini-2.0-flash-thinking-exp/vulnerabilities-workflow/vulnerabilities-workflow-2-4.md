### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability Name: InfluxDB Query Injection
* Description:
    1. A threat actor interacts with the Cerebral application through the web interface or API.
    2. The threat actor crafts a natural language question specifically designed to manipulate the generated InfluxDB query. For example, the question could be something like "Show me the Drive1 Speed') OR r['_measurement'] == 'unrelated_measurement' OR ('a'=='a".
    3. The Cerebral application uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to convert this natural language question into an InfluxDB query in the `LLM.py` file, specifically in the `convert_question_query_influx` function.
    4. If the LLM does not properly sanitize or validate the user input, it might generate an InfluxDB query that includes malicious InfluxQL code injected by the threat actor.
    5. The application then executes this crafted InfluxDB query against the InfluxDB database using the `InfluxDBHandler.py` file and the `execute_query_and_return_data` function.
    6. Due to the injected malicious InfluxQL code, the query could potentially retrieve more data than intended, modify data, or cause errors in the InfluxDB database depending on the injection.
* Impact:
    - Unauthorized Data Access: A threat actor could potentially bypass intended data access restrictions and retrieve sensitive information from the InfluxDB database that they are not authorized to view.
    - Data Manipulation: In more severe cases, depending on the capabilities of the injected InfluxQL and the permissions of the InfluxDB token used by the application, a threat actor might be able to modify or delete data within the InfluxDB database.
    - Information Disclosure: Error messages resulting from a malformed or injected query could reveal information about the database schema or internal application logic, aiding further attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no explicit input sanitization or validation mechanisms visible in the provided code snippets within the `LLM.py` or `InfluxDBHandler.py` files that would prevent InfluxDB query injection. The LLM is relied upon to generate "safe" queries, which is not a robust security mitigation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization on the natural language question before it is processed by the LLM. This could involve using regular expressions or parsing libraries to identify and remove or escape potentially malicious InfluxQL code.
    - Query Parameterization:  If possible with InfluxDB client libraries, use parameterized queries to separate user input from the query structure. This is a highly effective method to prevent injection attacks, but it's not clear if InfluxDB and the client library being used readily support full parameterization for all query parts generated by LLM.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that the InfluxDB token used by the Cerebral application has the minimum necessary permissions. Limit the token's access to only the specific buckets and operations required for the application's functionality. This would reduce the potential damage if an injection attack is successful.
    - Input Validation: Implement validation to check if the user's question is within the expected scope and complexity to prevent overly complex or unusual queries that might be more prone to injection or errors.
* Preconditions:
    - The Cerebral application must be deployed and accessible to the threat actor.
    - The application must be configured to use InfluxDB for time-series data, and the InfluxDB credentials must be configured in the application (as seen in environment variables in Dockerfiles and `app.py`).
    - The application must use the LLM to convert natural language questions into InfluxDB queries as described in the architecture.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/code/cerebral-api/llm.py` Function: `convert_question_query_influx`**:
        ```python
        def convert_question_query_influx(self, question):
            print("chat_with_openai_for_data")

            conversation = [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": f"""
                    User submits a query regarding the manufacturing process. Generate an InfluxDB query for data from the '{self.INFLUXDB_BUCKET}' bucket using the specified fields:
                    ... (rest of the prompt)
                    """
                }
            ]

            conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": question})

            response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
                    model=self.CHATGPT_MODEL,
                    messages=conversation
                )

            conversation.append({"role": "system", "content": response.choices[0].message.content})
            print(response.choices[0].message.content)

            clean_response = self.clean_string(response.choices[0].message.content)

            #return response.choices[0].message.content
            return clean_response
        ```
        - This function uses Azure OpenAI to generate InfluxDB queries based on user questions.
        - **Vulnerability**: The user-provided `question` is directly passed to the LLM prompt without any sanitization. The LLM is instructed to generate InfluxDB queries, but there's no guarantee that the generated query will be safe if the input question is crafted maliciously. The function then cleans the LLM response and returns it as the query to be executed.

    2. **File: `/code/code/cerebral-api/InfluxDBHandler.py` Function: `execute_query_and_return_data`**:
        ```python
        def execute_query_and_return_data(self, query):
            client = InfluxDBClient(url=self.INFLUXDB_URL, token=self.INFLUXDB_TOKEN, org=self.INFLUXDB_ORG)
            query_api = client.query_api(query_options=QueryOptions(profilers=["query", "operator"]))
            result = query_api.query(query=query)
            print("Query executed successfully")
            ... (rest of the function)
        ```
        - This function takes the `query` string, which is generated by the LLM in the previous step, and directly executes it using the InfluxDB client's `query_api.query(query=query)` method.
        - **Vulnerability**: The `query` variable, which could contain malicious InfluxQL code injected through the natural language question, is executed without any further validation or sanitization. This directly leads to the InfluxDB Query Injection vulnerability.

    **Visualization**:

    ```
    User Question (Maliciously crafted) --> Cerebral API (/api/convert_question_query_influx) --> LLM (convert_question_query_influx - No Sanitization) --> InfluxDB Query (Malicious InfluxQL) --> Cerebral API (/api/execute_influx_query) --> InfluxDBHandler (execute_query_and_return_data - Executes Unsanitized Query) --> InfluxDB (Vulnerable to Injection)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure the Cerebral application is running and accessible. You should be able to send POST requests to the `/api/convert_question_query_influx` and `/api/execute_influx_query` endpoints (or through the UI which uses these APIs).
    2. **Step 1**: Craft a malicious natural language question designed to inject InfluxQL code. For example: "Show me the Drive1 Speed') OR r['_measurement'] == 'unrelated_measurement' OR ('a'=='a". This is intended to bypass the intended measurement filter and potentially access data from other measurements or cause an error that reveals database information.
    3. **Step 2**: Send a POST request to the `/api/convert_question_query_influx` endpoint with the crafted question in the request body as JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "question": "Show me the Drive1 Speed') OR r['_measurement'] == 'unrelated_measurement' OR ('a'=='a"
        }
        ```
    4. **Step 3**: Examine the response from `/api/convert_question_query_influx`. The response should contain the InfluxDB query generated by the LLM. Verify if the generated query contains the injected InfluxQL code. It's expected to see something like:
        ```influxql
        from(bucket: "manufacturing") |> range(start: -1h) |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "assemblyline") |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "Drive1_Speed') OR r['_measurement'] == 'unrelated_measurement' OR ('a'=='a")
        ```
    5. **Step 4**: Take the generated InfluxDB query from the previous step and send it in a POST request to the `/api/execute_influx_query` endpoint:
        ```json
        {
            "query": "from(bucket: \"manufacturing\") |> range(start: -1h) |> filter(fn: (r) => r[\"_measurement\"] == \"assemblyline\") |> filter(fn: (r) => r[\"_field\"] == \"Drive1_Speed') OR r['_measurement'] == 'unrelated_measurement' OR ('a'=='a\")"
        }
        ```
    6. **Step 5**: Analyze the response from `/api/execute_influx_query`. If the vulnerability is present, the response might contain data from measurements other than "assemblyline" (if 'unrelated_measurement' exists and is accessible) or an error message from InfluxDB indicating a syntax error or unexpected behavior due to the injected code. Even if no extra data is returned due to InfluxDB security configurations, a successful injection is demonstrated if the query execution deviates from the intended behavior (e.g., errors out when it shouldn't for a normal query).
    7. **Expected Result**: The test should demonstrate that a malicious user can influence the generated InfluxDB query through natural language input, confirming the InfluxDB Query Injection vulnerability. Depending on the specific injection and database setup, this could lead to unauthorized data access or potentially data manipulation.
