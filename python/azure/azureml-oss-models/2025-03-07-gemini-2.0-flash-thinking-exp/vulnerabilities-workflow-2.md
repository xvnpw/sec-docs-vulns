# Vulnerabilities Found

## Malicious Content/Links Injection in HuggingFace Dashboard Generation

### Description
An attacker might try to inject malicious content or links into the HuggingFace dashboard generation process, if it dynamically incorporates external data without proper sanitization, to mislead users into downloading or using compromised models or resources when they rely on the dashboard for model discovery.

### Impact
Users who rely on the dashboard for model discovery and evaluation might be misled into downloading or using compromised models or resources. This could lead to execution of malicious code, data breaches, or supply chain attacks if the compromised models contain backdoors or vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently implemented mitigations
It's not explicitly mentioned if there are mitigations in place. Assuming no input sanitization is implemented for external data used in the dashboard generation process.

### Missing mitigations
- Input sanitization for any external data sources used to generate the HuggingFace dashboard. This should include sanitizing text, URLs, and any other data that is dynamically incorporated into the dashboard.
- Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the dashboard can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected malicious links.
- Input validation to ensure that data from external sources conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious code or scripts.

### Preconditions
- The dashboard generation process dynamically incorporates data from external sources (e.g., HuggingFace Hub, external APIs, user-provided inputs).
- This external data is not properly sanitized or validated before being used to generate the dashboard content.

### Source code analysis
Assuming the dashboard generation is written in Python and potentially uses a templating engine like Jinja or similar to create HTML dashboards.

```python
# Hypothetical vulnerable code snippet in dashboard generation script (e.g., dashboard_generator.py)

def generate_dashboard(model_info_source):
    # Assume model_info_source provides data from external source, e.g., HuggingFace API

    model_data = fetch_model_info(model_info_source) # Fetch data from external source

    dashboard_html = f"""
    <h1>Model Dashboard</h1>
    <h2>Model Name: {model_data['name']}</h2>
    <p>Description: {model_data['description']}</p>
    <p>Download Link: <a href="{model_data['download_url']}">Download Model</a></p>
    """
    return dashboard_html

# ... rest of the dashboard generation and serving logic ...
```

**Vulnerability:** If `model_data['description']` or `model_data['download_url']` are fetched from an unsanitized external source and contain malicious HTML or Javascript code, or point to a malicious URL, they will be directly embedded into the generated dashboard HTML.

**Exploit Scenario:**
1.  Attacker compromises an external data source that feeds into `model_info_source`.
2.  Attacker injects malicious HTML or Javascript code into the `description` field in the external data source. For example:
    ```
    <img src=x onerror="alert('Malicious Script Executed!')">
    ```
    Or, attacker replaces `download_url` with a link to a malicious file.
3.  When `generate_dashboard` function is executed and processes the compromised data, the malicious script or link is embedded into the `dashboard_html`.
4.  When a user views the generated dashboard, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, or they might be tricked into clicking on the malicious download link.

### Security test case
**Steps:**
1.  **Identify the external data source:** Analyze the dashboard generation scripts to determine where the model information is fetched from (e.g., HuggingFace API, configuration files, databases). Let's assume it's a mock external API for testing purposes.
2.  **Prepare malicious payload:** Create a malicious payload to inject. For example, a simple Javascript alert: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` or a malicious link: `<a href="https://malicious-website.com/malware.exe">Download Model</a>`.
3.  **Inject the payload into the external data source:**  If the external data source is controllable for testing purposes (e.g., a mock API or a test database), modify the data to include the malicious payload in a field that will be displayed on the dashboard (e.g., model description, model name). If interacting with a real HuggingFace Hub is part of the test scope (and permitted), attempt to inject the payload through any available input mechanisms (which is less likely to be directly exploitable in HuggingFace Hub itself, but possible in derived applications using its data). For the purpose of this test case, assume we can control a mock external API.
4.  **Trigger dashboard generation:** Access the dashboard application to trigger the dashboard generation process that uses the modified external data source.
5.  **Verify payload execution:**
    -   **For Javascript injection:** Check if the Javascript alert (`alert("XSS Vulnerability");`) is displayed in the browser when viewing the dashboard. Inspect the HTML source of the dashboard page to confirm that the injected script is present.
    -   **For malicious link injection:** Check if the "Download Model" link in the dashboard now points to `https://malicious-website.com/malware.exe` or the injected malicious URL.
6.  **Document findings:** If the payload is successfully executed or the malicious link is present, document the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, impact, and remediation recommendations (input sanitization, CSP, input validation).

**Expected result:**  Successful execution of the injected Javascript or presence of the malicious link in the dashboard, demonstrating the vulnerability.
