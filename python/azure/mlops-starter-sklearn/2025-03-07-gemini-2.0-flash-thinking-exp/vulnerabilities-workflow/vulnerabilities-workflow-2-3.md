- Vulnerability name: Insecure Storage of Credentials in `.env` Files
  - Description:
      - The project documentation (`docs/quickstart.md`) instructs users to configure environment variables by renaming `.env.sample` to `.env` and modifying it to include Azure Machine Learning workspace details such as resource group name, workspace name, location, and subscription ID.
      - These details, while not direct credentials like passwords or API keys, are sensitive workspace configuration information. If a user mistakenly commits the `.env` file containing these details to a public repository, it becomes accessible to anyone who can browse the repository.
      - An attacker could then use this information to probe the Azure Machine Learning workspace, potentially identifying further vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, or using it as a starting point for social engineering or targeted attacks against the Azure subscription.
  - Impact:
      - Medium. Exposure of Azure Machine Learning workspace and subscription configuration details.
      - Could lead to unauthorized reconnaissance of Azure resources.
      - Increases the risk of further attacks if other vulnerabilities exist in the Azure ML setup.
  - Vulnerability rank: Medium
  - Currently implemented mitigations:
      - The project provides `.env.sample` instead of a pre-filled `.env` file. This is a common practice to remind users not to commit sensitive information, but it is not a strong mitigation.
      - The `.gitignore` file is not provided in the project files, so it's not possible to confirm if `.env` is included there as a standard mitigation.
  - Missing mitigations:
      - Explicitly document the security risks of storing sensitive configuration details in `.env` files, especially for public repositories.
      - Strongly recommend using secure configuration management practices, such as environment variables set directly in the environment or using dedicated secret management services like Azure Key Vault for truly sensitive credentials.
      - Add `.env` to the project's `.gitignore` file (though not explicitly seen in provided files, this is a standard best practice).
  - Preconditions:
      - User follows the `docs/quickstart.md` guide to set up environment variables.
      - User stores Azure Machine Learning workspace details in the `.env` file.
      - User commits the `.env` file to a public Git repository.
  - Source code analysis:
      - `/code/docs/quickstart.md`:  The "Azure Machine Learning 上での環境変数の設定" section instructs users to "rename `.env.sample` ファイルを `.env` に改名します。" and "`.env` ファイルを開いて環境変数を設定します。". This instruction, while common for many projects, lacks explicit warning about the security implications of committing `.env` files, especially in public repositories.
      - `/code/.env.sample`: Contains placeholders for `GROUP`, `WORKSPACE`, `LOCATION`, and `SUBSCRIPTION`. These are examples of sensitive configuration details that should not be publicly exposed if possible.
  - Security test case:
      1. Fork the repository to a personal or organizational GitHub account.
      2. Follow the instructions in `docs/quickstart.md` to rename `.env.sample` to `.env`.
      3. Populate the `.env` file with example but realistic values for `GROUP`, `WORKSPACE`, `LOCATION`, and `SUBSCRIPTION`.
      4. Initialize a Git repository in the project directory if not already initialized by cloning.
      5. Add the `.env` file to the Git staging area using `git add .env`.
      6. Commit the `.env` file to the repository using `git commit -m "Commit .env file with workspace details"`.
      7. Push the commit to the forked public repository on GitHub.
      8. Make the repository public if it's currently private.
      9. Access the public repository on GitHub through a web browser or Git client.
      10. Browse the repository's file list and locate the committed `.env` file.
      11. Open and inspect the `.env` file. The Azure Machine Learning workspace details (GROUP, WORKSPACE, LOCATION, SUBSCRIPTION) will be visible in plain text, demonstrating the information exposure.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Exposure of Azure Credentials in GitHub Actions Workflow Logs
  - Description:
      - The `docs/quickstart.md` guide instructs users to create a GitHub Secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to store Azure service principal credentials for authenticating GitHub Actions workflows with Azure.
      - While using GitHub Secrets is the recommended approach for securely storing credentials in GitHub Actions, misconfiguration in workflows can lead to these secrets being unintentionally exposed in workflow execution logs.
      - For instance, if a workflow script is written to echo the value of `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for debugging purposes, or if verbose logging is enabled for Azure CLI commands that use the service principal, the secret might be printed in plain text within the workflow logs.
      - If workflow logs are accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., in public repositories or due to misconfigured permissions), these exposed credentials could be harvested and misused to gain unauthorized access to the associated Azure resources.
  - Impact:
      - High. Potential exposure of Azure Service Principal credentials (AZURE_CREDENTIALS).
      - Direct unauthorized access to Azure resources managed by the service principal.
      - Could lead to data breaches, resource manipulation, or other malicious activities within the Azure subscription.
  - Vulnerability rank: High
  - Currently implemented mitigations:
      - The documentation (`docs/quickstart.md`) correctly advises users to use GitHub Secrets for storing `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. This is the primary intended mitigation.
      - GitHub Secrets are designed to prevent secrets from being directly visible in workflow definitions and are masked in logs under normal circumstances.
  - Missing mitigations:
      - The project lacks example GitHub Actions workflow configurations that explicitly demonstrate secure handling of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and best practices to prevent accidental exposure in logs.
      - Documentation should include clear warnings and best practices for developers to avoid logging secrets, such as:
          - Never explicitly echo or print the content of secret variables in workflow scripts.
          - Avoid using verbose logging options for Azure CLI or other tools when commands involve secrets.
          - Review workflow logs carefully for any unintended secret exposure during development and testing.
          - Consider using tools or linters that can automatically scan workflow definitions and logs for potential secret leaks (though this is a general recommendation, not project-specific mitigation).
  - Preconditions:
      - User sets up GitHub Actions CI/CD as described in `docs/quickstart.md`.
      - User correctly configures the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub Secret.
      - GitHub Actions workflows are created or modified to include insecure logging or handling of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
      - Workflow execution logs are generated and are accessible to potential attackers (e.g., repository is public, or permissions are improperly set).
  - Source code analysis:
      - `/code/docs/quickstart.md`: The "GitHub Actions のシークレット作成" section guides users to create a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. It refers to external Azure documentation for details on setting up service principals and storing credentials as GitHub Secrets, which is generally secure if implemented correctly. However, the provided project files do not include any example GitHub Actions workflow files to verify secure secret handling practices within the project's context. We must assume potential insecure workflow configurations based on common developer errors.
      - Based on common insecure practices, a hypothetical vulnerable workflow step in a file like `.github/workflows/smoke-testing.yml` could be:
          ```yaml
          jobs:
            example_job:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
              - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3
              - name: Insecurely log credentials (Example of vulnerability)
                run: echo "Azure Credentials: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}" # INSECURE - DO NOT DO THIS
              - name: Azure Login (Potentially verbose logging)
                uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                  creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
                  enable-AzPSSession: true
                  allow-no-subscriptions: true
          ```
          In this example, the `Insecurely log credentials` step would directly print the secret to the logs. Even in the `Azure Login` step, if underlying Azure CLI commands used by the action have verbose logging enabled, there's a risk of secret leakage depending on how the action handles and masks secrets in verbose output.
  - Security test case:
      1. Fork the repository to a personal or organizational GitHub account.
      2. In the forked repository, create a new GitHub Secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and assign it a dummy JSON service principal credential value (e.g., `{"clientId": "dummy_client_id", "clientSecret": "dummy_client_secret", "subscriptionId": "dummy_subscription_id", "tenantId": "dummy_tenant_id"}`).
      3. Create a new workflow file in `.github/workflows/` directory, for example `test-secret-logging.yml`, with the following content to simulate insecure logging:
          ```yaml
          name: Test Secret Logging
          on: push
          jobs:
            log_secret:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - name: Checkout code
                  uses: actions/checkout@v3
                - name: Insecurely log AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret
                  run: echo "Printing AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
          ```
      4. Commit and push this workflow file to the forked repository.
      5. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the forked repository on GitHub and find the "Test Secret Logging" workflow run.
      6. Click on the workflow run to view its details, then click on the "log_secret" job.
      7. Inspect the job execution logs. You should observe that the dummy service principal credential value (or parts of it) is printed in the logs due to the `echo` command, demonstrating the potential for secret exposure if a real credential and similar insecure logging were used.
