- Vulnerability Name: Exposure of Azure Credentials in `.env` file via Git History
- Description:
    - The project instructs users to create a `.env` file at the root of the repository to store Azure Machine Learning workspace credentials as environment variables.
    - The `quickstart.md` documentation guides users to set up these credentials in the `.env` file.
    - If a user, by mistake or lack of awareness, removes or modifies the `.gitignore` rule that excludes `.env` files and subsequently commits the `.env` file to the Git repository, these sensitive credentials will be exposed in the Git history.
    - Once committed and pushed to a remote repository (like a public GitHub repository after forking), anyone with access to the repository's Git history can potentially view these credentials.
    - An attacker can then extract these credentials from the Git history.
- Impact:
    - If an attacker gains access to the Azure credentials, they can authenticate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - This unauthorized access allows the attacker to:
        - Manipulate or delete machine learning assets (datasets, models, environments, compute resources).
        - Modify or control ML pipelines, potentially injecting malicious code or data.
        - Access sensitive data stored within the Azure ML workspace.
        - Impersonate the service principal to perform actions within the Azure subscription, depending on the permissions assigned to the service principal.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project includes a `.gitignore` file at the root directory.
    - This `.gitignore` file contains an entry to exclude `.env` files from being tracked by Git:
        ```
        .env
        ```
    - This mitigation prevents users from accidentally adding `.env` files to their Git staging area and committing them, under normal circumstances.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit Warning in Documentation:** The documentation, specifically `quickstart.md`, should include a clear and prominent warning to users about the security risks of committing the `.env` file. This warning should advise users to ensure that the `.env` file is never committed to the Git repository and explain the purpose of the `.gitignore` rule.
    - **Pre-commit Hook to Check for `.env`:** Implement a pre-commit hook that automatically checks if a `.env` file is being added or modified in a commit. If detected, the hook should prevent the commit and display a warning message to the user, reinforcing the security best practice.
- Preconditions:
    - User follows the project's quickstart guide and creates a `.env` file to configure Azure credentials.
    - User, either intentionally or unintentionally, modifies or removes the `.gitignore` rule that excludes `.env` files.
    - User executes `git add .env` or `git add --all` and commits the changes, including the `.env` file, to the Git repository.
    - User pushes the commit to a remote Git repository, making the commit history (and the `.env` file) accessible to others depending on repository's visibility.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/README.md` and `/code/docs/quickstart.md`**: These files instruct users to create a `.env` file and set environment variables for Azure credentials. For example, `quickstart.md` says:
        ```
        - .env ファイルを開いて環境変数を設定します。
           - GROUP: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースのリソースグループ名
           - WORKSPACE: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースの名前
           - LOCATION: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースのリージョン
           - SUBSCRIPTION: Azure サブスクリプションID
        ```
    - **File: `/.gitignore`**: This file includes `.env`, which is intended to prevent accidental commits of this file.
        ```
        .env
        ```
    - **Vulnerability**: While `.gitignore` is present, there is no explicit warning in the documentation to reinforce the importance of not committing `.env` files. Users might unknowingly remove the `.gitignore` entry or fail to understand the risk if they are not security-conscious.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
        - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
        - Follow the instructions in `docs/quickstart.md` to create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with **dummy** Azure credentials (do not use real credentials). For example:
            ```
            GROUP="dummy_resource_group"
            WORKSPACE="dummy_workspace_name"
            LOCATION="dummy_location"
            SUBSCRIPTION="dummy_subscription_id"
            ```
        - **Simulate Misconfiguration:** Edit the `.gitignore` file in the root directory and remove the line `.env`. This simulates a user accidentally or intentionally removing the protection.
    2. **Commit and Push `.env`:**
        - Initialize a Git repository if not already initialized (it should be already initialized after cloning).
        - Stage the `.env` file: `git add .env`
        - Commit the staged `.env` file: `git commit -m "Accidentally committing .env file"`
        - Push the commit to your forked repository on GitHub: `git push origin main`
    3. **Verify Exposure:**
        - Go to your forked repository on GitHub in a web browser.
        - Navigate to the commit history.
        - Find the commit "Accidentally committing .env file".
        - Browse the files in this commit.
        - **Observe**: You will see that the `.env` file is now part of the repository's history, and its contents (the dummy credentials in this case) are exposed in plain text to anyone who can view the repository's history.
    4. **Clean up (Important):**
        - **Remove the `.env` file from the Git history.** This is crucial to prevent accidental exposure even with dummy credentials. Use tools like `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove the `.env` file from all commits and history.
        - **Restore `.gitignore`:** Re-add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file and commit the change to prevent future accidental commits.
