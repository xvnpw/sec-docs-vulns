### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Jinja2 Template Injection in Job Definitions

*   **Description:**
    The application uses Jinja2 templating to dynamically generate Databricks job definitions based on JSON files located in the `/jobs/` directory. The application reads these JSON files and directly passes their content to the Jinja2 `render()` function without any sanitization or input validation.
    An attacker who can modify or provide a malicious JSON job definition file can inject arbitrary Jinja2 template code. When the application processes this malicious file, the injected code will be executed by the Jinja2 engine. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the Databricks environment, effectively allowing the attacker to control the jobs created or managed by the application.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious JSON file containing Jinja2 template injection payloads within the job definition parameters (e.g., name, notebook path, parameters).
    2.  The attacker places this malicious JSON file into the `/jobs/` directory, making it accessible to the `job.py` script. This could be achieved through various means depending on the deployment environment, such as compromising the system where the script is run or through supply chain attacks if the jobs directory is populated from an external source.
    3.  The `job.py` script is executed.
    4.  The script reads the malicious JSON file from the `/jobs/` directory.
    5.  The script uses the Jinja2 template engine to render job definitions, passing the contents of the JSON file directly to the `template.render()` function.
    6.  The Jinja2 engine executes the injected malicious template code.
    7.  The attacker-controlled code is executed within the Databricks environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High/Critical:** Arbitrary code execution within the Databricks environment.
    *   An attacker can potentially gain full control over the Databricks workspace, depending on the permissions of the identity used by the application. This could include:
        *   Data exfiltration from Databricks.
        *   Data manipulation or deletion within Databricks.
        *   Execution of arbitrary Databricks jobs, potentially leading to resource abuse or further compromise of connected systems.
        *   Privilege escalation within the Databricks environment if the application's identity has elevated permissions.
    *   The severity is high as it allows for a complete compromise of the application's intended functionality and the security of the Databricks environment it manages.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly loads and processes JSON job definition files without any input validation or sanitization against template injection.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation for all data read from the JSON job definition files before passing it to the Jinja2 `render()` function. Sanitize or escape any potentially malicious characters or Jinja2 syntax.
    *   **Templating Language Restrictions:** If possible, restrict the Jinja2 environment to disallow potentially dangerous features that could be exploited for code execution. Consider using a sandboxed Jinja2 environment or a different templating engine that offers better security controls.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the identity used by the application to authenticate with Databricks has the minimum necessary permissions required for its intended functionality. This limits the impact of a successful template injection attack.
    *   **Secure File Handling:** Implement measures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the JSON job definition files. Verify the source and permissions of the `/jobs/` directory to prevent unauthorized modification or addition of malicious files.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to place or modify JSON files within the `/jobs/` directory accessible to the `job.py` script. This could happen if:
        *   The system running `job.py` is compromised.
        *   The `/jobs/` directory is not properly secured and is writable by unauthorized users.
        *   The job definition files are sourced from an untrusted external location.
    *   The `job.py` script must be executed to process the malicious JSON file.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **Job definition loading:**
        *   In `job.py`, the `main()` function reads JSON job definition files from the `/jobs/` directory:
            ```python
            target_jobs = [json.load(open(jobcfg)) for jobcfg in os.scandir('jobs') if(jobcfg.is_file() and jobcfg.path.endswith('.json'))]
            ```
        *   This code iterates through files in the `jobs` directory, filters for `.json` files, opens each file, and loads its content as JSON into the `target_jobs` list.

    2.  **Jinja2 template rendering:**
        *   The `main()` function gets the `standard.jinja2` template:
            ```python
            template = tplenv.get_template('standard.jinja2')
            ```
        *   It then iterates through `target_jobs` and renders the template for each job definition:
            ```python
            for x in target_jobs:
                task = template.render(job=x)
                result = post_db("jobs/create", task).json()
                log("Created a new job %s" % result['job_id'])
            ```
        *   Crucially, `template.render(job=x)` passes the entire JSON object `x` (which is loaded directly from the JSON file) as the `job` variable to the Jinja2 template.
        *   The `standard.jinja2` template (not provided, but based on README example) likely uses Jinja2 expressions like `{{ job.name }}`, `{{ job.notebookpath }}`, `{{ job.par_sourcesystem }}`, etc., to insert values from the `job` object into the Databricks job definition.
        *   Because the content of `target_jobs` comes directly from the JSON files and is passed to `template.render()` without any sanitization, any Jinja2 code injected into the JSON file will be executed during the rendering process.

    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    **Goal:** Prove that an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the Databricks environment by injecting Jinja2 template code into a JSON job definition file.

    **Preconditions for test:**
    *   A running instance of the `db-dsc-jobs` application with access to a Databricks workspace.
    *   Ability to place files in the `/jobs/` directory accessible to the application.

    **Steps:**
    1.  **Create a malicious JSON job definition file:**
        *   Create a file named `malicious_job.json` in the `/jobs/` directory with the following content. This example will attempt to execute the `whoami` command within the Databricks environment and include the output in the job name.  Note: the specific code execution payload might need to be adjusted depending on the Databricks environment and context of execution.  This example is demonstrative of injection.

            ```json
            {
              "name": "Injected Job - {{ execute('whoami') }}",
              "workers": 1,
              "notebookpath": "/Users/your_user@example.com/test_notebook",
              "description": "Malicious job definition with Jinja2 injection"
            }
            ```
            **Note:**  `execute('whoami')` is a placeholder.  The actual payload for code execution in a Jinja2 context might require using filters or extensions that are enabled in the Jinja2 environment.  For demonstration purposes, we assume a simplified injection to manipulate the job name. In a real-world scenario, more sophisticated payloads targeting specific Jinja2 features or available libraries within the execution context would be explored to achieve full code execution.  For a safer test without relying on specific Jinja2 extensions, you could try a simpler injection like `{{ range(1000000000) | list | count }}` to cause a delay or resource exhaustion as a proof of concept without arbitrary command execution if direct command execution is restricted.  However, for a clear demonstration of injection, manipulating the output is often sufficient as a first step.

        *   **Improved Test Case (Safer and more reliable for initial verification):** To reliably demonstrate injection without relying on potentially restricted functions, focus on manipulating output that is visibly reflected in Databricks.  Modify the `malicious_job.json` to inject a simple string that will be rendered in the job name:

            ```json
            {
              "name": "Injected Job - {{ 'INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL' }}",
              "workers": 1,
              "notebookpath": "/Users/your_user@example.com/test_notebook",
              "description": "Malicious job definition with Jinja2 injection"
            }
            ```

    2.  **Run the `job.py` script:**
        *   Execute the `job.py` script from the command line:
            ```bash
            python job.py --params params.json
            ```

    3.  **Verify the vulnerability in Databricks:**
        *   After the script executes, check the Databricks job list (either through the Databricks UI or using the Databricks API).
        *   Look for a newly created job named "Injected Job - INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL".
        *   If the job name contains "INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL", this confirms that the Jinja2 template injection was successful and the injected code (in this case, the string literal) was executed by the Jinja2 engine and inserted into the job definition.

    **Expected Result:**
    *   A new Databricks job will be created with a name that reflects the injected Jinja2 code, demonstrating successful template injection. In the improved test case, the job name should be "Injected Job - INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL".

This security test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute Jinja2 template code by providing a malicious JSON job definition file, confirming the Jinja2 template injection vulnerability.
