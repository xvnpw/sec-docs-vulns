### Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown Injection

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Markdown file. This file contains Markdown syntax that, when processed by co-op-translator, will be translated into HTML or JavaScript code.
    2. The attacker submits this malicious Markdown file to be translated using the co-op-translator tool. This can be done by placing the file in a project directory and running the tool on that directory.
    3. The co-op-translator processes the Markdown file, sending content to services like Azure OpenAI for translation.
    4. The translation service, unaware of the malicious intent, translates the entire content, including the injected malicious Markdown.
    5. The co-op-translator receives the translated content and writes it to a new Markdown file in the `translations` directory.
    6. When a user views the translated Markdown file (e.g., on a website that renders Markdown), the injected malicious HTML or JavaScript is executed by the user's web browser, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can inject malicious scripts (like JavaScript) into translated documentation.
    - When a user views the translated documentation in a web browser, the injected script can execute.
    - This can lead to various attacks, including:
        - Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
        - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        - Defacing the website displaying the documentation.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no mitigations implemented in the project to prevent malicious Markdown injection. The tool focuses on translation and formatting, not on sanitizing input against XSS.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The co-op-translator should sanitize the input Markdown content to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code before processing it. This could involve using a library that parses Markdown and escapes HTML entities or removes unsafe HTML/JavaScript elements.
    - Output sanitization: Even after translation, the translated Markdown output should be sanitized before being written to the output file to ensure that no malicious code is inadvertently introduced or passed through from the translation service.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious Markdown file as input to the co-op-translator.
    - The translated Markdown output must be rendered in a web browser or application that executes HTML or JavaScript embedded in Markdown.

- Source code analysis:
    - The code base does not include any explicit sanitization of Markdown input or output.
    - The `src/co_op_translator` directory contains the core logic for translation, but no files related to security or input validation were found in the provided project files.
    - The `translate_markdown` function in `src/co_op_translator/core/llm/markdown_translator.py` focuses on translation and formatting aspects but does not include steps for sanitizing against XSS.
    - The `update_links` function in `src/co_op_translator/utils/llm/markdown_utils.py` updates links in the markdown content but does not perform sanitization.
    - The `process_markdown` and `process_markdown_with_many_links` functions in `src/co_op_translator/utils/llm/markdown_utils.py` split the markdown content into chunks for translation but do not sanitize the content.
    - The code directly uses the output from the translation services and writes it to Markdown files without any sanitization step.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a new Markdown file named `malicious.md` with the following content:
    ```markdown
    # Malicious Markdown Example

    This is a heading.

    <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>

    [Malicious Link](javascript:alert('XSS from link'))

    ![Malicious Image](<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS from image')>)

    Normal text.
    ```
    2. Place this `malicious.md` file in a directory that will be processed by co-op-translator, for example, in the root directory or a subdirectory like `test_docs`.
    3. Run the co-op-translator command to translate this file to a target language, for example: `translate -l ko -r .` (if `malicious.md` is in the root directory).
    4. After the translation process completes, navigate to the `translations/ko` directory (or the target language directory you chose).
    5. Open the translated `malicious.md` file.
    6. Render or preview this `malicious.md` file in a Markdown viewer that supports HTML and JavaScript execution (e.g., a web browser rendering a GitHub page, or a Markdown preview extension in VS Code that allows script execution).
    7. Observe if the JavaScript `alert("XSS Vulnerability");` executes when the Markdown file is rendered. You should see an alert box pop up in your browser, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
    8. Check if the "Malicious Link" and "Malicious Image" also trigger JavaScript execution when interacted with or rendered, confirming further XSS vectors.
