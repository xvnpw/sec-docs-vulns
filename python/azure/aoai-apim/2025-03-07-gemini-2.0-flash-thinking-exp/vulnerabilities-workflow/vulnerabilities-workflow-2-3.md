### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Missing Authentication on API Management for Azure OpenAI Access
- Description:
    - An attacker attempts to access the publicly exposed Azure API Management endpoint.
    - The attacker sends a request to an API endpoint in API Management that is configured to forward requests to the backend Azure OpenAI service.
    - If API Management is not configured to enforce authentication for this specific API endpoint, the request is forwarded to the backend Azure OpenAI service without proper authentication of the client.
    - The backend Azure OpenAI service processes the request, potentially allowing unauthorized access and resource consumption.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure OpenAI service.
    - Consumption of Azure OpenAI resources, potentially leading to unexpected costs for the resource owner.
    - Exposure of sensitive data if the Azure OpenAI service processes or returns sensitive information, depending on the prompt and model used.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The provided documentation (README.md) mentions using Managed Identity for API Management to authenticate to Azure OpenAI. This secures the communication channel between APIM and AOAI. However, it does not explicitly detail or enforce authentication for external clients accessing API Management itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust authentication policies within Azure API Management to verify the identity of clients before allowing access to the Azure OpenAI proxy APIs. This could include:
        - API Key authentication: Require clients to include a valid API key in their requests.
        - OAuth 2.0 authentication: Integrate with an identity provider to authenticate users and authorize access using tokens.
        - Client certificate authentication: Require clients to present valid client certificates.
        - Azure Active Directory authentication: Leverage Azure AD for identity and access management.
- Preconditions:
    - An Azure API Management instance is deployed and publicly accessible over the internet.
    - An API within API Management is configured to act as a proxy, forwarding requests to a backend Azure OpenAI service.
    - No authentication policy is actively configured and enforced on the API Management API endpoint that proxies the Azure OpenAI service for external client access.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - No direct source code in the provided files configures the API Management policies. The `infra` directory containing the Bicep template, which would define these policies, is not included in the PROJECT FILES.
    - The README.md file describes the architecture and scaling strategies but does not contain specific configurations for API Management authentication.
    - Based on the documentation, the focus is on retry policies and routing, and there's no explicit mention or emphasis on setting up authentication for external clients accessing the API Management endpoints. This absence suggests a potential oversight in the default configuration, leaving room for misconfiguration where authentication might be unintentionally omitted.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Identify the publicly accessible endpoint URL of the deployed Azure API Management instance. This would typically be the 'Gateway URL' of the APIM service.
    2. Construct a sample API request targeting an Azure OpenAI endpoint that is supposed to be proxied by API Management. For example, if the APIM is set up to proxy the Azure OpenAI chat completion API, create a valid JSON request for chat completion (you can refer to Azure OpenAI API documentation for request format). Assume the API path in APIM is `/openai/deployments/{deployment-name}/chat/completions?api-version={api-version}`.
    3. Send this crafted API request to the API Management endpoint URL (identified in step 1) without including any authentication headers or credentials (e.g., without API key, Authorization header). Use a tool like `curl`, `Postman`, or a web browser's developer console to send the request.
    4. Analyze the HTTP response received from API Management.
        - If the response is a successful response from Azure OpenAI (e.g., HTTP status code 200 or 201 with a JSON response containing chat completion details), it confirms that the request was forwarded to Azure OpenAI without authentication. This indicates a **vulnerability**.
        - If the response is an HTTP error code related to authentication failure (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden) from API Management, it suggests that some form of authentication is configured, and the vulnerability is likely **mitigated**. Examine the error response details to understand the authentication mechanism in place.
