- Vulnerability Name: dateutil.parser.parse Vulnerability in StandardPythonParameterType
- Description: The `StandardPythonParameterType` uses `dateutil.parser.parse` to deserialize `datetime` and `time` types. `dateutil.parser.parse` is known to be lenient and can parse a wide range of date/time formats, some of which might be unexpected or lead to misinterpretation. This could potentially be exploited by providing maliciously crafted date/time strings to bypass intended validation or cause unexpected behavior in downstream applications. For example, if the application expects dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, `dateutil.parser.parse` might successfully parse dates in `MM/DD/YYYY` or even more ambiguous formats like `01-02-03`, interpreting them as `2003-01-02` or `2001-02-03` depending on the locale and heuristics, leading to incorrect data processing.
- Impact: Medium. Misinterpretation of date/time inputs could lead to incorrect data processing in the ML application, potentially affecting model predictions or application logic that depends on date/time information.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: None in `StandardPythonParameterType` regarding `dateutil.parser.parse` behavior. The code relies on the default behavior of `dateutil.parser.parse`.
- Missing mitigations: Implement more restrictive date/time parsing using `datetime.datetime.strptime` or `datetime.date.strptime` with specific, well-defined formats. Alternatively, validate the parsed date/time against expected ranges or formats after using `dateutil.parser.parse` to ensure it conforms to the application's requirements. Forcing a specific format would prevent ambiguity and reduce the risk of misinterpretation.
- Preconditions:
    - A web application uses the `inference-schema` library's `@input_schema` decorator with `StandardPythonParameterType` to define an endpoint that accepts `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.time` as input.
    - The application logic downstream from the decorator relies on the date/time input to be in a specific format or to represent a specific date/time value.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/inference_schema/parameter_types/standard_py_parameter_type.py`
    ```python
    from dateutil import parser
    class StandardPythonParameterType(AbstractParameterType):
        # ...
        def deserialize_input(self, input_data):
            # ...
            elif self.sample_data_type is datetime.datetime:
                input_data = parser.parse(input_data) # Vulnerable line: dateutil.parser.parse is used for parsing datetime
            elif self.sample_data_type is datetime.time:
                input_data = parser.parse(input_data).timetz() # Vulnerable line: dateutil.parser.parse is used for parsing time
            # ...
    ```
    - The `deserialize_input` method in `StandardPythonParameterType` uses `dateutil.parser.parse` for deserializing `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.time` inputs.
    - `dateutil.parser.parse` is known for its flexible parsing capabilities, which can be a security concern when specific date/time formats are expected by the application. An attacker could provide date/time strings in various formats, potentially leading to the parser misinterpreting the intended date/time.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Create a simple Python web application (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) that uses the `inference-schema` library.
        - Define an endpoint `/test_datetime` that is decorated with `@input_schema`.
        - In the `@input_schema` decorator, specify a parameter named `datetime_input` of type `StandardPythonParameterType` with a sample `datetime.datetime` object.
        - Inside the endpoint function, simply return the received `datetime_input` as a string in ISO format for verification.
    2. Test Request:
        - Send a POST request to `/test_datetime` with the following JSON payload:
        ```json
        {
            "datetime_input": "01/02/2024"
        }
        ```
        - This date string "01/02/2024" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as January 2nd or February 1st depending on the parsing logic.
    3. Expected Behavior:
        - Ideally, if the application expects `YYYY-MM-DD` format, this input should either be rejected or parsed as `2024-01-02` (if parsed as MM/DD/YYYY). However, `dateutil.parser` might interpret it differently based on locale settings or heuristics.
    4. Observed Behavior:
        - Observe the output from the `/test_datetime` endpoint. Check the format of the returned datetime string.
        - If the returned datetime string is not what is expected (e.g., if you expect `2024-01-02` but get `2024-02-01` or a different year or day), it indicates that `dateutil.parser.parse` has interpreted the ambiguous date string in an unexpected way.
    5. Vulnerability Confirmation:
        - If the observed behavior deviates from the expected behavior due to the ambiguous date/time parsing by `dateutil.parser.parse`, it confirms the vulnerability. This shows that an attacker can influence how date/time inputs are interpreted by providing ambiguous formats, potentially bypassing intended input validation or causing logical errors in the application.
