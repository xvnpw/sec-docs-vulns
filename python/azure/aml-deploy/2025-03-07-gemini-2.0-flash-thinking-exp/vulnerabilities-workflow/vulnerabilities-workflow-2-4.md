- Vulnerability Name: **Potential Code Injection in Test Script Execution**
- Description:
    - The GitHub Action allows users to specify a custom Python test script (`test_file_path`) and a function name (`test_file_function_name`) to execute tests against the deployed web service.
    - The action dynamically imports and executes the user-provided Python script using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and `spec.loader.exec_module`.
    - If a malicious user can modify the `test_file_path` to point to a script containing malicious code, this code will be executed within the GitHub Actions environment.
    - An attacker could potentially modify the test script through a Pull Request if they have write access to the repository or if a maintainer merges a malicious PR. Even without direct write access, an attacker might be able to influence the `test_file_path` indirectly if it's derived from user-controlled input, though in this action's current design, `test_file_path` is meant to be statically configured in the workflow or `deploy.json`.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker with write access to the repository (or via a malicious Pull Request merged by a maintainer) modifies the file specified by `test_file_path` (e.g., `code/test/test.py`) to include malicious Python code.
        2. The GitHub workflow is triggered (e.g., by a push or pull request).
        3. The `aml-deploy` action executes.
        4. The action dynamically imports and executes the modified test script using `importlib`.
        5. The malicious code within the test script is executed in the GitHub Actions runner environment.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions runner environment.
    - An attacker could potentially:
        - Steal secrets and credentials stored in the GitHub repository secrets.
        - Modify the deployment process to deploy backdoored models or services.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the repository or the Azure environment if the runner has access.
        - Disrupt the CI/CD pipeline.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The action itself does not implement specific mitigations against malicious test scripts.
    - The action relies on the user to provide a secure and trusted test script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: While the action validates parameters like Azure credentials and deployment parameters using JSON schemas, it does not perform any validation or sanitization on the content of the test script file.
    - **Sandboxed Execution Environment**: The test script is executed directly within the GitHub Actions runner environment. A sandboxed environment for executing user-provided test scripts could limit the impact of malicious code. However, this might be complex to implement in GitHub Actions.
    - **Static Analysis of Test Script**: Implement static analysis of the test script to detect potentially malicious code patterns before execution. This is also complex and might not catch all malicious scripts.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that the permissions granted to the service principal used by the GitHub Action are limited to the minimum required for deployment, reducing the potential impact if the runner is compromised. This is a general security best practice and not specific to test script vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the `test_file_path` or its contents in the repository. This could be through direct write access or by successfully merging a malicious Pull Request.
    - The `test_enabled` parameter in the action's configuration must be set to `true`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/code/main.py`

        - The code directly uses `importlib` to load and execute the Python script specified by `test_file_path`. There are no checks on the content or safety of this script.
- Security Test Case:
    - Precondition: You have write access to a repository using this GitHub Action, or can create a Pull Request.
    - Steps:
        1. In your repository, modify the test script file (default: `code/test/test.py`) to include malicious Python code. For example, to exfiltrate repository secrets, you could add the following to `code/test/test.py`:
            ```python
            import os
            def main(webservice):
                # Example malicious code to print GitHub secrets to logs (for demonstration - in real attack exfiltrate)
                print(f"::warning:: EXFILTRATING SECRET: ${{secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS}}")
                # ... rest of your test script ...
                pass
            ```
        2. Ensure `test_enabled: true` is set in your `deploy.json` or workflow configuration.
        3. Trigger the GitHub workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit).
        4. Check the GitHub Actions workflow logs for the `aml-deploy` action's job.
        5. If the malicious code was successfully injected and executed, you will see the output of the malicious code in the logs (in this example, the content of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be printed as a warning, though secrets are usually masked, more sophisticated exfiltration might be possible).
    - Expected Result: The malicious Python code embedded in the test script is executed by the GitHub Action, demonstrating code injection vulnerability. In a real scenario, an attacker could perform more harmful actions.
