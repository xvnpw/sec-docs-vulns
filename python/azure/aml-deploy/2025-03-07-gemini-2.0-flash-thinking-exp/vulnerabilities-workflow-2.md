## Combined List of High and Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Unsafe Execution of User-Provided `score.py` Inference Script

- **Description:**
    1. The GitHub Action deploys a Machine Learning model endpoint using a user-provided `score.py` script.
    2. This `score.py` script defines the `init()` and `run(data)` functions, which handle model loading and inference logic, respectively.
    3. The `run(data)` function processes input data sent to the deployed endpoint.
    4. A malicious user can craft a payload and send it to the deployed endpoint.
    5. If the `score.py` script contains vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, command injection, path traversal, insecure deserialization, etc.) and doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input `data`, the malicious payload can exploit these vulnerabilities.
    6. This exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the endpoint's container, information disclosure, or unauthorized actions within the endpoint environment.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Arbitrary code execution within the deployed endpoint's container.
    - **High:** Information disclosure, potentially including sensitive data accessible within the endpoint environment.
    - **Medium:** Unauthorized actions within the endpoint environment, such as modifying data or resources accessible to the endpoint.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation Schemas:** The action uses JSON schemas (`schemas.py`) to validate the `azure_credentials` and `parameters_file`. However, these schemas do not validate the content of the user-provided `score.py` script or the input data processed by it.
    - **Containerization:** The `score.py` script runs within a Docker container, which provides some level of isolation from the host system. However, containerization alone is not sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities within the application running in the container.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation in `score.py` Documentation:** The documentation should strongly emphasize the critical importance of input sanitization and validation within the user-provided `score.py` script. It should provide guidelines and best practices for developers to secure their inference scripts against malicious inputs.
    - **Example Secure `score.py` Script:**  Providing a secure example `score.py` script that demonstrates input validation and sanitization techniques would be beneficial for users.
    - **Static Code Analysis for `score.py` (Optional):** While difficult to enforce universally, suggesting or integrating static code analysis tools to scan user-provided `score.py` scripts for potential vulnerabilities could be a valuable enhancement. This would likely be an advanced feature or recommendation rather than a mandatory mitigation within the GitHub Action itself.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must have knowledge of the deployed model endpoint's URI.
    2. The user must have deployed a model endpoint using this GitHub Action with a `score.py` script that contains exploitable vulnerabilities due to insufficient input handling.
    3. The deployed endpoint must be publicly accessible or accessible to the attacker through other means.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`action.yml` and `main.py`:** These files are responsible for setting up the deployment environment and deploying the model using Azure ML SDK. They do not directly handle the execution of the `score.py` script or the input data. The vulnerability lies within the user-controlled `score.py` script.
    - **`code/tests/deploy/score.py` (Example):**
        ```python
        def run(data):
            # Use the model object loaded by init().
            result = model.predict(data)
            # ...
            return {"predict": result.tolist()}
        ```
        - The `run(data)` function directly passes the input `data` to the `model.predict()` function.
        - If the `model.predict()` function or any custom logic within `score.py` is vulnerable to certain types of input (e.g., specially crafted NumPy arrays, strings, or JSON payloads), it can be exploited.
        - **No Input Validation:** The provided example `score.py` does not include any explicit input validation or sanitization of the `data` variable before passing it to the model. This lack of validation is the root cause of the vulnerability.
        - **Dependency on User Code:** The security of the deployed endpoint is heavily dependent on the security practices implemented in the user-provided `score.py` script, which is outside the control of this GitHub Action.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy a model endpoint using this GitHub Action.
        - Create a deliberately vulnerable `score.py` script for testing purposes. For example, a `score.py` that attempts to execute shell commands based on input data (for demonstration, **do not use in production**):
          ```python
          import subprocess
          import json

          def init():
              pass

          def run(data):
              try:
                  command = data.get('command')
                  if command:
                      result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
                      return {"output": result.stdout, "error": result.stderr}
                  else:
                      return {"message": "No command provided"}
              except Exception as e:
                  return {"error": str(e)}
          ```
        - Deploy this model using the GitHub Action, ensuring the `inference_entry_script` in `deploy.json` points to this malicious `score.py`.
    2. **Steps to Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Obtain the scoring URI of the deployed service from the GitHub Action output (`service_scoring_uri`).
        - Use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to send a POST request to the scoring URI with a malicious JSON payload.
        - Example malicious payload to attempt command execution:
          ```json
          {
              "data": {
                  "command": "ls -la /app"
              }
          }
          ```
        - Send the request:
          ```bash
          curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": {"command": "ls -la /app"}}' <service_scoring_uri>
          ```
    3. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Case):**
        - The endpoint will execute the command `ls -la /app` within the container.
        - The response from the endpoint will contain the output of the executed command in the `output` field, demonstrating command execution vulnerability.
        - In a real-world scenario, attackers could use this to execute more harmful commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or compromising the endpoint environment.

### 2. Insecure Model Endpoint Exposure due to Disabled Authentication

- **Description:**
  - The Azure Machine Learning Deploy GitHub Action allows users to deploy machine learning models as web service endpoints on Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - By default, when deploying to ACI, the `authentication_enabled` parameter is set to `false`. This configuration can also be explicitly set by the user in the `deploy.json` parameters file or through action inputs.
  - When `authentication_enabled` is false, the deployed web service endpoint is publicly accessible without any authentication required.
  - An attacker can discover the scoring URI of the deployed service (which is outputted by the GitHub Action as `service_scoring_uri`).
  - The attacker can then send requests to this URI to query the machine learning model and obtain predictions without any authorization.
  - This is done by sending a POST request to the scoring URI with input data in the format expected by the model.

- **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized access to the machine learning model deployed as a web service.
  - Confidentiality breach of the machine learning model and its prediction logic.
  - Potential misuse of the machine learning model for malicious purposes.
  - Data exfiltration if the model processes or reveals sensitive information in its predictions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - For AKS deployments, `authentication_enabled` defaults to `true`, enabling key-based authentication by default.
  - The documentation in `README.md` mentions the `authentication_enabled` parameter and its default values for ACI and AKS.
  - The documentation implicitly warns about the risk by stating "Whether or not to enable key auth for this Webservice." and providing default values.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Stronger Warning in Documentation:** The documentation should explicitly highlight the security risk of disabling authentication for ACI deployments and recommend enabling authentication for production environments.
  - **Default to Secure Configuration for ACI:** Consider changing the default value of `authentication_enabled` to `true` for ACI deployments to enforce authentication by default. Alternatively, provide a clear and prominent warning during ACI deployment when authentication is disabled.
  - **Security Best Practices Guidance:** Include a section in the documentation outlining security best practices for deploying ML models, emphasizing the importance of authentication and authorization.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The user must deploy a machine learning model using the Azure Machine Learning Deploy GitHub Action.
  - The deployment must be to Azure Container Instances (ACI).
  - The `authentication_enabled` parameter must be set to `false` (either explicitly or by default).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **`action.yml`:** Defines the inputs for the GitHub Action, including parameters related to deployment.
  - **`README.md`:** Documents the usage of the action and describes the `authentication_enabled` parameter, noting the default value for ACI as `false` and AKS as `true`. It also mentions the parameter description "Whether or not to enable key auth for this Webservice."
  - **`code/main.py`:**
    - The `main()` function reads the `authentication_enabled` parameter from the `parameters` dictionary, which is loaded from the `deploy.json` file or defaults.
    - For ACI deployments, the `AciWebservice.deploy_configuration()` function is called.
    - ```python
      deployment_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(
          # ... other parameters ...
          auth_enabled=parameters.get("authentication_enabled", None),
          # ... other parameters ...
      )
      ```
    - The `auth_enabled` parameter in `AciWebservice.deploy_configuration()` directly controls whether authentication is enabled for the deployed ACI web service.
    - If `parameters.get("authentication_enabled", None)` evaluates to `None` or `False`, and no environment variable overrides it, the ACI endpoint will be deployed without authentication, as the default for ACI in Azure ML SDK is to disable authentication.
    - The code does not enforce authentication or provide any warnings if authentication is disabled for ACI deployments.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - Step 1: Create a `deploy.json` file in your repository (e.g., `.cloud/.azure/deploy.json`) with the following content to explicitly disable authentication for ACI deployment:
    ```json
    {
      "authentication_enabled": false
    }
    ```
  - Step 2: Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to use the `Azure/aml-deploy@v1` action to deploy a registered model to ACI. Ensure that the workflow uses the `deploy.json` file created in Step 1.
  - Step 3: Run the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the deployment is successful, note the `service_scoring_uri` output from the `aml-deploy` action.
  - Step 4: Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the `service_scoring_uri` without providing any authentication keys or tokens. For example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [[1,2,3,4]]}' <service_scoring_uri>
    ```
    Replace `<service_scoring_uri>` with the actual scoring URI obtained from the GitHub Actions output. The input data `{"data": [[1,2,3,4]]}` is a sample input; adjust it based on the expected input format of your deployed model.
  - Step 5: Observe the response. If the vulnerability exists, the request will be successful, and you will receive a prediction from the machine learning model without any authentication. This confirms that the endpoint is publicly accessible and vulnerable to unauthorized access.

### 3. Exposure of Azure Credentials through GitHub Secrets

- **Description:**
    - An attacker who gains unauthorized access to a GitHub repository's secrets can retrieve the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - This secret contains sensitive Azure service principal credentials, including `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId`.
    - With these credentials, the attacker can authenticate to the victim's Azure subscription and resource group.
    - Once authenticated, the attacker can leverage the "Contributor" role associated with the service principal to interact with Azure resources, specifically the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - The attacker can then deploy malicious machine learning models to the victim's Azure Machine Learning workspace using the compromised credentials and the `aml-deploy` action or directly via Azure SDK/CLI.

- **Impact:**
    - **Unauthorized Access to Data:** Malicious models deployed by the attacker could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by the Azure Machine Learning workspace or access other data within the Azure environment.
    - **Service Disruption:** Attackers can replace legitimate models with malicious or malfunctioning ones, disrupting critical services that rely on these models. This can lead to incorrect predictions, system failures, and reputational damage.
    - **Resource Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to manipulate other Azure resources within the resource group, potentially leading to further security breaches, denial of service, or unexpected financial costs for the victim.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Secret Masking:** The `mask_parameter` function in `code/utils.py` is used in `code/main.py` to mask the `azure_credentials` (tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, subscriptionId) in the GitHub Action logs. This prevents accidental exposure of the secret in logs.
    - **Documentation on Secret Management:** The `README.md` file provides instructions on how to create and store `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` as a GitHub secret, guiding users towards secure secret management practices within GitHub Actions.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secret Rotation Policy:** The project lacks guidance or mechanisms for regular rotation of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. Implementing a secret rotation policy would reduce the window of opportunity if the secret is compromised.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for Service Principal:** The documentation recommends granting the "Contributor" role to the service principal at the resource group scope. This might be overly permissive. The principle of least privilege should be applied by recommending a custom role with only the necessary permissions for deploying models within the specific Azure Machine Learning workspace, limiting the potential impact of credential compromise.
    - **GitHub Secret Scanning Awareness:** The documentation does not mention or encourage users to utilize GitHub's secret scanning feature or similar tools to proactively detect accidental commits or exposure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim organization uses the `aml-deploy` GitHub Action in their CI/CD workflows to automate model deployment to Azure Machine Learning.
    - The victim has correctly configured the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in their GitHub repository as per the action's documentation.
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GitHub repository's secrets. This could be due to various reasons, including but not limited to: compromised developer accounts, vulnerabilities in GitHub's platform, or insider threats.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`code/main.py` - Secret Loading and Masking:**
        - Line 39: `azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")` - The action retrieves the Azure credentials from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which is expected to be set by GitHub Actions from the repository's secrets.
        - Line 58-61: `mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))`, `mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))`, `mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))`, `mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))` -  The code utilizes the `mask_parameter` function from `utils.py` to mask the sensitive parts of the `azure_credentials` in the logs. This is a positive security measure to prevent accidental logging of the secret.
    2. **`code/utils.py` - Masking Implementation:**
        - Line 17-18: `def mask_parameter(parameter):` and `print(f"::add-mask::{parameter}")` - The `mask_parameter` function uses the GitHub Actions command `::add-mask::` to instruct the Actions runner to mask the provided `parameter` in the logs. This mitigation is in place to reduce the risk of secret leakage through logs.
    3. **`action.yml` - Input Definition:**
        - Inputs section: `azure_credentials` input is defined with `required: true` and description guiding users to store the output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` as a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. This highlights the reliance on GitHub secrets for secure credential injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a private GitHub repository to simulate a victim's repository.
        - Set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace (can be a trial or sandbox workspace for testing).
        - Create an Azure service principal with "Contributor" role at the resource group level of the AML workspace.
        - In the GitHub repository, configure `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` as a repository secret, pasting the JSON output from `az ad sp create-for-rbac ...`.
        - Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/test-secret-exposure.yml`) that uses the `aml-deploy` action. The workflow should be triggered manually.
        - Add an additional step in the workflow definition after the `aml-deploy` action step. This step will attempt to explicitly print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the logs to verify if it's accessible within the workflow context (for demonstration purposes only, not recommended in production). A safer alternative for verification is to attempt an authenticated Azure operation.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Manually trigger the `Test Secret Exposure` workflow in the GitHub repository.
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Check Workflow Logs:** Examine the logs of the "Attempt Secret Access" step. While the `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` value might be masked by GitHub Actions in the logs UI, the step itself executes within the workflow environment and has access to the secret. The "Verify Azure Authentication" step will confirm if the credentials can be used to successfully authenticate with Azure.
        - **Simulate Attacker Access:** Imagine an attacker who has gained read access to the repository's workflows and logs (e.g., through compromised CI/CD pipeline or monitoring tools). They could potentially reconstruct or infer the secret value or directly use the workflow environment to perform actions using the compromised credentials.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The "Verify Azure Authentication" step should succeed, demonstrating that the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, when configured for the `aml-deploy` action, is indeed accessible within the workflow run environment. This confirms that if an attacker compromises the GitHub repository's secrets, they can retrieve and misuse these Azure credentials to perform actions in the victim's Azure subscription, including deploying malicious models as described in the vulnerability description.

### 4. Potential Code Injection in Test Script Execution

- **Description:**
    - The GitHub Action allows users to specify a custom Python test script (`test_file_path`) and a function name (`test_file_function_name`) to execute tests against the deployed web service.
    - The action dynamically imports and executes the user-provided Python script using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and `spec.loader.exec_module`.
    - If a malicious user can modify the `test_file_path` to point to a script containing malicious code, this code will be executed within the GitHub Actions environment.
    - An attacker could potentially modify the test script through a Pull Request if they have write access to the repository or if a maintainer merges a malicious PR. Even without direct write access, an attacker might be able to influence the `test_file_path` indirectly if it's derived from user-controlled input, though in this action's current design, `test_file_path` is meant to be statically configured in the workflow or `deploy.json`.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker with write access to the repository (or via a malicious Pull Request merged by a maintainer) modifies the file specified by `test_file_path` (e.g., `code/test/test.py`) to include malicious Python code.
        2. The GitHub workflow is triggered (e.g., by a push or pull request).
        3. The `aml-deploy` action executes.
        4. The action dynamically imports and executes the modified test script using `importlib`.
        5. The malicious code within the test script is executed in the GitHub Actions runner environment.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**: Arbitrary code execution within the GitHub Actions runner environment.
    - An attacker could potentially:
        - Steal secrets and credentials stored in the GitHub repository secrets.
        - Modify the deployment process to deploy backdoored models or services.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the repository or the Azure environment if the runner has access.
        - Disrupt the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The action itself does not implement specific mitigations against malicious test scripts.
    - The action relies on the user to provide a secure and trusted test script.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: While the action validates parameters like Azure credentials and deployment parameters using JSON schemas, it does not perform any validation or sanitization on the content of the test script file.
    - **Sandboxed Execution Environment**: The test script is executed directly within the GitHub Actions runner environment. A sandboxed environment for executing user-provided test scripts could limit the impact of malicious code. However, this might be complex to implement in GitHub Actions.
    - **Static Analysis of Test Script**: Implement static analysis of the test script to detect potentially malicious code patterns before execution. This is also complex and might not catch all malicious scripts.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that the permissions granted to the service principal used by the GitHub Action are limited to the minimum required for deployment, reducing the potential impact if the runner is compromised. This is a general security best practice and not specific to test script vulnerability.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the `test_file_path` or its contents in the repository. This could be through direct write access or by successfully merging a malicious Pull Request.
    - The `test_enabled` parameter in the action's configuration must be set to `true`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/code/main.py`
    - Lines relevant to vulnerability:
        ```python
        if parameters.get("test_enabled", False):
            # Testing service
            print("::debug::Testing service")
            root = os.environ.get("GITHUB_WORKSPACE", default=None)

            try:
                test_function(service)
            except TypeError as exception:

                raise AMLDeploymentException(f"The webservice tests did not complete successfully: {exception}")
        ```
        - The code directly uses `importlib` to load and execute the Python script specified by `test_file_path`. There are no checks on the content or safety of this script.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Precondition: You have write access to a repository using this GitHub Action, or can create a Pull Request.
    - Steps:
        1. In your repository, modify the test script file (default: `code/test/test.py`) to include malicious Python code. For example, to exfiltrate repository secrets, you could add the following to `code/test/test.py`:
            ```python
            import os
            def main(webservice):
                # Example malicious code to print GitHub secrets to logs (for demonstration - in real attack exfiltrate)
                print(f"::warning:: EXFILTRATING SECRET: ${{secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS}}")
                # ... rest of your test script ...
                pass
            ```
        2. Ensure `test_enabled: true` is set in your `deploy.json` or workflow configuration.
        3. Trigger the GitHub workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit).
        4. Check the GitHub Actions workflow logs for the `aml-deploy` action's job.
        5. If the malicious code was successfully injected and executed, you will see the output of the malicious code in the logs (in this example, the content of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be printed as a warning, though secrets are usually masked, more sophisticated exfiltration might be possible).

- **Expected Result:** The malicious Python code embedded in the test script is executed by the GitHub Action, demonstrating code injection vulnerability. In a real scenario, an attacker could perform more harmful actions.
