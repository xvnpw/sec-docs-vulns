- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Device Credentials

- Description:
    1. The sample code and documentation instruct users to store device credentials (DeviceKey, GroupKey, certificate paths, certificate passphrase) in a plain text file named `samples.ini`.
    2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where the `samples.ini` file is located. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system, social engineering, or physical access if the device is locally accessible.
    3. The attacker opens and reads the `samples.ini` file.
    4. The attacker extracts sensitive device credentials, including DeviceKey, GroupKey, certificate file paths, and certificate passphrases, which are stored in plain text within the configuration file.
    5. With these compromised credentials, the attacker can now impersonate the legitimate device.
    6. The attacker can use the `iotc` library or any compatible tool with the stolen credentials to connect to the Azure IoT Central application.
    7. Once connected as the impersonated device, the attacker can perform malicious actions, such as sending fabricated telemetry data, manipulating device properties, and intercepting or interfering with commands intended for the actual device.

- Impact:
    - **Device Impersonation**: Attackers can fully impersonate legitimate devices in Azure IoT Central.
    - **Data Breach**: Sensitive device credentials are exposed, potentially leading to further compromise.
    - **Telemetry Manipulation**: Attackers can send false telemetry data, leading to incorrect dashboards, alerts, and analytics in IoT Central.
    - **Unauthorized Device Control**: Attackers could potentially manipulate device properties or send commands, disrupting device operation or causing unintended actions.
    - **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity**: The confidentiality of device credentials and the integrity of telemetry data are compromised.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Disclaimer in `README.md`: The `README.md` file contains disclaimers stating that the library is experimental and not recommended for production use. This serves as a weak, indirect mitigation by discouraging the use of this library in security-sensitive environments. However, it does not prevent users from insecurely storing credentials if they choose to use the library.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure Credential Storage Guidance: The project lacks clear and prominent warnings against storing credentials in plain text files. It should strongly advise users to use secure storage mechanisms.
    - Secure Configuration Examples: The samples should be modified to demonstrate loading credentials from more secure sources, such as environment variables, secure configuration management systems, or key vaults.
    - Input Validation for Configuration: While not directly related to storage, implementing input validation for configuration files could also be a beneficial security practice.
    - Removal of Insecure Default: The `samples.ini` example should be removed or replaced with a more secure default configuration approach to prevent users from inadvertently adopting insecure practices.

- Preconditions:
    - User follows the sample configuration and stores device credentials in the `samples.ini` file.
    - Attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where the `samples.ini` file is stored.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **README.md and Samples**: The `README.md` file, under the "Samples" section, explicitly instructs users to create a `samples.ini` file and provides an example of storing credentials (ScopeId, DeviceId, DeviceKey, GroupKey, CertFilePath, KeyFilePath, CertPassphrase) in plain text within this file.
    - **samples/async_device_key.py, samples/async_x509.py, samples/sync_device_key.py, samples/sync_x509.py**: These sample scripts utilize the `configparser` library to read configuration data directly from the `samples.ini` file. For instance, `configparser.ConfigParser().read(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'samples.ini'))` directly loads and parses the INI file, making the plain text credentials accessible within the scripts.
    - **No Secure Storage Mechanisms**: The provided code and samples do not include any mechanisms for secure credential storage or retrieval. The default and suggested method is to use a plain text INI file.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Clone the GitHub repository containing the `iotc-python-client` library.
        - Navigate to the `samples` directory.
        - Create a `samples.ini` file within the `samples` directory, as instructed in the `README.md`.
        - Populate the `samples.ini` file with device credentials (e.g., DeviceKey, DeviceId, ScopeId) in plain text, following the example provided in the `README.md`.
        - Install the `iotc` library and dependencies using `pip install iotc`.
        - Choose one of the sample scripts (e.g., `samples/async_device_key.py`) and ensure it is configured to use the credentials from `samples.ini`.
        - Run the sample script to verify that the device connects to Azure IoT Central and sends telemetry.
    2. **Attacker Access**:
        - As an attacker, simulate gaining unauthorized access to the file system where the `samples.ini` file is located. For example, if testing locally, this is simply file system access. In a real-world scenario, this could represent gaining access to a server or device through other vulnerabilities.
    3. **Credential Extraction**:
        - Open the `samples.ini` file using a text editor or command-line tool.
        - Observe that the device credentials (DeviceKey, DeviceId, ScopeId, etc.) are stored in plain text and easily readable.
        - Copy the `DeviceKey` and `DeviceId`.
    4. **Device Impersonation**:
        - Create a new Python script (or modify an existing one) on a separate attacker-controlled machine.
        - Install the `iotc` library on the attacker machine: `pip install iotc`.
        - In the attacker script, import the `iotc` library and use the `IoTCClient` to create a new client instance.
        - Configure the `IoTCClient` with the stolen `DeviceKey`, `DeviceId`, and `ScopeId` extracted from `samples.ini`. Use `IOTCConnectType.IOTC_CONNECT_DEVICE_KEY` for connection type.
        - Write code in the attacker script to connect to Azure IoT Central using the `client.connect()` method.
        - Add code to send telemetry data using `client.send_telemetry({'attack': 'true'})`.
        - Run the attacker script.
    5. **Verification**:
        - Access the Azure IoT Central application associated with the `ScopeId` used in `samples.ini`.
        - Navigate to the device management section and locate the `DeviceId` that was impersonated.
        - Monitor the telemetry data for this device.
        - Verify that telemetry data with the 'attack': 'true' payload, sent from the attacker's script, is visible in Azure IoT Central for the impersonated device. This confirms successful device impersonation using the stolen credentials from `samples.ini`.
