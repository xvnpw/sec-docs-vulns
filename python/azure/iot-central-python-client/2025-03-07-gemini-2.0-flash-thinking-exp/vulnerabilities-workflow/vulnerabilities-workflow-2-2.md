#### 1. Insecure Storage of Device Credentials in Configuration File

- **Description:**
    1. The library's sample code and documentation instruct users to store device credentials, such as symmetric keys, X.509 certificate paths, and passphrases, in a plaintext configuration file named `samples.ini`.
    2. The `samples.ini` file is intended to be placed in the `samples` directory of the project.
    3. Example scripts, like `async_device_key.py` and `async_x509.py`, are provided in the `samples` directory and are configured to read device credentials directly from this `samples.ini` file using the `configparser` library.
    4. If a developer using this library inadvertently exposes the `samples.ini` file (e.g., by committing it to a public version control repository, hosting it on a public web server, or through insecure file sharing), an attacker can easily access and retrieve the plaintext device credentials.
    5. With these stolen credentials, an attacker can then impersonate the legitimate device and connect to the associated Azure IoT Central application.

- **Impact:**
    - **Device Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate the compromised device, sending fabricated or malicious telemetry data to Azure IoT Central, potentially disrupting application logic, skewing analytics, or triggering false alerts.
    - **Unauthorized Device Control:** Depending on the IoT Central application's configuration, an attacker might be able to send commands to the impersonated device, potentially causing it to malfunction, perform unintended actions, or be used as a vector for further attacks.
    - **Data Breach:** In scenarios where device telemetry contains sensitive information, an attacker gaining control of the device stream could intercept or manipulate this data, leading to a potential data breach.
    - **Reputation Damage:** If the vulnerability is exploited at scale, it could damage the reputation of both the developers using the library and the library itself.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided examples and documentation actively encourage the insecure practice of storing credentials in `samples.ini`. The `MemStorage` class in samples also does not provide any security for credentials.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Discourage Plaintext Storage:** The library's documentation and samples should explicitly discourage the storage of sensitive credentials in plaintext configuration files like `samples.ini`. A strong warning about the security risks should be prominently displayed in the README and sample code documentation.
    - **Secure Credential Management Guidance:** The documentation should provide clear guidance and best practices for secure credential management. This should include recommendations to avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files checked into version control.
    - **Examples of Secure Alternatives:** The library should provide examples demonstrating secure alternatives for handling credentials, such as:
        - **Environment Variables:**  Illustrate how to read device credentials from environment variables, which are less likely to be inadvertently exposed in version control.
        - **Secure Vaults/Key Management Services:**  Recommend and ideally provide examples of integration with secure vaults or key management services (like Azure Key Vault) for production scenarios.
        - **Encrypted Configuration Files:** If configuration files are necessary, guide users on how to encrypt them and securely manage the decryption keys.
    - **Remove or Refactor `samples.ini`:** The library could consider removing the `samples.ini` example altogether or refactoring it to use less sensitive dummy data or instructions for secure credential input during sample execution.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. A developer uses the `iotc-python-client` library for prototyping or small projects.
    2. The developer follows the library's examples and creates a `samples.ini` file to store device connection credentials, including sensitive information like device keys or certificate paths.
    3. The developer inadvertently exposes the `samples.ini` file to unauthorized access. This could happen through:
        - Committing `samples.ini` to a public version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
        - Hosting the `samples.ini` file on a publicly accessible web server.
        - Insecurely sharing the `samples.ini` file through email or file sharing platforms.
        - Leaving the `samples.ini` file accessible on a system that is compromised or publicly accessible.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`README.md` and `/samples` directory description:** The `README.md` file, under the "Samples" section, explicitly instructs users to create a `samples.ini` file within the `samples` folder to configure device credentials. It provides an example `samples.ini` structure showing how to store `ScopeId`, `DeviceId`, `DeviceKey`, `GroupKey`, `CertFilePath`, `KeyFilePath`, and `CertPassphrase` in plaintext.
    2. **Sample Scripts (`/samples/async_device_key.py`, `/samples/async_x509.py`, etc.):** These scripts use `configparser` to read the `samples.ini` file. For example, in `samples/async_device_key.py`:
        ```python
        config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        config.read(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "samples.ini"))
        device_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceId"]
        scope_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["ScopeId"]
        key = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceKey"]
        ```
        The scripts then directly use these variables (`device_id`, `scope_id`, `key`, `x509` which contains certificate paths and passphrase) to initialize the `IoTCClient` and connect to Azure IoT Central.
    3. **`MemStorage` Class (`/samples` and `/src/iotc/test/utils.py`):** The `MemStorage` class, used in samples and tests, is a simple in-memory storage for credentials. It is not designed for secure storage and primarily serves as a placeholder or for testing purposes. It does not encrypt or protect the credentials in any way. The example `FileStorage` class mentioned in the `README.md` is not provided, but the existence of `MemStorage` and the instructions for `samples.ini` indicate a lack of focus on secure credential handling in the provided examples.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Create an Azure IoT Central application.
        b. Register a new device in the IoT Central application using symmetric key authentication. Obtain the Device ID, Scope ID, and Device Key for this device.
        c. Create a file named `samples.ini` in a local directory. Populate it with the following content, replacing placeholders with the actual credentials obtained in step 1b:
        ```ini
        [DEVICE_A]
        ScopeId = <YOUR_SCOPE_ID>
        DeviceId = <YOUR_DEVICE_ID>
        DeviceKey = <YOUR_DEVICE_KEY>
        ```
        d. Create a simple Python script (e.g., `exploit.py`) that reads credentials from this `samples.ini` file and uses the `iotc-python-client` library to connect to Azure IoT Central and send telemetry. The script should look similar to the provided sample scripts, but simplified to just send telemetry once after connection.
        ```python
        import os
        import configparser
        import asyncio
        from iotc.aio import IoTCClient
        from iotc import IOTCConnectType, IOTCLogLevel, IOTCEvents

        config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        config.read("samples.ini") # Assuming samples.ini is in the same directory

        device_id = config['DEVICE_A']['DeviceId']
        scope_id = config['DEVICE_A']['ScopeId']
        key = config['DEVICE_A']['DeviceKey']

        client = IoTCClient(
            device_id,
            scope_id,
            IOTCConnectType.IOTC_CONNECT_DEVICE_KEY,
            key,
        )

        async def main():
            await client.connect()
            if client.is_connected():
                await client.send_telemetry({"testTelemetry": "compromised"})
                print("Telemetry sent using stolen credentials.")
            await client.disconnect()

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            asyncio.run(main())
        ```
        e.  Make the `samples.ini` file publicly accessible. For example, you could:
            - Commit and push `samples.ini` to a public GitHub repository.
            - Host `samples.ini` on a publicly accessible web server.
            - Place `samples.ini` in a publicly shared cloud storage folder.

    2. **Attack Execution:**
        a. As an attacker, locate the publicly accessible `samples.ini` file (e.g., browse the public GitHub repository, access the web server URL, etc.).
        b. Download or copy the `samples.ini` file.
        c. Run the `exploit.py` script from your local machine, ensuring that the downloaded `samples.ini` file is in the same directory as `exploit.py`.
        ```bash
        python exploit.py
        ```

    3. **Verification:**
        a. Check the Azure IoT Central application. Navigate to the device you registered in step 1b.
        b. Verify that telemetry data with the value `{"testTelemetry": "compromised"}` has been received from the device.
        c. Successful reception of telemetry data confirms that the attacker has successfully used the stolen credentials from the publicly exposed `samples.ini` file to impersonate the device and connect to Azure IoT Central.
