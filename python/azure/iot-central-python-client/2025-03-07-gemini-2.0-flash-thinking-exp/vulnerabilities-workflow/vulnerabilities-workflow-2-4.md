### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Lack of Input Validation in Command and Property Handling leading to potential Callback Misuse
- Description:
    - Step 1: The SDK receives command and property updates from Azure IoT Central.
    - Step 2: The SDK extracts command names, command payloads, property names, and property values from the incoming messages.
    - Step 3: The SDK directly passes these extracted values to user-defined callback functions (registered using `iotc.on(IOTCEvents.IOTC_COMMAND, callback)` and `iotc.on(IOTCEvents.IOTC_PROPERTIES, callback)`).
    - Step 4: The SDK does not perform any validation or sanitization on these command and property data before invoking the callback functions.
    - Step 5: If a malicious actor can send crafted or unexpected commands or property updates from IoT Central, and if the user's callback functions are not designed to handle such input robustly (i.e., they lack input validation), it can lead to unintended behavior or errors in the device application logic implemented within the callback functions.
- Impact:
    - The impact depends on the implementation of the user-provided callback functions. A malicious actor could potentially cause:
        - Application errors or crashes on the device.
        - Unexpected or unintended device behavior.
        - In scenarios where callback functions interact with external systems or control device functionalities based on the received data, the lack of validation could potentially be leveraged for more significant impacts, although this is application-specific and beyond the scope of the SDK vulnerability itself.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The SDK does not implement any input validation or sanitization for command or property handling.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization should be implemented within the SDK to validate command names, property names, command payloads, and property values before passing them to user-defined callbacks.
    - Recommended mitigations include:
        - Implementing whitelists for allowed command and property names.
        - Validating the data types and formats of command payloads and property values against expected schemas.
        - Sanitizing input to prevent potential injection-style attacks, although the risk of direct injection vulnerabilities within the SDK itself is low, validation enhances overall robustness.
    - Documentation should be updated to explicitly warn developers about the lack of SDK-level input validation and strongly recommend implementing robust input validation within their command and property callback functions to handle potentially malicious or unexpected input from IoT Central.
- Preconditions:
    - The device must be connected to Azure IoT Central using the SDK.
    - An attacker must have the ability to send commands or property updates to the device from the connected Azure IoT Central application. This could be due to compromised IoT Central application credentials or vulnerabilities within the IoT Central service itself.
    - The user-implemented callback functions for command or property handling must lack sufficient input validation to handle unexpected or malicious data, making them susceptible to misuse.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/src/iotc/__init__.py` (sync client) and `/code/src/iotc/aio/__init__.py` (async client)**
        - **`_on_commands(self, method_request)` and `_on_enqueued_commands(self, c2d)` methods:**
            ```python
            def _on_commands(self, method_request): # Sync and Async versions are similar
                # ...
                command = Command(method_request.name, method_request.payload) # Command name and payload extracted directly
                # ...
                cmd_cb(command) # Callback invoked with command object
            ```
            ```python
            def _on_enqueued_commands(self, c2d): # Sync and Async versions are similar
                # ...
                c2d_name = c2d.custom_properties["method-name"] # Command name extracted directly
                command = Command(c2d_name, c2d.data) # Command name and data extracted directly
                # ...
                c2d_cb(command) # Callback invoked with command object
            ```
            - In both `_on_commands` and `_on_enqueued_commands`, the command name (`method_request.name` or `c2d_name`) and command value/payload (`method_request.payload` or `c2d.data`) are directly extracted from the incoming message and used to create a `Command` object, which is then passed to the user-defined callback function (`cmd_cb` or `c2d_cb`).
            - **There is no input validation or sanitization performed on `method_request.name`, `method_request.payload`, `c2d_name`, or `c2d.data` before they are used or passed to the callback.**

        - **`_on_properties(self, patch)` method:**
            ```python
            def _on_properties(self, patch): # Sync and Async versions are similar
                # ...
                for prop in patch: # Iterating through properties in the patch
                    # ...
                    self._handle_property_ack(prop_cb, prop, patch[prop], patch["$version"], ...) # Property name (prop) and value (patch[prop]) passed to _handle_property_ack
            ```
            ```python
            def _handle_property_ack( ... property_name, property_value, ...): # Sync and Async versions are similar
                # ...
                prop = Property(property_name, property_value, component_name) # Property name and value used to create Property object
                ret = callback(prop) # Callback invoked with property object
            ```
            - In `_on_properties`, the code iterates through the properties in the received `patch` dictionary. For each property, the property name (`prop`) and property value (`patch[prop]`) are directly extracted and used to create a `Property` object, which is then passed to the user-defined callback function (`prop_cb`).
            - **Similar to command handling, no input validation or sanitization is performed on property names or values extracted from the `patch` before they are used or passed to the callback.**

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Deploy the `samples/async_device_key.py` sample (or a similar synchronous sample) to a test device and ensure it connects to an Azure IoT Central application.
    - Step 2: Modify the `on_commands` callback function in the sample code to simply print the received command name and value, and acknowledge the command:
        ```python
        async def on_commands(command: Command): # For async sample; for sync remove async/await
            print(f"Received command - Name: '{command.name}', Value: '{command.value}'")
            await command.reply() # For async sample; for sync remove await
        ```
    - Step 3: In the Azure IoT Central application UI, navigate to the device connected in Step 1.
    - Step 4: Send a command to the device through IoT Central. Configure the command with:
        - Command Name: `maliciousCommandName`
        - Payload: `maliciousCommandPayload`
    - Step 5: Observe the console output of the device running the sample application. Verify that the output logs the received command name and value exactly as sent from IoT Central, indicating that the SDK did not perform any validation or rejection of the command. The output should be similar to:
        ```
        Received command - Name: 'maliciousCommandName', Value: 'maliciousCommandPayload'
        ```
    - Step 6: Repeat steps 2-5 for property updates. Modify the `on_props` callback to print the property name and value:
        ```python
        async def on_props(prop: Property): # For async sample; for sync remove async/await
            print(f"Received property - Name: '{prop.name}', Value: '{prop.value}'")
            return True
        ```
    - Step 7: In the Azure IoT Central application UI, update a writable property for the device. Set a property name and value that are unexpected or potentially malicious, e.g., Property Name: `maliciousPropertyName`, Property Value: `maliciousPropertyValue`.
    - Step 8: Observe the console output of the device. Verify that the output logs the received property name and value exactly as set in IoT Central, again demonstrating the lack of SDK-level validation. The output should be similar to:
        ```
        Received property - Name: 'maliciousPropertyName', Value: 'maliciousPropertyValue'
        ```
    - Step 9: Conclusion: The test case confirms that the SDK passes through arbitrary command and property data from IoT Central to the user-defined callback functions without performing any input validation. This lack of validation creates a potential vulnerability if developers do not implement sufficient validation in their callback functions, leading to potential misuse and unexpected device behavior when receiving malicious or unexpected input from IoT Central.
