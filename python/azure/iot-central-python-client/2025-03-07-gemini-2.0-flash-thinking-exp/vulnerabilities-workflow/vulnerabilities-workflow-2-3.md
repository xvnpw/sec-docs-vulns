- Vulnerability Name: Plaintext Storage of Device Credentials in Configuration File

- Description:
  1. The `iotc-python-device-client` library uses a configuration file named `samples.ini` to store device connection parameters.
  2. By default, the `samples.ini` file is located in the `samples` folder.
  3. The `samples.ini` file is intended to be used for running sample code provided with the library.
  4. The configuration file stores sensitive device credentials, such as `DeviceKey` and `GroupKey`, in plaintext.
  5. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the `samples.ini` file can read these plaintext credentials.
  6. With these stolen credentials, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate device.
  7. The attacker can then connect to the Azure IoT Central application associated with the device.
  8. Once connected, the attacker can send malicious telemetry data, issue commands to other devices (if the compromised device has such permissions), and potentially disrupt the IoT Central application's functionality.

- Impact:
  - **Device Impersonation:** Attackers can fully impersonate legitimate IoT devices, sending fabricated or malicious data to Azure IoT Central, leading to data integrity issues and potentially flawed analytics or control decisions based on this data.
  - **Unauthorized Data Injection:**  Malicious actors can inject false telemetry data, potentially skewing application insights, triggering incorrect alerts, or causing unintended actions within the IoT Central application based on this manipulated data.
  - **Potential Lateral Movement:** In scenarios where the compromised device has command-issuing capabilities, attackers might leverage this access to send unauthorized commands to other devices within the IoT Central ecosystem, expanding their attack surface.
  - **Reputation Damage:** If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to a breach impacting user trust and the reputation of the system employing this library.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **Disclaimer in README:** The README.md file includes a disclaimer stating: "**This library is experimental and has the purpose of providing an easy to use solution for prototyping and small projects. Its use in production is discouraged.**". This warns against using the library in production environments where security is critical, implicitly suggesting that the default configuration is not secure for production.
  - **No default `samples.ini` in repository**: The repository itself does not contain a `samples.ini` file with default credentials. Users must manually create this file, which means credentials are not exposed directly in the source code repository.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secure Credential Storage:** The library lacks secure storage mechanisms for device credentials. It should not rely on plaintext configuration files for sensitive information. Options include:
    - **Environment Variables:** Encourage users to use environment variables to store credentials instead of `samples.ini`.
    - **Credential Vaults/Managers:** Integrate with secure credential management systems or recommend their use.
    - **Encrypted Configuration Files:** Implement a mechanism to encrypt the `samples.ini` file or suggest using encrypted configuration file formats.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly related to plaintext storage, the library should incorporate input validation and sanitization for telemetry data and commands to prevent injection attacks if an attacker manages to impersonate a device.
  - **Security Best Practices Documentation:**  Provide clear documentation on security best practices, explicitly warning against plaintext storage of credentials and guiding users on secure configuration methods.

- Preconditions:
  - **Usage of `samples.ini` with default configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered when users rely on the default `samples.ini` file for storing device credentials, especially if they do not change the default settings or secure the file appropriately.
  - **Access to the file system where `samples.ini` is stored:** An attacker needs to gain access to the file system (e.g., through a compromised machine running the sample code, or a publicly accessible server where the file is inadvertently exposed).

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **`samples/async_device_key.py` (and other sample files):**
     ```python
     config = configparser.ConfigParser()
     config.read(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'samples.ini'))
     key = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceKey"]
     ```
     This code snippet from `samples/async_device_key.py` demonstrates how the sample code reads the `samples.ini` file using `configparser` and retrieves the `DeviceKey` in plaintext from the `DEVICE_M3` section. Similar patterns are used for other credentials like `ScopeId` and `DeviceId`.

  2. **`README.md` (Example `samples.ini`):**
     ```ini
     [DEVICE_A]
     ScopeId = scopeid
     DeviceId = deviceid
     ; either one or the other or nothing if running with certificates
     DeviceKey = device_key
     GroupKey = group_key
     ; none if running with keys
     CertFilePath = path_to_cert_file
     KeyFilePath = path_to_key_file
     CertPassphrase = optional password
     ```
     The README provides an example of the `samples.ini` file, clearly showing `DeviceKey` and `GroupKey` being stored in plaintext within the configuration file.

  3. **`src/iotc/__init__.py` and `src/iotc/aio/__init__.py`:**
     - The `IoTCClient` class in both synchronous and asynchronous versions accepts the `key_or_cert` parameter during initialization. This parameter, read directly from the `samples.ini` in sample codes, is then used to establish a connection to Azure IoT Central.
     - There is no code within the `IoTCClient` class or related modules that implements secure handling or storage of these credentials. The library directly utilizes the provided key for authentication without any encryption or secure storage practices.

  **Visualization:**

  ```
  samples/async_device_key.py --> configparser --> samples.ini (plaintext DeviceKey) --> IoTCClient (uses plaintext DeviceKey for connection) --> Azure IoT Central
  ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - You need an Azure subscription and an IoT Central application set up.
     - Create a device within your IoT Central application and obtain its Device ID, Scope ID, and Device Key.
     - Install the `iotc` Python library in a test environment.

  2. **Step 1: Create `samples.ini` with plaintext credentials:**
     - Navigate to the `samples` directory of the `iotc-python-client` project.
     - Create a file named `samples.ini` with the following content, replacing placeholders with your actual IoT Central credentials:
       ```ini
       [DEFAULT]
       Local = no

       [DEVICE_M3]
       ScopeId = <YOUR_SCOPE_ID>
       DeviceId = <YOUR_DEVICE_ID>
       DeviceKey = <YOUR_DEVICE_KEY>
       HubName = <YOUR_HUB_NAME>  ; Optional, can be left blank for DPS to resolve
       ModelId = <YOUR_MODEL_ID> ; Optional, if you have a device template
       ```
     - **Important:** Ensure `DeviceKey` is your actual device key in plaintext.

  3. **Step 2: Simulate Attacker Access:**
     - Assume an attacker gains access to the machine where `samples.ini` is stored and copies the `samples.ini` file. The attacker now has the plaintext credentials.

  4. **Step 3: Attacker Impersonates Device and Sends Malicious Telemetry:**
     - In a separate attacker's environment (or same environment, different directory), create a Python script (e.g., `attacker_script.py`) that uses the `iotc` library and the stolen credentials from `samples.ini`.
     - `attacker_script.py` (example):
       ```python
       import os
       import asyncio
       import configparser
       import sys
       from random import randint
       from iotc.models import Property, Command
       from iotc.aio import IoTCClient
       from iotc import IOTCConnectType, IOTCLogLevel, IOTCEvents

       config = configparser.ConfigParser()
       config.read('samples.ini') # Assuming attacker has copied samples.ini

       device_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceId"]
       scope_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["ScopeId"]
       key = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceKey"]

       class MemStorage: # Dummy storage
           def retrieve(self): return None
           def persist(self, credentials): return None

       client = IoTCClient(
           device_id,
           scope_id,
           IOTCConnectType.IOTC_CONNECT_DEVICE_KEY,
           key,
           storage=MemStorage(),
       )

       async def main():
           await client.connect()
           print(f"Attacker device connected as: {device_id}")
           for _ in range(5): # Send malicious telemetry 5 times
               malicious_data = {"maliciousTelemetry": "ATTACK!"}
               await client.send_telemetry(malicious_data)
               print(f"Sent malicious telemetry: {malicious_data}")
               await asyncio.sleep(2)
           await client.disconnect()

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           asyncio.run(main())
       ```
     - Place the copied `samples.ini` in the same directory as `attacker_script.py`.
     - Run `attacker_script.py`: `python attacker_script.py`

  5. **Step 4: Verify Impersonation in Azure IoT Central:**
     - Go to your Azure IoT Central application and navigate to the "Devices" section.
     - Find the Device ID you used in `samples.ini`.
     - Check the telemetry data received by the device. You should see the "maliciousTelemetry": "ATTACK!" messages sent by the `attacker_script.py`, confirming that the attacker successfully impersonated the device and sent data using the stolen plaintext credentials.

  This test case successfully demonstrates that plaintext storage of credentials in `samples.ini` allows an attacker to impersonate a device and send malicious telemetry.
