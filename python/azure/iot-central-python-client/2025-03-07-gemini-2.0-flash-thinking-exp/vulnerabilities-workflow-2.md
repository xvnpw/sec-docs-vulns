### Vulnerability: Insecure Storage of Device Credentials

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Device Credentials

- **Description:**
    1. The `iotc-python-client` library, in its sample code and documentation, instructs users to store sensitive device credentials such as `DeviceKey`, `GroupKey`, X.509 certificate paths, and certificate passphrases in a plain text configuration file named `samples.ini`. This file is intended to be placed within the `samples` directory of the project.
    2. Several example scripts, like `async_device_key.py`, `async_x509.py`, `sync_device_key.py`, and `sync_x509.py`, located in the `samples` directory, are configured to directly read these device credentials from the `samples.ini` file using the `configparser` library.
    3. If a developer using this library follows the provided samples and inadvertently exposes the `samples.ini` file to unauthorized access, attackers can easily retrieve the plaintext device credentials. Exposure can occur through various means, including committing the file to a public version control repository (like GitHub), hosting it on a public web server, insecure file sharing, or unauthorized access to the file system where the `samples.ini` file is stored.
    4. An attacker who gains access to the `samples.ini` file can read and extract sensitive device credentials, including `DeviceKey`, `GroupKey`, certificate file paths, and certificate passphrases, all stored in plain text within the configuration file.
    5. With these compromised credentials, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate device associated with the credentials.
    6. Using the `iotc` library or any compatible tool, the attacker can utilize the stolen credentials to connect to the Azure IoT Central application, effectively impersonating the device.
    7. Once connected as the impersonated device, the attacker can perform various malicious actions, such as sending fabricated telemetry data, manipulating device properties, and potentially intercepting or interfering with commands intended for the actual device, thus disrupting the IoT Central application's functionality and data integrity.

- **Impact:**
    - **Device Impersonation:** Attackers can fully impersonate legitimate IoT devices within Azure IoT Central. This allows them to act as the compromised device, sending data and potentially receiving commands as if they were the legitimate device.
    - **Data Breach:** Sensitive device credentials, including device keys and certificate information, are exposed in plaintext. This exposure can lead to further compromise and misuse of the device identity.
    - **Telemetry Manipulation:** Attackers can send false or malicious telemetry data to Azure IoT Central. This can lead to incorrect dashboards, alerts, and analytics within the IoT Central application, potentially causing flawed decision-making based on manipulated data.
    - **Unauthorized Device Control:** Depending on the IoT Central application's configuration and device capabilities, attackers might be able to manipulate device properties or send commands to the impersonated device. This could disrupt device operation, cause unintended actions, or potentially be used as a vector for further attacks on the IoT ecosystem.
    - **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The confidentiality of device credentials and the integrity of telemetry data are compromised due to the insecure storage of sensitive information.
    - **Reputation Damage:** If this vulnerability is widely exploited, it could damage the reputation of both the developers and users of the library, as well as the library itself.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Disclaimer in `README.md`:** The `README.md` file contains disclaimers stating that the library is experimental and intended for prototyping and small projects, discouraging its use in production environments. This serves as a weak, indirect mitigation by warning against production use where security is critical. However, it does not prevent users from insecurely storing credentials if they choose to use the library and follow the sample configurations.
    - **No default `samples.ini` in repository:** The GitHub repository does not include a `samples.ini` file by default. Users must manually create this file, meaning credentials are not directly exposed in the source code repository itself.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Credential Storage Guidance:** The project lacks clear and prominent warnings against storing credentials in plain text files. It should strongly advise users to avoid storing sensitive credentials in plaintext and use secure storage mechanisms.
    - **Discourage Plaintext Storage:** The library's documentation and samples should explicitly discourage the storage of sensitive credentials in plaintext configuration files like `samples.ini`. A strong warning about the security risks should be prominently displayed in the README and sample code documentation.
    - **Secure Configuration Examples:** The samples should be modified to demonstrate loading credentials from more secure sources. Examples should be provided for:
        - **Environment Variables:** Illustrate how to read device credentials from environment variables.
        - **Secure Vaults/Key Management Services:** Recommend and ideally provide examples of integration with secure vaults or key management services (like Azure Key Vault) for production scenarios.
        - **Encrypted Configuration Files:** If configuration files are necessary, guide users on how to encrypt them and securely manage the decryption keys.
    - **Removal or Refactor of Insecure Default:** The `samples.ini` example should be removed or replaced with a more secure default configuration approach to prevent users from inadvertently adopting insecure practices. Consider using less sensitive dummy data in samples or providing instructions for secure credential input during sample execution.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A user utilizes the `iotc-python-client` library, often for prototyping, development, or small projects.
    - The user follows the library's examples and documentation, creating a `samples.ini` file to store device connection credentials, including sensitive information like device keys or certificate paths.
    - The `samples.ini` file is placed in a location where unauthorized access is possible. This could be due to:
        - Committing `samples.ini` to a public version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
        - Hosting the `samples.ini` file on a publicly accessible web server.
        - Insecurely sharing the `samples.ini` file through email or file sharing platforms.
        - Leaving the `samples.ini` file accessible on a system that is compromised or publicly accessible.
        - An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the file system where `samples.ini` is stored through other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`README.md` and `/samples` Directory:** The `README.md` file, specifically in the "Samples" section, explicitly instructs users to create a `samples.ini` file within the `samples` folder for configuring device credentials. It provides an example `samples.ini` structure, clearly demonstrating how to store `ScopeId`, `DeviceId`, `DeviceKey`, `GroupKey`, `CertFilePath`, `KeyFilePath`, and `CertPassphrase` in plaintext.
    - **Sample Scripts (`/samples/async_device_key.py`, `/samples/async_x509.py`, `/samples/sync_device_key.py`, `/samples/sync_x509.py`):** These sample scripts utilize the `configparser` library to read configuration data directly from the `samples.ini` file. For example, in `samples/async_device_key.py`:
        ```python
        config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        config.read(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "samples.ini"))
        device_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceId"]
        scope_id = config["DEVICE_M3"]["ScopeId"]
        key = config["DEVICE_M3"]["DeviceKey"]
        ```
        The scripts directly access the `samples.ini` file, parse its content, and retrieve credentials like `DeviceKey`, `ScopeId`, and `DeviceId` in plaintext. These credentials are then used to initialize the `IoTCClient` and establish a connection to Azure IoT Central. Similar patterns are observed in other sample scripts for different authentication methods (X.509 certificates).
    - **`MemStorage` Class (`/samples` and `/src/iotc/test/utils.py`):** The `MemStorage` class, used in samples and tests, is a simple in-memory storage for credentials. It is not designed for secure storage and serves primarily for testing purposes. It does not offer any encryption or protection for the stored credentials.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Create an Azure IoT Central application and register a new device using symmetric key authentication. Obtain the `Device ID`, `Scope ID`, and `Device Key`.
        b. Clone the GitHub repository containing the `iotc-python-client` library to your local machine.
        c. Navigate to the `samples` directory within the cloned repository.
        d. Create a file named `samples.ini` in the `samples` directory and populate it with the following content, replacing placeholders with your actual IoT Central credentials:
        ```ini
        [DEVICE_A]
        ScopeId = <YOUR_SCOPE_ID>
        DeviceId = <YOUR_DEVICE_ID>
        DeviceKey = <YOUR_DEVICE_KEY>
        ```
        e. Install the `iotc` library and its dependencies: `pip install iotc`.
        f. Choose one of the sample scripts (e.g., `samples/async_device_key.py`).
        g. Run the sample script to verify that the device connects to Azure IoT Central and sends telemetry data, confirming the `samples.ini` configuration is working.
    2. **Attacker Access Simulation:**
        a. As an attacker, simulate gaining unauthorized access to the file system where `samples.ini` is located. For local testing, this can be direct file system access. In a real-world scenario, this could represent gaining access to a server or device through other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    3. **Credential Extraction:**
        a. Open the `samples.ini` file using a text editor or command-line tool.
        b. Observe that the device credentials (`DeviceKey`, `DeviceId`, `ScopeId`) are stored in plain text and easily readable.
        c. Copy the `DeviceKey` and `DeviceId`.
    4. **Device Impersonation Attack:**
        a. On a separate, attacker-controlled machine, create a new Python script (e.g., `attacker.py`).
        b. Install the `iotc` library on the attacker machine: `pip install iotc`.
        c. In `attacker.py`, import the `iotc` library and use `IoTCClient` to create a new client instance.
        d. Configure `IoTCClient` with the stolen `DeviceKey`, `DeviceId`, and `ScopeId` extracted from `samples.ini`. Use `IOTCConnectType.IOTC_CONNECT_DEVICE_KEY` for the connection type.
        e. Add code in `attacker.py` to connect to Azure IoT Central using `client.connect()`.
        f. Add code to send telemetry data using `client.send_telemetry({'attack': 'successful'})`.
        g. Run the `attacker.py` script: `python attacker.py`.
    5. **Verification of Successful Impersonation:**
        a. Access the Azure IoT Central application associated with the `ScopeId` used in `samples.ini`.
        b. Navigate to the device management section and locate the `DeviceId` that was impersonated.
        c. Monitor the telemetry data for this device in Azure IoT Central.
        d. Verify that telemetry data with the payload `'attack': 'successful'`, sent from the attacker's script, is visible in Azure IoT Central for the impersonated device. This confirms successful device impersonation using the stolen credentials from the plaintext `samples.ini` file.
