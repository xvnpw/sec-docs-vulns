### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Default or Weak Credentials on IBM Spectrum Symphony Web Interface
- Description:
  1. The IBM Spectrum Symphony installation process, as configured by the provided scripts, may lead to a state where default or weak credentials are used for the Symphony web interface.
  2. Specifically, while the provided `010_install_symphony_master.sh` script *comments out* setting a default password using `egoconfig setpassword -x Admin` for Symphony version 7.3.2, there is a risk that users may manually uncomment this line or use a similar approach to set a default password during installation, either intentionally for ease of initial setup, or unintentionally due to lack of security awareness.
  3. If default credentials are set and not subsequently changed to strong, unique passwords, an attacker could attempt to log in to the Symphony web interface using these well-known default credentials (like 'Admin'/'Admin' or similar common defaults).
  4. Successful login with default credentials grants the attacker unauthorized access to the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface.
- Impact:
  - Unauthorized access to the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface.
  - An attacker could manage workloads, access sensitive data related to workloads and cluster configuration, and potentially compromise the entire IBM Spectrum Symphony cluster and the underlying infrastructure.
  - This could lead to data breaches, disruption of services, and further malicious activities within the Azure environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The provided `010_install_symphony_master.sh` script *comments out* the command that would set a default password (`egoconfig setpassword -x Admin`). This is a partial mitigation as it avoids *automatically* setting a default password in the provided configuration.
  - The scripts use `jetpack config` to manage credentials (`symphony.soam.user`, `symphony.soam.password`), encouraging users to configure credentials through CycleCloud parameters, which is a more secure approach than hardcoding.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Enforced Strong Password Policy:** The project lacks any enforced policy or guidance to ensure users set strong, unique passwords during the IBM Spectrum Symphony installation.
  - **Default Password Change Enforcement:** There is no mechanism to force users to change any initially set password (even if manually set using `egoconfig setpassword`) upon first login or during the initial setup process.
  - **Security Hardening Guide:** The project lacks a comprehensive security hardening guide that explicitly warns against using default credentials and provides best practices for securing the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface, including password management, access control, and network security (e.g., not exposing the web interface publicly without proper authentication and authorization).
  - **Automated Security Checks:** The project does not include automated security checks or scripts that would detect the presence of default or weak credentials on the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface.
- Preconditions:
  - IBM Spectrum Symphony is deployed using the provided scripts and configurations.
  - During the installation process, default or weak credentials are set for the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface, either intentionally or unintentionally by the user.
  - The IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface is accessible over the network, potentially exposed to the public internet without proper network-level access control or strong authentication enforcement.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/specs/master/cluster-init/scripts/010_install_symphony_master.sh`
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # ...
    # for 7.3.2
    #su - -c "source /etc/profile.d/symphony.sh && yes | egoconfig setpassword -x Admin && egoconfig setentitlement ${SYM_ENTITLEMENT_FILE}" egoadmin
    #7.3.1
    su - -c "source /etc/profile.d/symphony.sh && yes | egoconfig setentitlement ${SYM_ENTITLEMENT_FILE}" egoadmin
    # ...
    ```
    - The script contains a commented-out section intended for Symphony version 7.3.2 that includes the command `egoconfig setpassword -x Admin`.
    - While this line is commented out in the provided script, it highlights a potential vulnerability if a user were to uncomment it or manually execute a similar command.
    - If this line (or equivalent commands setting default passwords) is active during the master node installation, it would set the 'Admin' user password to the weak default 'Admin'.
    - An attacker, knowing this common default, could attempt to exploit it if the web interface is accessible.
  - Other scripts and configuration files in the project do not explicitly set default passwords, but they do not prevent a user from doing so manually or through misconfiguration during the deployment process.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Deploy IBM Spectrum Symphony cluster using the provided scripts, but **manually uncomment and enable the default password setting** in `/code/specs/master/cluster-init/scripts/010_install_symphony_master.sh` (uncomment the line `#su - -c "source ... egoconfig setpassword -x Admin ..."`).
  2. Wait for the cluster deployment to complete and ensure the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface is accessible (obtain the public IP or DNS name of the master node if exposed).
  3. Open a web browser and navigate to the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface URL.
  4. Attempt to log in using the username 'Admin' and the password 'Admin' (or any other common default password, if a different default was manually set).
  5. **Expected Result:** If the default password was successfully set and not changed, the login attempt should be successful, granting the attacker access to the IBM Spectrum Symphony web interface.
  6. **Verification:** After successful login, verify that you have access to administrative functionalities of the Symphony cluster through the web interface, such as managing workloads, users, and cluster settings.
  7. **Cleanup:** Terminate the deployed cluster to prevent ongoing vulnerability.
