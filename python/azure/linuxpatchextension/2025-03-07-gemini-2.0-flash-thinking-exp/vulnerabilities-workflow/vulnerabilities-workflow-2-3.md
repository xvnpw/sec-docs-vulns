- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Patches Parameters

- Description:
  An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system by manipulating the `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` parameters in the extension configuration. This is possible because the extension insufficiently sanitizes these parameters before using them in shell commands during patch operations.
  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker gains control over the configuration of the Azure Linux VM Patch Extension. This could be achieved through various means depending on the Azure environment's security configuration (e.g., compromised Azure account, insider threat, etc.).
    2. The attacker modifies the extension configuration, specifically setting malicious values for either `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` parameters. For example, the attacker might set `patchesToInclude` to `["package1; command_to_execute"]`.
    3. The extension attempts to execute a patch operation (Assessment or Installation) using this configuration.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization, the malicious command injected in `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` is executed by the system shell during the patch operation.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the Azure Linux VM Patch Extension, which is typically root. This could lead to:
    - Full control over the compromised VM.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Lateral movement to other resources within the Azure environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  No input sanitization is implemented in the provided code to prevent command injection in `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` parameters.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for the `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` parameters. This should include validating the input against a whitelist of allowed characters and escaping or rejecting any potentially harmful characters or command separators.
    - Parameterization of commands: Instead of directly embedding user-provided input into shell commands, use parameterized commands or functions that prevent command injection. If shell commands must be constructed dynamically, ensure proper escaping of all user-provided inputs using shell quoting functions.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension runs with the minimum privileges necessary to perform its patching operations. While root privileges might be required for patching itself, avoid running the entire extension with root privileges if possible.

- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker must have the ability to modify the Azure Linux VM Patch Extension configuration, which typically requires administrative privileges within the Azure environment.
    2. The Azure Linux VM Patch Extension must be configured to use the attacker-modified configuration.
    3. A patch operation (Assessment or Installation) must be initiated after the configuration is modified.

- Source Code Analysis:
  The provided project files do not contain the Python code that directly processes the extension configuration and executes patching commands. To confirm this vulnerability and pinpoint the vulnerable code, access to the `MsftLinuxPatchExt.py` and core Python code (potentially within `MsftLinuxPatchCore.py`) is required. However, based on the description of the vulnerability and typical patterns in similar extensions, the following scenario is highly probable:

  1. The extension reads configuration parameters, including `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude`, from a settings file or handler environment.
  2. The extension constructs shell commands to perform patch operations (e.g., using `yum`, `apt`, or `zypper`).
  3. The values from `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` are directly embedded into these shell commands without proper sanitization.
  4. The shell commands are executed using a function like `subprocess.Popen` or `os.system`, which interprets and executes the injected commands.

  **Visualization:**

  ```
  [Extension Configuration] --> (Reads patchesToInclude/patchesToExclude) --> [Shell Command Construction (Vulnerable)] --> [subprocess.Popen/os.system] --> [Command Execution on VM]
  ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
    - Deploy an Azure Linux VM instance with the Azure Linux VM Patch Extension installed.
    - Obtain necessary credentials to manage the VM's extension configuration (assuming external attacker scenario, this step might involve exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access).
  2. **Configuration Modification:**
    - Modify the extension settings for the target VM.
    - Set the `patchesToInclude` parameter to: `["testpackage; touch /tmp/pwned;"]`. This attempts to inject a command that creates a file `/tmp/pwned` on the VM.
    - Update the extension configuration with these modified settings.
  3. **Trigger Patch Operation:**
    - Initiate a patch assessment or installation operation on the Azure Linux VM through the Azure portal or Azure CLI.
  4. **Verification:**
    - After the patch operation completes (or fails), connect to the Azure Linux VM (e.g., via SSH).
    - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If the file exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.
    - Examine extension logs (under `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension/`) for any error messages or unusual activity during the patch operation, which could indicate command injection attempt and success.
