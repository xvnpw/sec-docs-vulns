- vulnerability name: Command Injection in Patch List Parameters
- description:
  - An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` parameters of the extension settings.
  - When the extension executes patch operations, these parameters are not properly sanitized.
  - This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to insert malicious shell commands within these parameters.
  - The injected commands are then executed by the extension with root privileges during patch installation or assessment.
  - For example, an attacker could set `patchesToInclude` to `["packageA; malicious_command; packageB"]`. When the extension processes this, the `malicious_command` will be executed.
- impact:
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  - An attacker can gain complete control of the target Linux VM by executing arbitrary commands as root. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations:
  - No input sanitization is implemented for `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` parameters in the provided code.
- missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization for `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` parameters to prevent command injection.
  - Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in shell commands.
  - Consider using parameterized queries or functions that prevent command injection by design, rather than relying on sanitization.
- preconditions:
  - Attacker needs to be able to modify the extension settings. In Azure VM extensions, this typically requires administrative privileges or exploiting other Azure vulnerabilities to modify the extension configuration. However, the description assumes an external attacker. In the context of Azure VM extensions, this means an attacker who can somehow influence the parameters passed to the extension, which is generally an administrative action.
- source code analysis:
  - The provided project files do not include the Python code that directly processes `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude`. To confirm this vulnerability and provide a detailed source code analysis, access to the Python code handling these parameters (likely within `MsftLinuxPatchExt.py` or similar core Python files, which are not provided in PROJECT FILES) is necessary. However, based on the description and general understanding of how extensions and shell scripts interact, the vulnerability likely exists in how these parameters are passed from the extension handler script (`MsftLinuxPatchExtShim.sh`) to the core Python script (`MsftLinuxPatchExt.py`) and subsequently used to construct and execute shell commands within the core Python code.
  - **Hypothetical Source Code Analysis (based on vulnerability description):**
  ```python
  # Hypothetical code snippet within MsftLinuxPatchExt.py (or similar core Python file)
  import subprocess

  def install_patches(patches_to_include):
      patch_string = " ".join(patches_to_include)
      command = "yum install -y " + patch_string  # Vulnerable command construction
      subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True) # Command execution

  # ... (parameter retrieval from extension settings, e.g., HandlerEnvironment.json and <seq>.settings) ...
  extension_settings = load_extension_settings()
  patches_to_include = extension_settings.get("patchesToInclude", [])
  install_patches(patches_to_include) # Vulnerable function call
  ```
  - In this hypothetical example, the `install_patches` function directly concatenates the unsanitized `patches_to_include` list into a shell command, creating the command injection vulnerability.
- security test case:
  - Preconditions:
    - An Azure Linux VM with the LinuxPatchExtension installed.
    - Access to configure the extension settings (requires administrative privileges in Azure).
  - Steps:
    1. Access the Azure portal or use Azure CLI to manage the target Linux VM.
    2. Navigate to the settings of the LinuxPatchExtension.
    3. Locate the `patchesToInclude` parameter in the extension configuration.
    4. Set the value of `patchesToInclude` to: `["testpackage; touch /tmp/pwned;"]`. This injects the command `touch /tmp/pwned` after a valid package name.
    5. Trigger a patch installation operation on the VM through the Azure portal or API.
    6. After the patch operation completes (or fails), connect to the VM via SSH.
    7. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
  - Expected result:
    - If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created on the VM, indicating successful command injection and remote code execution.
    - If the vulnerability is mitigated, the file `/tmp/pwned` will not be created, and the patch operation should either fail safely or proceed without executing the injected command.
