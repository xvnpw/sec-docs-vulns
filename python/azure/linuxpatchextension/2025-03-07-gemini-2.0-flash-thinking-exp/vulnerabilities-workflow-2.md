- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in HandlerEnvironment.json Configuration Paths

- Description:
    1. An attacker with write access to the `HandlerEnvironment.json` file on the target VM can modify the `logFolder`, `configFolder`, or `statusFolder` paths.
    2. The `MsftLinuxPatchExtShim.sh` script and Python code within the extension use these paths as base directories for logging, configuration, and status files.
    3. By crafting a malicious `HandlerEnvironment.json` with paths like `/var/log/../../../../system/critical`, an attacker can potentially redirect extension operations to arbitrary file system locations.
    4. For example, redirecting the `logFolder` to `/var/log/../../../../system/critical` and triggering a patch operation could lead to the extension attempting to write logs to `/system/critical`, potentially overwriting critical system files.
    5. Similarly, manipulating `configFolder` or `statusFolder` could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities in configuration or status handling.

- Impact:
    * File Overwrite: An attacker could overwrite critical system files by redirecting log or configuration output to sensitive locations.
    * Unauthorized File Access: By redirecting configuration or status paths, an attacker might gain read or write access to files outside of the intended extension directories, potentially including sensitive data.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * No explicit path traversal sanitization or validation is implemented in the provided code for paths read from `HandlerEnvironment.json`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for `logFolder`, `configFolder`, and `statusFolder` paths in `HandlerEnvironment.json` to prevent path traversal.
    * Implement path canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and ensure paths stay within expected directories.
    * Consider using absolute paths defined within the extension code instead of relying on user-provided configuration for critical file operations.
    * Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension process runs with the minimal permissions necessary, reducing the impact of potential path traversal exploits.

- Preconditions:
    * Attacker has write access to the `HandlerEnvironment.json` file. This could be achieved through compromised VM credentials, another vulnerability, or insider threat.
    * The Azure Linux VM Patch Extension is installed and enabled on the target VM.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`File: /code/README.md`**: The README.md file describes how to configure the extension locally, explicitly mentioning `HandlerEnvironment.json` and its role in defining `logFolder`, `configFolder`, and `statusFolder`. It states: *"HandlerEnvironment.json defines the location where log, config and status files will be saved. Make sure to specify a directory/folder path for all 3 (can be any location within the machine)"*. This highlights the user-controlled nature of these paths.
    2. **`File: /code/src/extension/src/MsftLinuxPatchExtShim.sh`**: This script is the main entry point. It sources extension scripts but doesn't directly handle `HandlerEnvironment.json` or path processing. It calls `MsftLinuxPatchExt.py`, where the core logic resides.
    3. **Further code analysis is needed to pinpoint exactly where and how `HandlerEnvironment.json` paths are used in Python code and if any path traversal vulnerabilities exist.** Source code for Python modules is not provided in PROJECT FILES, further analysis is not possible with provided files only.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Precondition: Assume you have access to an Azure Linux VM where the Azure Linux VM Patch Extension is installed and enabled. You also have credentials to modify files on the VM (e.g., through SSH or Azure VM Run Command if allowed by VM configuration).
    2. Step 1: Locate the `HandlerEnvironment.json` file on the VM. Its location is typically within the extension directory, which can be found under `/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension-<version>/`.
    3. Step 2: Edit `HandlerEnvironment.json` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. Modify the `logFolder` value to a path outside the intended log directory, for example: `/var/log/../../../../tmp/attack_logs`. Save the changes.
    ```json
    {
      "version": 1.0,
      "handlerEnvironment": {
        "logFolder": "/var/log/../../../../tmp/attack_logs",
        "configFolder": "/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension-1.2.3/config",
        "statusFolder": "/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension-1.2.3/status"
      }
    }
    ```
    4. Step 3: Trigger a patch operation on the VM. This can be done through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell by initiating an "Assess Patches" or "Install Patches" operation on the VM.
    5. Step 4: After the patch operation completes (or fails), check the `/tmp/attack_logs` directory on the VM. If the path traversal vulnerability is present, you will find log files created by the extension within this directory, instead of the intended log directory under `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension/`.
    6. Step 5: (Optional, for further impact demonstration): Modify `configFolder` or `statusFolder` in `HandlerEnvironment.json` similarly and observe if you can influence the extension's behavior by manipulating configuration or status file paths. For example, try to redirect `statusFolder` to `/etc/cron.d/` and observe if you can create or overwrite cron jobs.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Patch List Parameters

- Description:
  - An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude` parameters of the extension settings.
  - When the extension executes patch operations, these parameters are not properly sanitized.
  - This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to insert malicious shell commands within these parameters.
  - The injected commands are then executed by the extension with root privileges during patch installation or assessment.
  - For example, an attacker could set `patchesToInclude` to `["packageA; malicious_command; packageB"]`. When the extension processes this, the `malicious_command` will be executed.

- Impact:
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  - An attacker can gain complete control of the target Linux VM by executing arbitrary commands as root. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - No input sanitization is implemented for `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` parameters in the provided code.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization for `patchesToInclude` and `patchesToExclude` parameters to prevent command injection.
  - Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in shell commands.
  - Consider using parameterized queries or functions that prevent command injection by design, rather than relying on sanitization.

- Preconditions:
  - Attacker needs to be able to modify the extension settings. In Azure VM extensions, this typically requires administrative privileges or exploiting other Azure vulnerabilities to modify the extension configuration. However, the description assumes an external attacker. In the context of Azure VM extensions, this means an attacker who can somehow influence the parameters passed to the extension, which is generally an administrative action.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not include the Python code that directly processes `patchesToInclude` or `patchesToExclude`. To confirm this vulnerability and provide a detailed source code analysis, access to the Python code handling these parameters (likely within `MsftLinuxPatchExt.py` or similar core Python files, which are not provided in PROJECT FILES) is necessary. However, based on the description and general understanding of how extensions and shell scripts interact, the vulnerability likely exists in how these parameters are passed from the extension handler script (`MsftLinuxPatchExtShim.sh`) to the core Python script (`MsftLinuxPatchExt.py`) and subsequently used to construct and execute shell commands within the core Python code.
  - **Hypothetical Source Code Analysis (based on vulnerability description):**
  ```python
  # Hypothetical code snippet within MsftLinuxPatchExt.py (or similar core Python file)
  import subprocess

  def install_patches(patches_to_include):
      patch_string = " ".join(patches_to_include)
      command = "yum install -y " + patch_string  # Vulnerable command construction
      subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True) # Command execution

  # ... (parameter retrieval from extension settings, e.g., HandlerEnvironment.json and <seq>.settings) ...
  extension_settings = load_extension_settings()
  patches_to_include = extension_settings.get("patchesToInclude", [])
  install_patches(patches_to_include) # Vulnerable function call
  ```
  - In this hypothetical example, the `install_patches` function directly concatenates the unsanitized `patches_to_include` list into a shell command, creating the command injection vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
  - Preconditions:
    - An Azure Linux VM with the LinuxPatchExtension installed.
    - Access to configure the extension settings (requires administrative privileges in Azure).
  - Steps:
    1. Access the Azure portal or use Azure CLI to manage the target Linux VM.
    2. Navigate to the settings of the LinuxPatchExtension.
    3. Locate the `patchesToInclude` parameter in the extension configuration.
    4. Set the value of `patchesToInclude` to: `["testpackage; touch /tmp/pwned;"]`. This injects the command `touch /tmp/pwned` after a valid package name.
    5. Trigger a patch installation operation on the VM through the Azure portal or API.
    6. After the patch operation completes (or fails), connect to the VM via SSH.
    7. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
  - Expected result:
    - If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created on the VM, indicating successful command injection and remote code execution.
    - If the vulnerability is mitigated, the file `/tmp/pwned` will not be created, and the patch operation should either fail safely or proceed without executing the injected command.
