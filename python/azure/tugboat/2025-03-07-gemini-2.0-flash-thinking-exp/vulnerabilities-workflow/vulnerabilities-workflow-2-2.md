*   Vulnerability name: Command Injection via `extra_docker_args`

*   Description:
    1.  An attacker can control the `extra_docker_args` parameter of the `ContainerSpec` or `ExecSpec` when using the Tugboat library.
    2.  The `_get_docker_args` function in `client_interface.py` takes these `extra_docker_args` and directly appends them to the Docker command list without any sanitization or validation.
    3.  When `tugboat.run` or `tugboat.run_sync` is called with a `ContainerSpec` or when `container.exec` is called with `ExecSpec`, these unsanitized `extra_docker_args` are passed directly to the underlying Docker command execution.
    4.  By crafting malicious arguments within `extra_docker_args`, an attacker can inject arbitrary Docker commands or options, leading to unintended actions within the Docker environment.
    5.  For example, an attacker could inject arguments to mount arbitrary host paths, expose ports, or modify container configurations in ways not intended by the application developer using Tugboat.

*   Impact:
    -   **High**. Successful command injection can allow an attacker to gain significant control over the Docker environment.
    -   An attacker could potentially escalate privileges, access sensitive data on the Docker host or within other containers, or disrupt services by manipulating containers.
    -   In the context of containerized applications using Tugboat, this vulnerability could lead to container breakouts or compromise of the underlying infrastructure if Tugboat is used in insecure ways.

*   Vulnerability rank: High

*   Currently implemented mitigations:
    -   None. The code directly incorporates `extra_docker_args` into the Docker commands without any sanitization.

*   Missing mitigations:
    -   Input validation and sanitization for `extra_docker_args`.
    -   Restrict the usage of `extra_docker_args` or provide clear warnings about its security implications in the documentation.
    -   Consider removing or redesigning the `extra_docker_args` feature if it's not essential and poses a significant security risk. If it's necessary, implement a safer way to handle extra arguments, possibly by defining a whitelist of allowed arguments or enforcing strict formatting.

*   Preconditions:
    -   An application must be using the Tugboat library and allow user-controlled input to be passed to the `extra_docker_args` parameter of `ContainerSpec` or `ExecSpec`.
    -   The attacker needs to be able to influence the creation of `ContainerSpec` or `ExecSpec` objects within the application using Tugboat.

*   Source code analysis:
    1.  File: `/code/src/tugboat/client_interface.py`
    2.  Function: `_get_docker_args(spec: CommandSpec) -> List[str]`
    3.  This function is responsible for constructing Docker command arguments from a `CommandSpec` object.
    4.  Line: `docker_args += spec.extra_docker_args`
    5.  This line directly appends the list `spec.extra_docker_args` to the `docker_args` list without any sanitization.
    6.  `spec.extra_docker_args` is directly derived from the `extra_docker_args` attribute of `CommandSpec` (and its subclasses like `ContainerSpec` and `ExecSpec`).
    7.  If an attacker can control the content of `extra_docker_args` when creating a `ContainerSpec` or `ExecSpec`, they can inject arbitrary Docker command options.

    ```python
    def _get_docker_args(spec: CommandSpec) -> List[str]:
        docker_args: List[str] = []
        if spec.user is not None:
            docker_args += ["--user", spec.user]
        if spec.working_directory is not None:
            docker_args += ["--workdir", str(spec.working_directory)]
        for name, value in spec.environment.items():
            if value is not None:
                docker_args += ["--env", f"{name}={value}"]
            else:
                docker_args += ["--env", name]
        # Vulnerability is here: extra_docker_args is directly appended
        docker_args += spec.extra_docker_args
        return docker_args
    ```

    8.  This `_get_docker_args` function is used in `create` and `exec_` functions in `client_interface.py`, thus affecting both container creation and command execution within containers.

*   Security test case:
    1.  Assume there's an application using Tugboat that allows users to specify extra Docker arguments through an input field (e.g., a web form or command-line argument).
    2.  The attacker crafts a malicious input for `extra_docker_args`, for example: `['--volume', '/host/path:/container/path']`. In a real attack, `/host/path` would be a sensitive directory on the host. For testing, we can use `/tmp:/container/path`.
    3.  The application uses this user input to create a `ContainerSpec` and run a container:
        ```python
        import tugboat

        user_provided_extra_args = ['--volume', '/tmp:/container_path'] # Attacker controlled input

        spec = tugboat.ContainerSpec("ubuntu:latest")
        spec.add_extra_docker_args(user_provided_extra_args)
        spec.set_args(['ls', '/container_path'])
        spec.set_stdout(tugboat.PIPE)

        result = tugboat.run_sync(spec)
        print(result.stdout)
        ```
    4.  Run this Python code.
    5.  Expected Result: The command `ls /container_path` will be executed within the Docker container, but due to the injected `--volume` argument, `/tmp` directory from the host will be mounted into the container at `/container_path`. The output of `ls /container_path` will list the files and directories in the host's `/tmp` directory, demonstrating successful command injection and host path mounting.
    6.  This test case demonstrates that by controlling `extra_docker_args`, an attacker can inject arbitrary Docker arguments and potentially mount host directories into the container, which is a security vulnerability.
