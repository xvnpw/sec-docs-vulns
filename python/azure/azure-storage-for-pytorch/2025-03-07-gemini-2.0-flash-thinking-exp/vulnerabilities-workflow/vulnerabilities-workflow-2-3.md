### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unintentional Credential Exposure via DefaultAzureCredential
- Description:
    1. A user integrates `azstoragetorch` into their PyTorch project.
    2. The user initializes `BlobIO` without explicitly providing credentials, relying on the default behavior.
    3. `BlobIO` by default uses `DefaultAzureCredential` for authentication.
    4. If the PyTorch project runs in an environment where `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves to credentials with broad Azure permissions (e.g., a development environment with a logged-in Azure CLI user, or a VM/container with a managed identity assigned broad roles), these credentials will be used to access Azure Storage.
    5. If the user then unintentionally exposes their project code, configuration, or environment (e.g., by committing code with hardcoded blob URLs to a public repository, or running the application in an insecure environment), the implicitly used `DefaultAzureCredential` could be exposed as well, granting unintended parties access to Azure Storage with the permissions associated with those credentials.
    6. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the Azure Storage account.
- Impact: Unintentional exposure of Azure Storage credentials can lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential financial impact.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The library uses `azure-identity` which is the recommended way to handle Azure credentials in Azure SDKs.
    - The library allows users to explicitly provide credentials (using `credential` parameter in `BlobIO` constructor) or use anonymous access (by setting `credential=False`), giving them control over credential management.
    - `SECURITY.md` provides general security reporting instructions for Microsoft repositories.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Explicit warning in the library's documentation about the security implications of using `DefaultAzureCredential`, especially in production environments and the risk of unintentional credential exposure.
    - Best practices guide or dedicated documentation section for securely managing Azure Storage credentials when using this library, emphasizing least privilege and secure credential storage.
    - Example code snippets in documentation that demonstrate secure credential handling, such as:
        - Emphasizing the use of explicit credential objects.
        - Recommending environment variables for storage account names instead of hardcoding.
        - Showing how to use more restrictive credential types when appropriate (e.g., SAS tokens for limited access).
- Preconditions:
    - User uses `BlobIO` without explicitly providing the `credential` parameter.
    - `DefaultAzureCredential` in the environment where the PyTorch project is executed resolves to credentials that have broad Azure permissions (e.g., Storage Blob Data Contributor or higher).
    - User unintentionally exposes their project code, configuration files, or the environment where the application is running.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/azstoragetorch/io.py`
    - Class: `BlobIO`
    - Method: `__init__`
    - Line: `self._client = self._get_azstoragetorch_blob_client(blob_url, credential, _internal_only_kwargs.get("azstoragetorch_blob_client_cls", _AzStorageTorchBlobClient))`
    - Method: `_get_sdk_credential`
    - Lines:
        ```python
        def _get_sdk_credential(
            self, blob_url: str, credential: _AZSTORAGETORCH_CREDENTIAL_TYPE
        ) -> _SDK_CREDENTIAL_TYPE:
            if credential is False or self._blob_url_has_sas_token(blob_url):
                return None
            if credential is None:
                return DefaultAzureCredential() # DefaultAzureCredential is used here
            if isinstance(credential, (AzureSasCredential, TokenCredential)):
                return credential
            raise TypeError(f"Unsupported credential: {type(credential)}")
        ```
    - The `_get_sdk_credential` method within the `BlobIO` class defaults to using `DefaultAzureCredential` if no explicit credential is provided and no SAS token is detected in the blob URL. This default behavior, while convenient in some scenarios, can lead to unintentional credential exposure if users are not fully aware of its implications and best practices for secure credential management in different deployment environments.
- Security test case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - An Azure subscription.
        - An Azure Storage Account.
        - Permissions to read/write blobs in the storage account for the user or service principal used by `DefaultAzureCredential`. For example, assign "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to your Azure account at the storage account level.
        - Install `azure-cli` and log in to Azure (`az login`) with a user that has the required permissions. This will configure `DefaultAzureCredential` to use your logged-in user's credentials.
        - Install `azstoragetorch` library.
    2. **Create a Python script (e.g., `test_credential_exposure.py`):**
        ```python
        from azstoragetorch.io import BlobIO
        import os

        storage_account_name = os.environ.get("AZSTORAGETORCH_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME") # User might hardcode this or manage insecurely
        container_name = "test-container-azstoragetorch" # Replace with your container name
        blob_name = "test-blob.txt" # Replace with your blob name

        blob_url = f"https://{storage_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/{container_name}/{blob_name}"

        try:
            with BlobIO(blob_url, mode="rb") as blob_file: # Using default credential
                content = blob_file.read()
                print(f"Successfully read blob content: {content}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading blob: {e}")
        ```
    3. **Set environment variable:**
        ```bash
        export AZSTORAGETORCH_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your_storage_account_name> # Replace with your storage account name
        ```
    4. **Run the script:**
        ```bash
        python test_credential_exposure.py
        ```
        - Observe that the script successfully reads the blob content. This confirms that `DefaultAzureCredential` is being used and is working with your current Azure environment's credentials.
    5. **Simulate Credential Exposure (Conceptual):**
        - Imagine you accidentally commit `test_credential_exposure.py` to a public GitHub repository.
        - An attacker finds this script. They can run this script in their own environment.
        - If the attacker's environment also has `DefaultAzureCredential` configured (e.g., they are also logged into Azure CLI, or their environment has a Managed Identity), and if those credentials happen to have access to *your* storage account (which is less likely in a real attack scenario against a correctly configured environment, but possible if permissions are overly broad or in misconfigured setups), the attacker *could* potentially gain unauthorized access to your Azure Storage account using the implicit `DefaultAzureCredential` mechanism that your script relies on.
    6. **Mitigation Demonstration (Optional):**
        - To mitigate this, the user should be explicitly informed to avoid relying on default credentials in production and to use more secure methods like explicit credentials or SAS tokens, and to manage storage account names and blob URLs securely, not hardcoding them in code committed to public repositories.

This security test case demonstrates how relying on `DefaultAzureCredential` without explicit user awareness and guidance can potentially lead to unintentional credential exposure, especially when code or configurations are not managed securely.
