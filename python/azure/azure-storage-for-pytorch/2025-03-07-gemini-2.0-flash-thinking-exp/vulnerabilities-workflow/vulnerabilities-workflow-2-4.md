### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Plaintext Logging of Azure Storage Connection Strings
- Description:
    - In a future version of this library, if connection strings or sensitive credential information used to access Azure Storage are logged in plain text, an attacker could potentially gain access to these credentials.
    - This could occur if logging mechanisms are introduced that inadvertently capture and store connection strings, for example, in application logs, debug outputs, or error messages.
    - An attacker could then exploit this vulnerability by gaining unauthorized access to these logs through various means, such as:
        - Accessing log files stored on the system where the library is running.
        - Intercepting log streams if logs are sent to a centralized logging system without proper security measures.
        - Gaining access to memory dumps or crash reports that might contain logged connection strings.
    - Once the attacker obtains the connection strings, they can use them to authenticate to the associated Azure Storage account and perform unauthorized actions, such as reading, modifying, or deleting data, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised connection string.
- Impact:
    - High. If an attacker gains access to Azure Storage connection strings, they can compromise the associated Azure Storage account. This could lead to:
        - Data Breach: Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data stored in the Azure Storage account.
        - Data Manipulation: Unauthorized modification or deletion of data, leading to data integrity issues or data loss.
        - Service Disruption:  Malicious activities that could disrupt the availability and functionality of applications relying on the compromised storage account.
        - Resource Hijacking: Using the storage account for malicious purposes, potentially incurring costs and damaging reputation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The current version of the library is in early development and does not implement any logging functionality that could expose connection strings.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure Logging Practices: Implement secure logging practices to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information:
        - Avoid logging connection strings or sensitive credentials directly.
        - If logging of connection details is necessary for debugging, ensure that only non-sensitive information is logged, or use secure masking/redaction techniques.
        - Implement secure storage and access controls for log files to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
        - Consider using dedicated secret management solutions to handle and log sensitive credentials securely.
- Preconditions:
    - A future version of the library must introduce logging functionality that inadvertently logs Azure Storage connection strings or other sensitive credential information in plaintext.
    - An attacker must gain access to the logs or memory where these plaintext connection strings are stored.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Currently, the provided source code does not contain any explicit logging of connection strings.
    - Review of `/code/src/azstoragetorch/_client.py` and `/code/src/azstoragetorch/io.py` shows that credentials are handled using Azure SDK's `DefaultAzureCredential`, `AzureSasCredential`, and URL-based SAS tokens. These are passed to the `azure.storage.blob.BlobClient` internally.
    - There is no code in the current version that would explicitly log these credentials in plaintext.
    - However, if future development introduces logging using standard Python logging libraries or similar mechanisms without careful consideration of security, there is a risk that connection strings could be logged.
    - For example, if debug logging is enabled and the library were to log the `blob_url` directly without sanitization, and the `blob_url` contains a SAS token, this token (which is a sensitive credential) could be logged in plaintext. Similarly, if connection string based authentication is added in future and logged for debugging, it would lead to the same vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
    - **Step 1:** Modify a future version of the library (assuming logging functionality is added) to intentionally log the Azure Storage connection string or SAS token in plaintext using a standard logging mechanism (e.g., `logging.debug`).  For example, in `/code/src/azstoragetorch/_client.py` or `/code/src/azstoragetorch/io.py`, add `_LOGGER.debug(f"Connection string: {blob_url_with_sas}")` or similar, where `blob_url_with_sas` represents a URL containing a SAS token or a connection string itself (if that authentication method is added later).
    - **Step 2:** Run an application that uses this modified version of the library and triggers the code path that executes the logging statement (e.g., reading a blob). Ensure debug logging is enabled in the application's logging configuration.
    - **Step 3:** Inspect the application's log files or log output.
    - **Step 4:** Verify that the Azure Storage connection string or SAS token is present in plaintext within the logs.
    - **Step 5:** If the connection string or SAS token is found in plaintext logs, this confirms the vulnerability.
    - **Step 6:** As an attacker, extract the plaintext connection string or SAS token from the logs.
    - **Step 7:** Use the extracted connection string or SAS token to authenticate to the Azure Storage account (e.g., using Azure Storage Explorer, Azure CLI, or Azure SDK for Python).
    - **Step 8:** Verify that you can successfully access and perform actions on the Azure Storage account using the stolen credentials, demonstrating a successful compromise.
