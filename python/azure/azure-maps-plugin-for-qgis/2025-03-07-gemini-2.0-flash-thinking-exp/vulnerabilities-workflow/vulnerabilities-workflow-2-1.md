### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability name: Insecure Deserialization in Feature Loading
- Description:
    1. An attacker could manipulate geospatial data received from Azure Maps, specifically within the FeatureCollection JSON response.
    2. By crafting a malicious GeoJSON response from Azure Maps (or by intercepting and modifying a legitimate response if man-in-the-middle is possible, though less likely for external attacker), the attacker can inject malicious properties or geometries into the FeatureCollection.
    3. When the plugin loads this data using `QgsVectorLayer(json.dumps(feature_collection), "temp", "ogr")`, QGIS OGR provider deserializes the GeoJSON.
    4. If the malicious GeoJSON contains properties or structures that exploit vulnerabilities in the OGR GeoJSON driver or QGIS core functionalities during deserialization, it could lead to arbitrary code execution when QGIS processes this crafted data.
    5. This is because QGIS and OGR might have vulnerabilities in how they parse and handle complex or unexpected GeoJSON structures, especially related to attribute handling or geometry processing.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the QGIS application. An attacker could potentially gain control over the user's machine, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions depending on the privileges of the user running QGIS.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The plugin directly passes the JSON response to QGIS for deserialization without any validation or sanitization of the geospatial data itself.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the GeoJSON data received from Azure Maps before passing it to QGIS for deserialization.
    - Use of secure deserialization practices, potentially involving schema validation or safer parsing libraries if available for geospatial data in QGIS Python environment.
    - Error handling and sandboxing during the deserialization process to limit the impact of potential exploits.
- Preconditions:
    - The plugin must be used to load data from an Azure Maps Dataset.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the GeoJSON response received by the plugin, either by controlling the Azure Maps service (less likely for external attacker) or through a man-in-the-middle attack (less likely for external attacker, but possible in some scenarios) or by providing a malicious dataset ID that points to attacker controlled data source (more likely scenario).
- Source code analysis:
    1. In `azure_maps_plugin.py`, the `load_items` function is responsible for loading features.
    2. The function receives `data_response` which is the raw JSON response from Azure Maps.
    3. `response_json = response["response"]` extracts the response body.
    4. `QgsVectorLayer(json.dumps(feature_collection), "temp", "ogr")` creates a temporary vector layer directly from the JSON string without any validation of the content of `feature_collection`.
    5. The `feature_collection` is derived directly from `response_json["features"]` after splitting by geometry type, still without validation of individual feature properties or geometries.
    ```python
    def load_items(self, name, response, collection_definition, group):
        ...
        response_json = response["response"]
        ...
        feature_collection_by_geometry_type, geometryCollectionList = self._split_response_by_geometry_type(response_json, geometryTypes)
        ...
        for geometryType, feature_collection in feature_collection_by_geometry_type.items():
            # Make a temporary layer with the feature_collection
            temp_layer = QgsVectorLayer(json.dumps(feature_collection), "temp", "ogr")
            ...
    ```
    6. The vulnerability lies in the direct use of `json.dumps(feature_collection)` as input to `QgsVectorLayer` with "ogr" provider, which relies on the security of the OGR GeoJSON driver and QGIS core to handle potentially malicious GeoJSON data.
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a mock Azure Maps endpoint or a local proxy that can intercept and modify responses from a real Azure Maps endpoint.
        - Install the Azure Maps Creator QGIS Plugin in QGIS.
    2. **Craft Malicious GeoJSON:**
        - Create a malicious GeoJSON FeatureCollection. This payload should be designed to exploit known or potential vulnerabilities in GeoJSON deserialization within QGIS/OGR. Examples could include:
            - Extremely long strings for attribute values to trigger buffer overflows (less likely in Python, but worth testing).
            - Nested or recursive structures in properties to cause excessive processing or stack overflows.
            - Malformed or invalid geometry definitions to trigger parsing errors that could be exploited.
            - Attempt to use constructor injection or other deserialization exploits if OGR/QGIS is known to be vulnerable to such attacks (requires deeper research into known QGIS/OGR vulnerabilities). For a simple test, excessively deep nesting might be sufficient.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "FeatureCollection",
          "features": [
            {
              "type": "Feature",
              "properties": {
                "name": "Malicious Feature",
                "description": "A" * 50000,  // Example: Very long string for property
                "malicious_property": { "nested": { "level1": { "level2": { "level3": "..." } } } } // Example: Deeply nested structure
              },
              "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [0, 0]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    3. **Modify Plugin Request:**
        - When the plugin requests data (e.g., by clicking "Get Features"), intercept the request using the mock endpoint or proxy.
        - Replace the legitimate Azure Maps GeoJSON response with the crafted malicious GeoJSON payload.
    4. **Load Data in QGIS:**
        - In the plugin dialog, enter valid (but potentially fake, if using mock endpoint) Azure Maps credentials and dataset ID that will trigger the intercepted request.
        - Click "Get Features".
    5. **Observe for Exploit:**
        - Monitor QGIS for crashes, unexpected behavior, or signs of code execution outside the intended plugin scope.
        - If successful, the vulnerability would manifest as QGIS crashing, hanging, or exhibiting other anomalous behavior due to the malicious GeoJSON. For a code execution exploit, more sophisticated payloads targeting specific vulnerabilities would be needed and the observation would involve verifying execution of injected code (e.g., by monitoring for network connections, file system changes, or unexpected system calls, but this is more complex to setup for a basic test case and proof of concept may require simpler crash or hang).
    6. **Expected Result:**
        - A successful exploit would demonstrate that the plugin is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a more precisely crafted malicious payload is used. A simpler outcome to demonstrate the vulnerability could be QGIS crashing or becoming unresponsive when loading the maliciously crafted GeoJSON data, indicating a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion or a parsing error that could be further exploited.
