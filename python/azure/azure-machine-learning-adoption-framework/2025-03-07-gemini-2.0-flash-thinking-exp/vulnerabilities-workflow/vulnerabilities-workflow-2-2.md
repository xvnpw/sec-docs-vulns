- Vulnerability Name: Malicious File Distribution through Document Replacement

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the GitHub repository. This could be achieved by compromising a contributor's account or exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository's infrastructure.
    2. The attacker replaces legitimate documentation files (e.g., .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .png) within the repository with malicious files. These malicious files are crafted to resemble the original documents but contain embedded malware.
    3. Unsuspecting users seeking guidance on Azure Machine Learning adoption are directed to this repository, potentially through search engine results, links from official Microsoft documentation, or social media.
    4. Users, trusting the repository as a source of official Microsoft documentation, download the seemingly legitimate files.
    5. Upon opening the downloaded malicious files, the embedded malware is executed on the user's system. This could be triggered by opening a document with macros enabled, viewing a specially crafted image, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the software used to open the file type.

- Impact:
    - Compromise of user systems: Users' computers can be infected with various types of malware, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, or spyware. This can lead to data theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information, system instability, and disruption of operations.
    - Reputational damage: If users are infected with malware after downloading files from this Microsoft-owned repository, it can severely damage Microsoft's reputation and erode trust in Azure Machine Learning resources.
    - Supply chain attack: The repository becomes a vector for distributing malware to users who rely on Microsoft's guidance for Azure Machine Learning adoption, potentially affecting numerous organizations and individuals.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly mentioned in the project files. The repository relies on standard GitHub security features such as access control for collaborators and the general security posture of the GitHub platform.
    - The `SECURITY.md` file provides instructions on how to report security vulnerabilities, indicating a commitment to security, but it does not prevent the described vulnerability.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Content Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the documentation files. This could include:
        - Digitally signing the document files to guarantee their origin and integrity.
        - Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) for each downloadable file on the README.md or a dedicated page, allowing users to verify the downloaded files' integrity.
    - **Repository Write Access Control & Monitoring:**
        - Enforce strict access control policies for repository contributors, following the principle of least privilege.
        - Implement monitoring and auditing of changes to the repository content to detect unauthorized modifications promptly.
        - Enable branch protection rules to require reviews for changes to critical branches (e.g., `main`).
    - **Regular Security Scanning:**
        - Implement automated security scanning of the repository content, including documentation files, to detect known malware signatures or suspicious content.
        - Regularly review the repository for any unexpected or unauthorized files.
    - **User Awareness and Security Guidance:**
        - Add a clear security warning in the README.md file, advising users to be cautious when downloading files from public repositories and to scan downloaded files with antivirus software before opening them.
        - Recommend best practices for verifying file integrity if checksums or digital signatures are implemented.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker gains write access to the GitHub repository.
    - Users are attracted to the repository and intend to download documentation files for Azure Machine Learning adoption guidance.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The project primarily consists of documentation files, scripts, and configuration files. The vulnerability does not stem from the source code itself but from the project's nature as a repository for downloadable content.
    - The `README.md` file serves as the entry point and prominently features links to various documentation files (Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs).
    - The file structure organizes documentation within subdirectories like `aml-adoption-framework/` and `web-service-migration-example/`, making it easy for attackers to locate and replace these files.
    - There are no scripts or automated processes within the provided code that perform any kind of integrity check or validation on the documentation files.
    - The `SECURITY.md` file focuses on reporting vulnerabilities in Microsoft-owned repositories but does not offer specific mitigations for this repository's content distribution vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Clone the GitHub repository to a local machine.
    2. **Malicious File Replacement:**
        - Choose a legitimate documentation file, for example, `aml-adoption-framework/aml-adoption-framework.docx`.
        - Create a malicious file of the same type (e.g., a `.docx` file with an embedded macro virus). There are tools available to create such files for testing purposes, or use a safely contained and previously analyzed malware sample.
        - Replace the legitimate `aml-adoption-framework.docx` in the local repository copy with the malicious `.docx` file, ensuring the filename remains the same.
    3. **Commit and Push (Simulated):** In a real attack scenario, the attacker would commit and push these changes to the repository. For testing purposes, this step can be simulated, or performed on a private fork or branch to avoid harming real users.
    4. **Download as User:**
        - Navigate to the repository's README.md in the local clone or the simulated compromised repository.
        - Locate the link to the replaced documentation file (`aml-adoption-framework/aml-adoption-framework.docx`).
        - Download the file as a typical user would.
    5. **Open and Execute (Simulated):**
        - Open the downloaded malicious document file on a test system, ideally in a virtual machine or sandbox environment to prevent actual system compromise.
        - If the malicious file contains a macro, enable macros if prompted (as a naive user might do).
        - Observe the execution of the malicious payload. This could manifest as:
            - Antivirus software detection and alert.
            - Unexpected system behavior, like creation of new files, network connections to external IPs (if the malware attempts a callback), or modifications to system settings (depending on the malware's nature).
    6. **Verification:**
        - Confirm that the malicious code within the replaced document executes as expected.
        - Verify if standard antivirus software detects the malicious file upon download or when opened.
        - Document the steps and observations, including screenshots or recordings of the malicious activity, as proof of concept.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker could leverage write access to the repository to distribute malware through replaced documentation files, confirming the vulnerability's existence and potential impact.
