- Vulnerability name: Malicious Excel Template Distribution
- Description:
    - An attacker could replace the legitimate `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file, linked in the project's `README.md`, with a malicious Excel file.
    - This malicious file could contain macros or other embedded threats.
    - A user, trusting the repository, might download and open this compromised Excel file.
    - Upon opening, the malicious content within the Excel file could execute.
- Impact:
    - If a user opens a malicious Excel file, it could lead to malware infection on their machine.
    - This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's system and data.
    - Potential impacts include data theft, system compromise, and further propagation of malware within the user's network.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project does not currently implement any specific mitigations to prevent the distribution of a malicious Excel file. While `SECURITY.md` provides general security reporting guidelines, it does not address this specific vulnerability.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Integrity Check: Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file. This could involve providing a checksum (like SHA256 hash) of the legitimate file in the `README.md` or a separate security file. Users could then manually verify the downloaded file against this checksum. Digital signatures would be a more robust solution if feasible.
    - Security Warning: Add a prominent security warning in the `README.md` near the link to the `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file. This warning should advise users about the potential risks of downloading and opening executable files, including Excel files with macros, from any source, even seemingly trusted repositories.  It should recommend users to scan the file with antivirus software before opening it.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must gain write access to the project's repository. This could be achieved through compromised maintainer credentials or exploiting a vulnerability in the repository's infrastructure.
    - The attacker needs to successfully replace the legitimate `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file in the repository with their crafted malicious version.
    - A user must trust the repository and download the `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file from the provided link.
    - The user must open the downloaded Excel file on their system, potentially without proper security precautions like antivirus scanning or macro execution warnings enabled.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the provided source code files for the Azure CLI extension or the R web service example.
    - The critical point of vulnerability is the `README.md` file, specifically the link to `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`.
    - File: `/code/README.md`
    ```markdown
    The Self-Assessment Survey template is available [here](./self-assessment-survey.xlsx). It lists the questions to consider before start adopt Azure Machine Learning.
    ```
    - An attacker compromising the repository could modify this file to replace the legitimate `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` with a malicious one, or replace the file itself at the relative path.
    - There are no code-based checks or security measures in place to validate the integrity or safety of the linked Excel file.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup: Assume an attacker has gained write access to the repository for testing purposes.
    2. Action:
        - The attacker creates a malicious Excel file named `self-assessment-survey.xlsx`. This file should contain a macro that, when enabled, executes a benign action for testing purposes (e.g., displaying a popup message box with "Malicious Macro Executed"). For a real attack scenario, this would be replaced with actual malware.
        - The attacker replaces the original `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file in the repository with this newly created malicious Excel file.
    3. Verification:
        - A test user navigates to the project's `README.md` file in the repository.
        - The test user clicks on the link to `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` and downloads the file to their local machine.
        - The test user opens the downloaded `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file using Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet software.
        - If prompted, the test user enables macros in the Excel file (attack scenario assumes social engineering or user negligence in security warnings).
        - Observe if the benign action defined in the malicious macro executes (e.g., the popup message "Malicious Macro Executed" is displayed).
    4. Expected Result: The macro within the `self-assessment-survey.xlsx` file executes, demonstrating that a malicious file could be distributed through the repository and potentially compromise users who download and open it. This confirms the vulnerability of Malicious Excel Template Distribution.
