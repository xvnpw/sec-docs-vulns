#### Vulnerability 2: Potential for Over-Permissive `orchestratorPAT` Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Over-Permissive `orchestratorPAT`
- **Description:**
    1. The GitOps Connector relies on an `orchestratorPAT` for authentication with Git repositories and CI/CD orchestrators.
    2. The documentation and implementation do not explicitly enforce or guide users towards configuring the `orchestratorPAT` with the principle of least privilege.
    3. Users might inadvertently create or use `orchestratorPAT`s with excessive permissions (e.g., full repository access, broad CI/CD pipeline management rights) beyond what the GitOps Connector minimally requires.
- **Impact:**
    - If an over-permissive `orchestratorPAT` is compromised (e.g., through Kubernetes Secret exposure as described in Vulnerability 1), the attacker gains access to a wider range of actions than necessary for the GitOps Connector's intended function.
    - This expanded access could enable attackers to:
        - Gain full control over the manifests repository, potentially modifying code, deleting branches, or exfiltrating sensitive data.
        - Manipulate CI/CD pipelines beyond triggering actions, such as modifying pipeline definitions, accessing sensitive build artifacts or secrets, or altering pipeline permissions.
        - Pivot to other resources and systems if the `orchestratorPAT` grants access beyond the Git repository and CI/CD orchestrator.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not include any mechanisms to enforce or guide users toward least privilege token configuration. Documentation mentions the need for `orchestratorPAT` but lacks specific guidance on required permissions.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Enhancement:** Clearly document the principle of least privilege for `orchestratorPAT` configuration. Specify the *minimum* required scopes or permissions for both Azure DevOps and GitHub PATs to enable Git commit status updates and CI/CD orchestrator notifications. Provide explicit examples of minimal permission sets.
    - **Input Validation and Warnings (Optional, more complex):** Consider adding code-level checks (though challenging to implement reliably) to detect potentially over-permissive tokens during GitOps Connector startup or configuration. If feasible, issue warnings in logs if the token appears to have excessive permissions beyond the minimally required set.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A user configures the GitOps Connector with an `orchestratorPAT` that grants more permissions than strictly necessary for the connector's functionality.
    - The over-permissive `orchestratorPAT` is then compromised (e.g., through Kubernetes Secret exposure).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The code in `/code/src/clients/github_client.py` and `/code/src/clients/azdo_client.py` utilizes the `orchestratorPAT` to authenticate API requests to GitHub and Azure DevOps.
    - The specific permissions required depend on the API endpoints being called. For Git commit status updates, the required permissions are relatively limited. However, if the token has broader scopes, it can be used for many other actions.
    - The code itself does not perform any checks or validation on the permissions associated with the `orchestratorPAT`. It relies on the user to provide a token that is sufficient for the connector's operation but ideally adheres to the principle of least privilege.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the GitOps Connector to a Kubernetes cluster.
        - Configure the GitOps Connector with an `orchestratorPAT` that is intentionally created with *overly broad permissions*. For example:
            - **For GitHub:** Create a PAT with the `repo` scope (grants full access to private/public repositories and organizations).
            - **For Azure DevOps:** Create a Full access PAT.
        - Compromise or obtain the `orchestratorPAT` (e.g., using the Kubernetes Secret exposure test case from Vulnerability 1).
    2. **Steps (Example for GitHub with `repo` scope token):**
        - Using the compromised `orchestratorPAT`, authenticate with the GitHub API.
        - Attempt to perform actions that should *not* be possible if the token was configured with only the minimal necessary permissions for commit status updates and dispatch events. Examples:
            - **Modify repository settings:** Use the GitHub API to change repository settings (e.g., repository name, description, default branch).
            - **Delete branches:** Attempt to delete branches in the manifests repository.
            - **Read sensitive files (if present):** If the manifests repository contains sensitive files (which it ideally shouldn't, but this tests the scope), attempt to download or access them via the API.
        - **Verification:** Successful execution of actions that exceed the expected minimal permissions for Git commit status updates and dispatch events demonstrates the vulnerability of using an over-permissive `orchestratorPAT`. Similar tests can be devised for Azure DevOps depending on the permissions granted to the PAT.
