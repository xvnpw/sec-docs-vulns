### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated GitOps Notification Endpoint
- Description:
    1. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint of the GitOps Connector.
    2. The `/gitopsphase` endpoint, as defined in `gitops_event_handler.py`, processes any incoming POST request without any authentication or authorization mechanism.
    3. The request payload, which is expected to be a JSON notification from a GitOps operator, is directly parsed and processed by the `gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase` function in `gitops_connector.py`.
    4. If the attacker crafts a malicious payload that mimics a valid GitOps operator notification, the GitOps Connector will process it as legitimate.
    5. This can lead to the GitOps Connector updating Git commit statuses with false information and potentially triggering unintended CI/CD pipeline actions based on the spoofed notification.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can manipulate the perceived deployment status in the Git repository by injecting arbitrary commit statuses.
    - This can mislead developers and operators about the actual state of deployments.
    - By crafting specific notifications, an attacker might be able to trigger CI/CD pipelines incorrectly, leading to unexpected deployments or other CI/CD actions.
    - In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could potentially use this to insert malicious code into the deployment pipeline if the CI/CD pipeline actions are not properly secured and rely on the Git commit status reported by the connector.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanism for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement authentication and authorization for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint to ensure that only legitimate GitOps operators can send notifications.
    - Mutual TLS (mTLS) could be used to establish secure and authenticated communication channels between the GitOps operator and the GitOps Connector.
    - API keys or tokens could be used to authenticate requests, requiring GitOps operators to include a valid key/token in their requests.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming notification data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Preconditions:
    - The GitOps Connector instance must be publicly accessible or reachable by the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to understand the expected format of GitOps operator notifications (which can be inferred from documentation and code).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/gitops_event_handler.py`:
        ```python
        @application.route("/gitopsphase", methods=['POST'])
        def gitopsphase():
            # ...
            payload = request.get_json()
            logging.debug(f'GitOps phase: {payload}')
            gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase(payload, req_time)
            # ...
        ```
        - The `/gitopsphase` route is defined with the `POST` method.
        - `request.get_json()` directly parses the JSON payload from the request body without any authentication or source verification.
        - `gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase(payload, req_time)` processes the payload. There is no check on the origin or authenticity of the request before processing.

    - `src/gitops_connector.py`:
        ```python
        def process_gitops_phase(self, phase_data, req_time):
            if self._gitops_operator.is_supported_message(phase_data):
                commit_id = self._gitops_operator.get_commit_id(phase_data)
                if not self._git_repository.is_commit_finished(commit_id):
                    self._queue_commit_statuses(phase_data, req_time)
                    self._notify_orchestrator(phase_data, commit_id)
            else:
                logging.debug(f'Message is not supported: {phase_data}')
        ```
        - `process_gitops_phase` checks if the message is supported by the GitOps operator using `_gitops_operator.is_supported_message(phase_data)`. However, this check only validates the structure of the message, not its origin.
        - The function proceeds to extract `commit_id`, queue commit statuses, and notify the orchestrator without verifying the source of `phase_data`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the GitOps Connector to a publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster or environment.
    2. Obtain the external IP address or hostname of the GitOps Connector service.
    3. Craft a malicious JSON payload that mimics a valid FluxCD or ArgoCD notification. For example, for FluxCD:
        ```json
        {
            "involvedObject": {
                "kind": "GitRepository"
            },
            "metadata": {
                "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:attacker-controlled-commit-id"
            },
            "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded",
            "message": "Spoofed success message"
        }
        ```
    4. Replace `attacker-controlled-commit-id` with a commit ID in a Git repository that the GitOps Connector is configured to monitor.
    5. Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint of the GitOps Connector with the crafted payload:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"involvedObject": {"kind": "GitRepository"}, "metadata": {"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:attacker-controlled-commit-id"}, "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded", "message": "Spoofed success message"}' http://<GitOps-Connector-External-IP>/gitopsphase
        ```
    6. Observe the Git commit statuses in the Git repository. The attacker-controlled commit ID should now have a "success" status reported by the GitOps Connector, even if no actual deployment occurred.
    7. Additionally, if CI/CD orchestrator notifications are configured based on deployment status, verify if a CI/CD pipeline is triggered incorrectly due to the spoofed notification.
