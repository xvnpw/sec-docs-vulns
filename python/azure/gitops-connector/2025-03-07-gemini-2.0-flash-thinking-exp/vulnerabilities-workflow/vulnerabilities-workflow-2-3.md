- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Endpoint for GitOps Phase Notifications
- **Description:**
  - The `/gitopsphase` endpoint, responsible for receiving GitOps operator notifications, lacks any form of authentication.
  - An attacker can send unauthenticated POST requests to this endpoint from any network.
  - By crafting a malicious JSON payload that mimics a legitimate notification from a supported GitOps operator (FluxCD or ArgoCD), an attacker can bypass the intended security mechanisms.
  - If the forged payload indicates a 'deployment success' or a similar completion state, the GitOps Connector will proceed to notify the configured CI/CD orchestrator (Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions).
  - This notification triggers actions within the CI/CD pipeline, such as resuming agentless tasks in Azure DevOps or dispatching events to GitHub Actions, which are designed to follow successful deployments.
  - By repeatedly sending forged 'success' notifications, an attacker can trigger numerous unintended CI/CD pipeline executions.
- **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions without proper authorization.
  - This can lead to the execution of malicious code within the CI/CD environment, as pipelines are designed to automate software delivery and often have elevated privileges.
  - An attacker could potentially compromise the entire software supply chain by injecting malicious steps into triggered pipelines, leading to supply chain attacks, data breaches, or denial of service within the CI/CD infrastructure.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The code does not implement any authentication or authorization checks for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Implement Authentication:** The most critical missing mitigation is the implementation of a robust authentication mechanism for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint. This could involve:
    - API Keys: Requiring a pre-shared secret key to be included in the request headers. This key would need to be securely configured and managed on both the GitOps operator and GitOps Connector sides.
    - Mutual TLS (mTLS): Implementing mutual TLS authentication to ensure that only authorized GitOps operators can communicate with the connector. This provides strong cryptographic authentication.
  - **Implement Authorization:** After authentication, implement authorization to verify that the sender is indeed a legitimate and authorized GitOps operator instance. This might involve verifying the source IP address or other identifying information of the sender.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a direct mitigation for unauthenticated access, robust validation and sanitization of the incoming JSON payload are crucial. This would help prevent potential injection attacks and ensure that only expected data structures and values are processed. Validate fields like `commit_id`, `phase`, `status`, and other relevant parameters against expected formats and values.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The GitOps Connector instance must be publicly accessible over the network.
  - The attacker must be able to discover or guess the URL of the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid JSON payload that mimics a notification from a supported GitOps operator (FluxCD or ArgoCD) to successfully trigger the vulnerability. This requires some understanding of the expected message format.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File: `/code/src/gitops_event_handler.py`**:
    - The `gitopsphase()` function is defined to handle POST requests to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
    - ```python
      @application.route("/gitopsphase", methods=['POST'])
      def gitopsphase():
          # Use per process timer to stash the time we got the request
          req_time = time.monotonic_ns()

          payload = request.get_json()

          logging.debug(f'GitOps phase: {payload}')

          gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase(payload, req_time)

          return f'GitOps phase: {payload}', 200
      ```
    - **Absence of Authentication:** There is no code within this function or in Flask application setup that implements any form of authentication or authorization. The endpoint is completely open to public access.
    - **Unvalidated Input:** The `payload = request.get_json()` line retrieves the JSON payload from the request body without any validation against a schema or expected format at this level. The payload is directly passed to `gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase()`.
  - **File: `/code/src/gitops_connector.py`**:
    - The `process_gitops_phase()` method performs some checks but does not address the lack of authentication:
    - ```python
      def process_gitops_phase(self, phase_data, req_time):
          if self._gitops_operator.is_supported_message(phase_data):
              commit_id = self._gitops_operator.get_commit_id(phase_data)
              if not self._git_repository.is_commit_finished(commit_id):
                  self._queue_commit_statuses(phase_data, req_time)
                  self._notify_orchestrator(phase_data, commit_id)
          else:
              logging.debug(f'Message is not supported: {phase_data}')
      ```
    - **`is_supported_message()` Check:** This check, implemented in `FluxGitopsOperator` and `ArgoGitopsOperator`, is intended to filter messages based on `kind` and `reason` (for FluxCD) or always return `True` (for ArgoCD). This is not a security measure and can be easily bypassed by crafting a payload with expected fields.
    - **`is_commit_finished()` Check:** This check verifies if a commit status is already 'finished' in the Git repository. While it might prevent redundant processing in some cases, it does not prevent the initial malicious request from being processed if the commit is not yet marked as finished.

    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Pre-requisites:**
     - Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the GitOps Connector.
     - Configure the GitOps Connector to use GitHub Actions as the CI/CD orchestrator.
     - Configure the GitOps Connector with a GitHub repository where GitHub Actions workflows are defined (this can be a test/dummy repository).
     - Create a GitHub Actions workflow in the test repository that is triggered by a `repository_dispatch` event with `event_type: sync-success`. A simple workflow that logs a message is sufficient for testing.
     - Obtain the public URL or IP address of the deployed GitOps Connector instance.
  2. **Steps:**
     - **Craft a Malicious Payload:** Create a JSON payload that mimics a successful deployment notification from FluxCD. For example:
       ```json
       {
         "involvedObject": {
           "kind": "Kustomization"
         },
         "metadata": {
           "kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
         },
         "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded",
         "message": "Reconciliation succeeded",
         "commitid": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
       }
       ```
       - Replace `"1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"` with a valid commit ID from your manifests repository (or any valid SHA-1 hash format).
     - **Send the Forged Request:** Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint of the GitOps Connector instance with the crafted JSON payload. Replace `<GitOps-Connector-Public-URL>` with the actual URL of your deployed GitOps Connector.
       ```bash
       curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"involvedObject": {"kind": "Kustomization"}, "metadata": {"kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"}, "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded", "message": "Reconciliation succeeded", "commitid": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"}' <GitOps-Connector-Public-URL>/gitopsphase
       ```
     - **Monitor GitHub Actions:** Go to the GitHub Actions tab of your test repository and check the workflow runs.
  3. **Expected Result:**
     - A new workflow run for the `repository_dispatch` event with `event_type: sync-success` should be initiated in your test GitHub repository.
     - This demonstrates that the attacker successfully triggered a GitHub Actions pipeline by sending an unauthenticated, forged notification to the GitOps Connector.
     - The HTTP response from the `curl` command should be `GitOps phase: ... , 200` indicating successful reception by the GitOps Connector.

This security test case validates the vulnerability by demonstrating that an external attacker can indeed trigger unintended CI/CD pipeline executions by exploiting the lack of authentication on the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
