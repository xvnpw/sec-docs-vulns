### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Unauthenticated GitOps Notification Endpoint

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated GitOps Notification Endpoint
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint of the GitOps Connector.
    2. The `/gitopsphase` endpoint, as defined in `gitops_event_handler.py`, processes any incoming POST request without any authentication or authorization mechanism.
    3. The request payload, which is expected to be a JSON notification from a GitOps operator, is directly parsed and processed by the `gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase` function in `gitops_connector.py`.
    4. If the attacker crafts a malicious payload that mimics a valid GitOps operator notification, the GitOps Connector will process it as legitimate.
    5. This can lead to the GitOps Connector updating Git commit statuses with false information and potentially triggering unintended CI/CD pipeline actions based on the spoofed notification.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can manipulate the perceived deployment status in the Git repository by injecting arbitrary commit statuses.
    - This can mislead developers and operators about the actual state of deployments.
    - By crafting specific notifications, an attacker might be able to trigger CI/CD pipelines incorrectly, leading to unexpected deployments or other CI/CD actions.
    - In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could potentially use this to insert malicious code into the deployment pipeline if the CI/CD pipeline actions are not properly secured and rely on the Git commit status reported by the connector.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanism for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement authentication and authorization for the `/gitopsphase` endpoint to ensure that only legitimate GitOps operators can send notifications.
    - Mutual TLS (mTLS) could be used to establish secure and authenticated communication channels between the GitOps operator and the GitOps Connector.
    - API keys or tokens could be used to authenticate requests, requiring GitOps operators to include a valid key/token in their requests.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming notification data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The GitOps Connector instance must be publicly accessible or reachable by the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to understand the expected format of GitOps operator notifications (which can be inferred from documentation and code).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `src/gitops_event_handler.py`:
        ```python
        @application.route("/gitopsphase", methods=['POST'])
        def gitopsphase():
            # ...
            payload = request.get_json()
            logging.debug(f'GitOps phase: {payload}')
            gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase(payload, req_time)
            # ...
        ```
        - The `/gitopsphase` route is defined with the `POST` method.
        - `request.get_json()` directly parses the JSON payload from the request body without any authentication or source verification.
        - `gitops_connector.process_gitops_phase(payload, req_time)` processes the payload. There is no check on the origin or authenticity of the request before processing.

    - `src/gitops_connector.py`:
        ```python
        def process_gitops_phase(self, phase_data, req_time):
            if self._gitops_operator.is_supported_message(phase_data):
                commit_id = self._gitops_operator.get_commit_id(phase_data)
                if not self._git_repository.is_commit_finished(commit_id):
                    self._queue_commit_statuses(phase_data, req_time)
                    self._notify_orchestrator(phase_data, commit_id)
            else:
                logging.debug(f'Message is not supported: {phase_data}')
        ```
        - `process_gitops_phase` checks if the message is supported by the GitOps operator using `_gitops_operator.is_supported_message(phase_data)`. However, this check only validates the structure of the message, not its origin.
        - The function proceeds to extract `commit_id`, queue commit statuses, and notify the orchestrator without verifying the source of `phase_data`.

        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the GitOps Connector to a publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster or environment.
    2. Obtain the external IP address or hostname of the GitOps Connector service.
    3. Craft a malicious JSON payload that mimics a valid FluxCD or ArgoCD notification. For example, for FluxCD:
        ```json
        {
            "involvedObject": {
                "kind": "GitRepository"
            },
            "metadata": {
                "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:attacker-controlled-commit-id"
            },
            "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded",
            "message": "Spoofed success message"
        }
        ```
    4. Replace `attacker-controlled-commit-id` with a commit ID in a Git repository that the GitOps Connector is configured to monitor.
    5. Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the `/gitopsphase` endpoint of the GitOps Connector with the crafted payload:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"involvedObject": {"kind": "GitRepository"}, "metadata": {"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main@sha1:attacker-controlled-commit-id"}, "reason": "ReconciliationSucceeded", "message": "Spoofed success message"}' http://<GitOps-Connector-External-IP>/gitopsphase
        ```
    6. Observe the Git commit statuses in the Git repository. The attacker-controlled commit ID should now have a "success" status reported by the GitOps Connector, even if no actual deployment occurred.
    7. Additionally, if CI/CD orchestrator notifications are configured based on deployment status, verify if a CI/CD pipeline is triggered incorrectly due to the spoofed notification.


#### Vulnerability 2: Personal Access Token (PAT) Exposure

- **Vulnerability Name:** Personal Access Token (PAT) Exposure
- **Description:**
    The GitOps Connector uses a Personal Access Token (PAT), configured via the `orchestratorPAT` Helm value and environment variable `PAT`, to authenticate and authorize API calls to Git repositories (Azure Repos or GitHub) and CI/CD orchestrators (Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions). If this PAT is compromised, an attacker can impersonate the GitOps Connector and perform unauthorized actions within the connected systems.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1.  An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kubernetes Secret `gitops-connector-secret` in the deployed namespace. This could be achieved through Kubernetes misconfigurations, container vulnerabilities, or insider threat.
    2.  The attacker extracts the Personal Access Token (PAT) from the `PAT` field within the `gitops-connector-secret`.
    3.  Using the compromised PAT, the attacker can now directly interact with the Git repository and/or CI/CD orchestrator APIs, bypassing the intended GitOps Connector functionality.
    4.  For example, if the PAT grants write access to the Git repository, the attacker could directly update commit statuses with malicious information.
    5.  If the PAT grants permissions to the CI/CD orchestrator, the attacker could trigger unauthorized pipeline runs or access sensitive data within the orchestrator.
- **Impact:**
    A compromised PAT allows an attacker to:
    1.  **Manipulate Git Commit Statuses:** Post arbitrary commit statuses (success, failure, pending, error) for any commit in the configured Git repository. This can disrupt observability, mislead users about deployment states, and potentially hide malicious activities.
    2.  **Trigger Unauthorized CI/CD Actions (GitHub Actions):** Dispatch repository events in the configured GitHub repository. This can trigger GitHub Actions workflows, potentially leading to unauthorized deployments, execution of malicious code within the CI/CD pipeline, or denial of service by overloading the CI/CD system.
    3.  **Potentially Access/Modify CI/CD Resources (Azure DevOps):** Depending on the scope of the PAT, gain unauthorized access to Azure DevOps resources, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification of build/release pipelines, or other malicious activities within the Azure DevOps organization.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   **Kubernetes Secrets:** The PAT is stored as a Kubernetes Secret (`gitops-connector-secret`), which is the recommended way to manage sensitive information in Kubernetes. (`/manifests/helm/templates/secret.yaml`)
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes (Implicit):** Kubernetes RBAC can be used to control access to Secrets, limiting who can read the `gitops-connector-secret`. (Not explicitly configured in provided files, but a standard Kubernetes security feature).
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for PAT:** The documentation and Helm chart should strongly emphasize the importance of creating a PAT with the minimum necessary permissions.  Specific required scopes for GitHub and Azure DevOps PATs should be clearly documented.
    *   **PAT Scope Documentation:**  Document the minimum required PAT scopes for each supported Git repository and CI/CD orchestrator type (Azure DevOps and GitHub). This will guide users to create least-privileged PATs.
    *   **Secret Rotation Guidance:**  Provide guidance on regular PAT rotation to limit the validity period of a potentially compromised token.
    *   **Auditing of PAT Usage:** Implement logging and monitoring of API calls made using the PAT. This would help in detecting suspicious activity if the PAT is compromised.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API calls made using the PAT to mitigate potential abuse if the PAT is compromised and used to trigger a large number of actions.
- **Preconditions:**
    1.  GitOps Connector instance must be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.
    2.  The `orchestratorPAT` value must be set during Helm installation, which is then stored as a Kubernetes Secret.
    3.  Attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster and the namespace where the GitOps Connector is deployed, or compromise the GitOps Connector container itself.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **PAT Retrieval:** In `src/clients/github_client.py` and `src/clients/azdo_client.py`, the PAT is retrieved from the environment variable `PAT` using `utils.getenv("PAT")`.
        ```python
        # src/clients/github_client.py
        class GitHubClient:
            def __init__(self):
                self.org_url = utils.getenv("GITHUB_ORG_URL")
                self.token = utils.getenv("PAT") # PAT is retrieved from environment variable
                self.headers = {'Authorization': f'token {self.token}'}
        ```
        ```python
        # src/clients/azdo_client.py
        class AzdoClient:
            def __init__(self):
                self.org_url = utils.getenv("AZDO_ORG_URL")
                token = base64.b64encode(f':{utils.getenv("PAT")}'.encode("ascii")).decode("ascii") # PAT is retrieved from environment variable
                self.headers = {'authorization': f'Basic {token}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        ```
    2.  **PAT Configuration as Secret:** The Helm chart templates (`/manifests/helm/templates/deployment.yaml` and `/manifests/helm/templates/secret.yaml`) configure the PAT to be loaded from a Kubernetes Secret.
        ```yaml
        # /manifests/helm/templates/deployment.yaml
        containers:
        - name: connector
          # ...
          env:
          # ...
            - name: PAT
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: gitops-connector-secret # Secret name
                  key: PAT # Key within the secret
        ```
        ```yaml
        # /manifests/helm/templates/secret.yaml
        {{ if .Values.orchestratorPAT  }}
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: gitops-connector-secret # Secret is named gitops-connector-secret
        stringData:
          PAT: {{  .Values.orchestratorPAT}} # PAT value is set from Helm value orchestratorPAT
        type: Opaque
        {{ end }}
        ```
    3.  **Helm Value Configuration:** The `orchestratorPAT` value is expected to be provided during Helm installation through `values.yaml` or command-line arguments. (`/manifests/helm/values.yaml`, `/README.md#installation`).
- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Deploy GitOps Connector using Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster.
        *   Configure `orchestratorPAT` with a PAT that has write access to a test GitHub repository.
        *   Ensure you have `kubectl` access to the cluster and namespace where GitOps Connector is deployed.
    2.  **Steps:**
        *   **Access the Secret:** Use `kubectl` to retrieve the secret `gitops-connector-secret` from the GitOps Connector namespace:
            ```bash
            kubectl get secret gitops-connector-secret -n <gitops-connector-namespace> -o yaml
            ```
        *   **Decode the PAT:** In the output YAML, find the `PAT` field under `data`. It will be base64 encoded. Decode it using `base64 -d`:
            ```bash
            echo "<base64-encoded-PAT>" | base64 -d
            ```
            This will reveal the plaintext PAT.
        *   **Exploit PAT - Manipulate Commit Status (GitHub Example):**
            *   Choose a commit ID from your test GitHub repository.
            *   Use `curl` to simulate posting a malicious commit status using the compromised PAT. Replace `<ORG_URL>`, `<REPO_NAME>`, `<COMMIT_ID>`, and `<YOUR_PAT>` with your test values:
                ```bash
                curl -X POST \
                  -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_PAT>" \
                  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                  -d '{"state": "failure", "description": "Malicious commit status", "context": "security-test"}' \
                  "<ORG_URL>/repos/<ORG_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>/statuses/<COMMIT_ID>"
                ```
                (Example `<ORG_URL>`: `https://api.github.com/repos`, `<ORG_NAME>`: your GitHub org, `<REPO_NAME>`: your test repo name).
        *   **Verify Manipulation:** Check the commit status for the chosen commit ID in your GitHub repository. You should see the "failure" status with the description "Malicious commit status" and context "security-test", posted using the compromised PAT.
- **Expected Result:**
        The attacker is able to successfully manipulate the commit status in the Git repository using the extracted PAT, demonstrating the vulnerability.


#### Vulnerability 3: Potential for Over-Permissive `orchestratorPAT` Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Over-Permissive `orchestratorPAT`
- **Description:**
    1. The GitOps Connector relies on an `orchestratorPAT` for authentication with Git repositories and CI/CD orchestrators.
    2. The documentation and implementation do not explicitly enforce or guide users towards configuring the `orchestratorPAT` with the principle of least privilege.
    3. Users might inadvertently create or use `orchestratorPAT`s with excessive permissions (e.g., full repository access, broad CI/CD pipeline management rights) beyond what the GitOps Connector minimally requires.
- **Impact:**
    - If an over-permissive `orchestratorPAT` is compromised (e.g., through Kubernetes Secret exposure as described in Vulnerability 2), the attacker gains access to a wider range of actions than necessary for the GitOps Connector's intended function.
    - This expanded access could enable attackers to:
        - Gain full control over the manifests repository, potentially modifying code, deleting branches, or exfiltrating sensitive data.
        - Manipulate CI/CD pipelines beyond triggering actions, such as modifying pipeline definitions, accessing sensitive build artifacts or secrets, or altering pipeline permissions.
        - Pivot to other resources and systems if the `orchestratorPAT` grants access beyond the Git repository and CI/CD orchestrator.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not include any mechanisms to enforce or guide users toward least privilege token configuration. Documentation mentions the need for `orchestratorPAT` but lacks specific guidance on required permissions.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Enhancement:** Clearly document the principle of least privilege for `orchestratorPAT` configuration. Specify the *minimum* required scopes or permissions for both Azure DevOps and GitHub PATs to enable Git commit status updates and CI/CD orchestrator notifications. Provide explicit examples of minimal permission sets.
    - **Input Validation and Warnings (Optional, more complex):** Consider adding code-level checks (though challenging to implement reliably) to detect potentially over-permissive tokens during GitOps Connector startup or configuration. If feasible, issue warnings in logs if the token appears to have excessive permissions beyond the minimally required set.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A user configures the GitOps Connector with an `orchestratorPAT` that grants more permissions than strictly necessary for the connector's functionality.
    - The over-permissive `orchestratorPAT` is then compromised (e.g., through Kubernetes Secret exposure).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The code in `/code/src/clients/github_client.py` and `/code/src/clients/azdo_client.py` utilizes the `orchestratorPAT` to authenticate API requests to GitHub and Azure DevOps.
    - The specific permissions required depend on the API endpoints being called. For Git commit status updates, the required permissions are relatively limited. However, if the token has broader scopes, it can be used for many other actions.
    - The code itself does not perform any checks or validation on the permissions associated with the `orchestratorPAT`. It relies on the user to provide a token that is sufficient for the connector's operation but ideally adheres to the principle of least privilege.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the GitOps Connector to a Kubernetes cluster.
        - Configure the GitOps Connector with an `orchestratorPAT` that is intentionally created with *overly broad permissions*. For example:
            - **For GitHub:** Create a PAT with the `repo` scope (grants full access to private/public repositories and organizations).
            - **For Azure DevOps:** Create a Full access PAT.
        - Compromise or obtain the `orchestratorPAT` (e.g., using the Kubernetes Secret exposure test case from Vulnerability 2).
    2. **Steps (Example for GitHub with `repo` scope token):**
        - Using the compromised `orchestratorPAT`, authenticate with the GitHub API.
        - Attempt to perform actions that should *not* be possible if the token was configured with only the minimal necessary permissions for commit status updates and dispatch events. Examples:
            - **Modify repository settings:** Use the GitHub API to change repository settings (e.g., repository name, description, default branch).
            - **Delete branches:** Attempt to delete branches in the manifests repository.
            - **Read sensitive files (if present):** If the manifests repository contains sensitive files (which it ideally shouldn't, but this tests the scope), attempt to download or access them via the API.
        - **Verification:** Successful execution of actions that exceed the expected minimal permissions for Git commit status updates and dispatch events demonstrates the vulnerability of using an over-permissive `orchestratorPAT`. Similar tests can be devised for Azure DevOps depending on the permissions granted to the PAT.
