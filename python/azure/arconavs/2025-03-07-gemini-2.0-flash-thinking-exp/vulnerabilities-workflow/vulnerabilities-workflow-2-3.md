Here is the updated list of vulnerabilities in markdown format:

* Vulnerability Name: Missing integrity check for downloaded govc binary
* Description:
    1. The `run.sh` script downloads the `govc` binary from a hardcoded URL on GitHub using `curl`.
    2. The downloaded archive is extracted using `gunzip`.
    3. The script directly executes the extracted `govc` binary without any integrity verification.
    4. An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or compromising the GitHub repository/release could replace the legitimate `govc` binary with a malicious one.
    5. If a user downloads and executes the compromised `run.sh` script, they will unknowingly download and execute the malicious `govc` binary.
* Impact:
    - Execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the script (likely root due to `sudo` usage).
    - Potential compromise of the vCenter environment if the malicious `govc` binary is designed to target it.
    - Potential lateral movement within the user's network.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The script downloads and executes the binary without any verification.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement integrity checks for the downloaded `govc` binary.
    - Use checksum verification (e.g., SHA256) to ensure the downloaded binary matches the expected, trusted version.
    - Host the checksum alongside the binary on the GitHub release page or a separate secure location.
    - Verify the checksum in the `run.sh` script before executing `govc`.
* Preconditions:
    - User must download and execute the `run.sh` script.
    - Attackers must be able to perform a MITM attack or compromise the source of the `govc` binary (GitHub release).
* Source code analysis:
    ```bash
    File: /code/src/run.sh

    ...
    if [ ! -f ".temp/govc" ]
    then
      echo "Downloading govc..."
      msg="failed to run apt-get or curl command"
      if [[ -n "$REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE" ]]; then
        msg="Please ensure $REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE is installed as a root certificate, by running 'sudo cp $REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ && sudo update-ca-certificates'"
      fi
      sudo -E apt-get -y update || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E apt-get -y install curl || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E apt-get -y install gzip || fail "$msg"
      URL_TO_BINARY="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz"
      curl -L $URL_TO_BINARY | gunzip > ./.temp/govc || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E chmod +x ./.temp/govc
    fi
    ...
    ```
    - The code block downloads `govc` using `curl -L $URL_TO_BINARY`.
    - It directly pipes the output to `gunzip` and then saves it as `.temp/govc`.
    - There is no step to verify the integrity of the downloaded content before execution.
* Security test case:
    1. Setup a malicious server that listens on the same port as `github.com` (or intercept traffic using a proxy for simplicity).
    2. When the script requests `https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz`, the malicious server responds with a crafted malicious `govc_linux_amd64.gz` file.
    3. Run the `run.sh` script on a test machine.
    4. Observe that the script downloads and executes the malicious `govc` binary from the attacker-controlled server.
    5. Verify that the malicious code within the replaced `govc` binary is executed on the test machine. For example, the malicious `govc` could be designed to create a file in `/tmp` or establish a reverse shell.

* Vulnerability Name: Missing integrity check for Azure CLI installation script
* Description:
    1. The `run.sh` script installs Azure CLI using a piped command: `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash`.
    2. This command fetches an installation script from `https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb` using `curl` and directly executes it using `sudo bash`.
    3. There is no integrity check on the downloaded script before it is executed with elevated privileges.
    4. An attacker performing a MITM attack or compromising `aka.ms` or the redirection target could replace the legitimate Azure CLI installation script with a malicious one.
    5. If a user downloads and executes the compromised `run.sh` script, they will unknowingly download and execute the malicious Azure CLI installation script with root privileges.
* Impact:
    - Execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system with root privileges.
    - Complete system compromise is possible as the malicious script runs with root permissions.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The script downloads and executes the installation script without any verification.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement integrity checks for the Azure CLI installation script.
    - Use checksum verification (e.g., SHA256 or GPG signature) to ensure the downloaded script matches the expected, trusted version.
    - Fetch the checksum from a separate secure location (ideally different domain than the script itself).
    - Verify the checksum in the `run.sh` script before executing the installation script.
    - Consider using package managers (like `apt-get install azure-cli`) where possible, as they usually handle integrity checks. However, this might reduce the script's compatibility across different Linux distributions.
* Preconditions:
    - User must download and execute the `run.sh` script.
    - Attackers must be able to perform a MITM attack or compromise the source of the Azure CLI installation script (`aka.ms` or redirection target).
* Source code analysis:
    ```bash
    File: /code/src/run.sh

    ...
    ( ( az version || (curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash) ) && ( az account get-access-token || az login --use-device-code ) ) || { echo 'az installation or login failed' ; fail; }
    ...
    ```
    - The code block attempts to install Azure CLI using `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash` if `az version` fails (meaning Azure CLI is not installed).
    - The output of `curl` is directly piped to `sudo bash`, executing the downloaded script with root privileges without any integrity checks.
* Security test case:
    1. Setup a malicious server that listens on the same port as `aka.ms` (or intercept traffic using a proxy).
    2. Configure the DNS to resolve `aka.ms` to the malicious server or intercept traffic using a proxy for simplicity.
    3. When the script requests `https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb`, the malicious server responds with a crafted malicious Azure CLI installation script.
    4. Run the `run.sh` script on a clean test machine that does not have Azure CLI installed.
    5. Observe that the script downloads and executes the malicious installation script from the attacker-controlled server with root privileges.
    6. Verify that the malicious code within the replaced installation script is executed on the test machine with root privileges. For example, the malicious script could be designed to add a new user with root privileges or install a backdoor service.
