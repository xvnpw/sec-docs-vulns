Each vulnerability is detailed below, including its description, potential impact, severity ranking, existing mitigations, recommended missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

### 1. Missing integrity check for downloaded govc binary

*   **Description:**
    1.  The `run.sh` script downloads the `govc` binary from a hardcoded URL on GitHub using `curl`.
    2.  The downloaded archive is extracted using `gunzip`.
    3.  The script directly executes the extracted `govc` binary without any integrity verification.
    4.  An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or compromising the GitHub repository/release could replace the legitimate `govc` binary with a malicious one.
    5.  If a user downloads and executes the compromised `run.sh` script, they will unknowingly download and execute the malicious `govc` binary.

*   **Impact:**
    - Execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the script (likely root due to `sudo` usage).
    - Potential compromise of the vCenter environment if the malicious `govc` binary is designed to target it.
    - Potential lateral movement within the user's network.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The script downloads and executes the binary without any verification.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement integrity checks for the downloaded `govc` binary.
    - Use checksum verification (e.g., SHA256) to ensure the downloaded binary matches the expected, trusted version.
    - Host the checksum alongside the binary on the GitHub release page or a separate secure location.
    - Verify the checksum in the `run.sh` script before executing `govc`.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - User must download and execute the `run.sh` script.
    - Attackers must be able to perform a MITM attack or compromise the source of the `govc` binary (GitHub release).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    ```bash
    File: /code/src/run.sh

    ...
    if [ ! -f ".temp/govc" ]
    then
      echo "Downloading govc..."
      msg="failed to run apt-get or curl command"
      if [[ -n "$REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE" ]]; then
        msg="Please ensure $REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE is installed as a root certificate, by running 'sudo cp $REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ && sudo update-ca-certificates'"
      fi
      sudo -E apt-get -y update || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E apt-get -y install curl || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E apt-get -y install gzip || fail "$msg"
      URL_TO_BINARY="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz"
      curl -L $URL_TO_BINARY | gunzip > ./.temp/govc || fail "$msg"
      sudo -E chmod +x ./.temp/govc
    fi
    ...
    ```
    - The code block downloads `govc` using `curl -L $URL_TO_BINARY`.
    - It directly pipes the output to `gunzip` and then saves it as `.temp/govc`.
    - There is no step to verify the integrity of the downloaded content before execution.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup a malicious server that listens on the same port as `github.com` (or intercept traffic using a proxy for simplicity).
    2. When the script requests `https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/download/v0.24.0/govc_linux_amd64.gz`, the malicious server responds with a crafted malicious `govc_linux_amd64.gz` file.
    3. Run the `run.sh` script on a test machine.
    4. Observe that the script downloads and executes the malicious `govc` binary from the attacker-controlled server.
    5. Verify that the malicious code within the replaced `govc` binary is executed on the test machine. For example, the malicious `govc` could be designed to create a file in `/tmp` or establish a reverse shell.

### 2. Missing integrity check for Azure CLI installation script

*   **Description:**
    1.  The `run.sh` script installs Azure CLI using a piped command: `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash`.
    2.  This command fetches an installation script from `https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb` using `curl` and directly executes it using `sudo bash`.
    3.  There is no integrity check on the downloaded script before it is executed with elevated privileges.
    4.  An attacker performing a MITM attack or compromising `aka.ms` or the redirection target could replace the legitimate Azure CLI installation script with a malicious one.
    5.  If a user downloads and executes the compromised `run.sh` script, they will unknowingly download and execute the malicious Azure CLI installation script with root privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    - Execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system with root privileges.
    - Complete system compromise is possible as the malicious script runs with root permissions.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The script downloads and executes the installation script without any verification.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement integrity checks for the Azure CLI installation script.
    - Use checksum verification (e.g., SHA256 or GPG signature) to ensure the downloaded script matches the expected, trusted version.
    - Fetch the checksum from a separate secure location (ideally different domain than the script itself).
    - Verify the checksum in the `run.sh` script before executing the installation script.
    - Consider using package managers (like `apt-get install azure-cli`) where possible, as they usually handle integrity checks. However, this might reduce the script's compatibility across different Linux distributions.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - User must download and execute the `run.sh` script.
    - Attackers must be able to perform a MITM attack or compromise the source of the Azure CLI installation script (`aka.ms` or redirection target).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    ```bash
    File: /code/src/run.sh

    ...
    ( ( az version || (curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash) ) && ( az account get-access-token || az login --use-device-code ) ) || { echo 'az installation or login failed' ; fail; }
    ...
    ```
    - The code block attempts to install Azure CLI using `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo -E bash` if `az version` fails (meaning Azure CLI is not installed).
    - The output of `curl` is directly piped to `sudo bash`, executing the downloaded script with root privileges without any integrity checks.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup a malicious server that listens on the same port as `aka.ms` (or intercept traffic using a proxy).
    2. Configure the DNS to resolve `aka.ms` to the malicious server or intercept traffic using a proxy for simplicity.
    3. When the script requests `https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb`, the malicious server responds with a crafted malicious Azure CLI installation script.
    4. Run the `run.sh` script on a clean test machine that does not have Azure CLI installed.
    5. Observe that the script downloads and executes the malicious installation script from the attacker-controlled server with root privileges.
    6. Verify that the malicious code within the replaced installation script is executed on the test machine with root privileges. For example, the malicious script could be designed to add a new user with root privileges or install a backdoor service.

### 3. Command Injection via Proxy Configuration in `run.sh`

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `config_avs.json` file.
    2. This file contains specially crafted values within the `managementProxyDetails` section, specifically in `http`, `https`, or `noProxy` fields.
    3. When `run.sh` script processes this malicious `config_avs.json` file, it uses `grep -Po` to extract proxy settings.
    4. Due to insufficient input validation and the use of shell commands to process the configuration, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. For example, by injecting backticks or command substitution within the proxy values.
    5. These injected commands are then executed by the shell when the script attempts to set proxy environment variables using `export`.

*   **Impact:**
    - **High**: Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the script, with the privileges of the script user (potentially root if run with `sudo`). This could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service. In the context of Azure VMware Solution integration, this could be used to compromise the management plane or connected Azure services if credentials are exposed or manipulated.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The script directly uses `grep -Po` and `export` without any sanitization of the values extracted from the configuration file.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: The script should validate and sanitize the proxy values extracted from `config_avs.json` to ensure they do not contain command injection characters or sequences.
    - Secure parsing: Instead of using `grep` and shell commands to parse JSON, use a dedicated JSON parsing tool within bash (like `jq`) or, ideally, move the proxy configuration logic into the Python script to leverage Python's safer JSON handling and string manipulation capabilities.
    - Principle of least privilege: While not directly mitigating the injection, running the script with the least necessary privileges would reduce the impact of a successful exploit. However, the script likely requires elevated privileges for some operations.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - The user must download and execute the `run.sh` script.
    - The user must be tricked into using a malicious `config_avs.json` file provided by the attacker.
    - The script must be executed in an environment where the user has permissions that the attacker wants to leverage.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/run.sh`
    - Vulnerable code section:
      ```bash
      if [ -n "$2" ] && [ -f "$2" ]
      then
        http_p=$(grep -A 20 "managementProxyDetails" "$2" | grep -Po '(?<="http": ")[^"]*')
        https_p=$(grep -A 20 "managementProxyDetails" "$2" | grep -Po '(?<="https": ")[^"]*')
        noproxy=$(grep -A 20 "managementProxyDetails" "$2" | grep -Po '(?<="noProxy": ")[^"]*')
        proxyCAInput=$(grep -A 20 "managementProxyDetails" "$2" | grep -Po '(?<="certificateFilePath": ")[^"]*')
        # ... (certificate file path processing) ...
        export http_proxy=$http_p
        export HTTP_PROXY=$http_p
        export https_proxy=$https_p
        export HTTPS_PROXY=$https_p
        export no_proxy=$noproxy
        export NO_PROXY=$noproxy
      fi
      ```
    - The script takes the second argument `$2` as the path to the configuration file.
    - It then uses `grep -A 20 "managementProxyDetails" "$2"` to extract the section related to proxy settings from the file specified by `$2`.
    - Subsequently, it uses `grep -Po '(?<="http": ")[^"]*'`, `grep -Po '(?<="https": ")[^"]*'`, and `grep -Po '(?<="noProxy": ")[^"]*'` to extract the values for `http`, `https`, and `noProxy` respectively. The `-P` option for `grep` enables Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, and `-o` option prints only the matched part.
    - The extracted values are assigned to variables `http_p`, `https_p`, and `noproxy`.
    - Finally, these variables are directly used in `export` commands to set environment variables like `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.
    - **Vulnerability**: An attacker can inject shell commands within the `config_avs.json` file in the `managementProxyDetails` section. For example, setting `http` to ``"`http://vulnerable.com`; malicious_command`"``. When `grep -Po '(?<="http": ")[^"]*'` extracts this value, it will include the injected command. When `export http_proxy=$http_p` is executed, the shell will interpret the backticks and execute `malicious_command`.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[run.sh starts] --> B{Check if config file path provided};
        B -- Yes --> C{grep proxy details from config file};
        C --> D{Extract http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy using grep -Po};
        D --> E{export http_proxy=$http_p};
        E --> F{export https_proxy=$https_p};
        F --> G{export no_proxy=$noproxy};
        G --> H[Continue script execution];
        B -- No --> H;
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious `config_avs.json` file with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "managementProxyDetails": {
           "http": "`touch /tmp/pwned`",
           "https": "https://normal-proxy.com",
           "noProxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1"
         },
         "subscriptionId": "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID",
         "resourceGroup": "YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP",
         "privateCloud": "YOUR_PRIVATE_CLOUD",
         "location": "westus2",
         "vCenterFQDN": "...",
         "vCenterUserName": "...",
         "vCenterPassword": "...",
         "staticIpNetworkDetails": {
           "networkForApplianceVM": "arc-segment-444",
           "networkCIDRForApplianceVM": "192.168.10.0/28"
         }
       }
       ```
    2. Save this file as `malicious_config_avs.json`.
    3. Execute the `run.sh` script with the malicious configuration file:
       ```bash
       sudo chmod +x run.sh
       sudo bash run.sh onboard malicious_config_avs.json
       ```
    4. After the script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, as the `touch /tmp/pwned` command injected through the `http` proxy setting was executed.
