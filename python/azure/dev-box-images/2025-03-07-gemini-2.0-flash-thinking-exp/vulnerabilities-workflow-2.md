## Vulnerabilities Found

### Vulnerability Name: **Packer Template Injection via Git Repository Modification**
**Description:**
1. An attacker forks the repository.
2. The attacker modifies a Packer template file (e.g., within `/images/*/`) to include malicious provisioning steps. This could involve adding a malicious script to be executed during the image build process. For example, the attacker could modify a shell script provisioner to download and execute malware.
3. The attacker creates a pull request with these malicious changes.
4. If a maintainer merges the pull request without careful review, the malicious Packer template is integrated into the main branch.
5. The automated workflow (`.github/workflows/build_images.yml`) detects changes in `/images` or `/scripts` and triggers a new image build using the modified Packer template.
6. The resulting custom VM image will contain the injected malware.
7. Users who deploy Dev Boxes from this compromised image will have their Dev Boxes infected with malware.
**Impact:**
- **Critical:**  Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the Dev Box VMs created from the compromised image. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration from Dev Boxes.
    - Credential theft from Dev Boxes.
    - Supply chain compromise by infecting developer environments.
    - Further propagation of malware within the organization's network.
**Vulnerability Rank:**
**Critical**
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Code review process for pull requests is the primary mitigation. However, this is a manual process and relies on the vigilance of the reviewers.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Automated Packer template scanning:** Implement automated static analysis tools to scan Packer templates for suspicious code or known malware patterns before merging pull requests or triggering builds.
- **Template integrity checks:** Implement a system to cryptographically sign and verify Packer templates to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
- **Restricted execution environment for Packer builds:** Run Packer builds in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential damage if a malicious template is executed.
**Preconditions:**
- Attacker needs to be able to fork the repository and create a pull request.
- A maintainer with write access needs to merge the malicious pull request.
- The automated build workflow must be triggered after the merge.
**Source Code Analysis:**
- **Workflow Trigger:** The workflow in `.github/workflows/build_images.yml` is triggered when files in `/images` or `/scripts` are changed. This means any modification to Packer templates within `/images/*/image.yml` or related scripts will initiate a build.
- **Packer Execution:** The `builder.py` script in `/builder/builder.py` is the entry point for the Docker container used for building images. It uses the `packer.py` module to execute Packer commands.
- **Template Loading:** Packer loads the template files from the specified image paths (e.g., `/images/VSCodeBox/image.yml`). If these template files are modified to include malicious provisioners, Packer will execute them during the build process.
- **No Input Sanitization:** There is no code in the provided files that sanitizes or validates the Packer template content before execution. The system relies solely on the assumption that the templates are trustworthy.
**Security Test Case:**
1. Fork the repository.
2. Navigate to `/code/images/VSCodeBox/` and modify the `image.yml` or create a new provisioner file (e.g., `evil_script.sh`) and reference it in `image.yml`.
3. Add a malicious command to the provisioner script to create a file named `INJECTED.txt` in the root of the C: drive within the VM image. For example, in a shell provisioner, add the line: `type C: > C:\INJECTED.txt`.
4. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request to the main repository with these changes.
6. (To expedite the test, you can manually trigger the `build_images.yml` workflow in your fork after making the changes, assuming you have the necessary secrets configured in your fork for testing purposes. In a real attack, the attacker would rely on a maintainer merging the PR).
7. Once the workflow completes successfully (or if you triggered it manually in your fork), the new image version will be published to the Azure Compute Gallery.
8. Deploy a Dev Box from this newly built image version.
9. Log in to the Dev Box and check if the file `C:\INJECTED.txt` exists. If it does, the malware injection via Packer template modification was successful.

### Vulnerability Name: **Insecure Version Bumping Script (`bump-version.py`)**
**Description:**
1. An attacker gains write access to the repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or insider threat).
2. The attacker modifies the `bump-version.py` script to include malicious code. For example, the attacker could add code to exfiltrate secrets, modify other files in the repository, or inject malware into the build process.
3. A maintainer or an automated process executes the modified `bump-version.py` script to update image versions.
4. The malicious code within `bump-version.py` is executed with the permissions of the user or process running the script. This could compromise the repository or the build environment.
**Impact:**
- **High:**  Compromise of the repository and build environment. Depending on the malicious code injected, the impact could range from data exfiltration to supply chain attacks by injecting malware into built images.
**Vulnerability Rank:**
**High**
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Code review process for changes to scripts. However, this is a manual process.
- Access control to the repository, limiting write access to trusted maintainers.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Code signing for scripts:** Digitally sign scripts like `bump-version.py` to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Implement checks to verify the script's signature before execution.
- **Restricted execution environment for scripts:** Run scripts like `bump-version.py` in a restricted environment with limited permissions to minimize the impact of a compromised script.
- **Automated script scanning:** Implement automated static analysis tools to scan scripts for suspicious code or vulnerabilities before execution.
**Preconditions:**
- Attacker needs write access to the repository to modify `bump-version.py`.
- The `bump-version.py` script needs to be executed by a user or automated process after the malicious modification.
**Source Code Analysis:**
- **Script Modification:** The `bump-version.py` script is a Python script that directly modifies `image.yml` files. If an attacker can modify this script, they can inject arbitrary code.
- **Unrestricted Execution:** The script is executed without any integrity checks or sandboxing. It runs with the permissions of the user executing it, which could be a maintainer or an automated system with significant privileges.
**Security Test Case:**
1. Gain write access to the repository (this step simulates an insider threat or compromised credentials).
2. Modify the `bump-version.py` script to include malicious code. For example, add code to print "INJECTED" to standard output whenever the script is run. Insert this line `print("INJECTED")` before the `print(f'bumping version for {image} {v.public} -> {n.public}')` line.
3. Commit and push the modified `bump-version.py` script.
4. Execute the `bump-version.py` script from your local environment (after cloning the repository with the malicious script): `python ./tools/bump-version.py`.
5. Check the output. If "INJECTED" is printed to the console, it confirms that the malicious code injected into `bump-version.py` is executed when the script is run. In a real attack, the injected code could perform more damaging actions.

### Vulnerability Name: **Potential Secret Exposure in Builder Logs**
**Description:**
The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, used to authenticate with Azure, might be inadvertently exposed in the builder logs. This can occur if logging is overly verbose, debug mode is enabled, or if error messages include sensitive environment variables or configuration details. If an attacker gains access to these logs, they could potentially extract the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret and gain unauthorized access to the Azure subscription.
**Impact:**
Credential Leakage. Exposure of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret would grant an attacker full control over the Azure resources managed by the Service Principal, leading to significant security breaches, data exfiltration, resource manipulation, and potential financial impact.
**Vulnerability Rank:**
**High**
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None evident from the provided code. The logging is configured in `builder/loggers.py`, but there is no mechanism to redact or prevent logging of sensitive information.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement secret redaction in the logging mechanism to automatically sanitize logs by masking or removing sensitive data like credentials before they are written to logs.
- Review and harden all scripts, especially Packer templates and provisioner scripts (not provided in project files), to ensure they do not inadvertently log sensitive information.
- Implement secure handling of environment variables to prevent accidental logging of secrets.
**Preconditions:**
- Verbose or debug logging is enabled in the builder environment.
- Errors occur during the image build process, potentially leading to the logging of debug information or environment variables.
- An attacker gains unauthorized access to the builder logs. This could be through compromised CI/CD pipeline access, misconfigured log storage, or other log management vulnerabilities.
**Source Code Analysis:**
- File: `/code/builder/loggers.py`
```python
import logging
import os
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path

timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')

# indicates if the script is running in the docker container
in_builder = os.environ.get('ACI_IMAGE_BUILDER', False)

repo = Path('/mnt/repo') if in_builder else Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
storage = Path('/mnt/storage') if in_builder else repo / '.local' / 'storage'

log_file = storage / f'log_{timestamp}.txt'


def getLogger(name, level=logging.DEBUG):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level=level)

    formatter = logging.Formatter('{asctime} [{name:^8}] {levelname:<8}: {message}', datefmt='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', style='{',)

    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setLevel(level=level)
    ch.setFormatter(formatter)

    logger.addHandler(ch)

    if in_builder and os.path.isdir(storage):
        fh = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
        fh.setLevel(level=level)
        fh.setFormatter(formatter)

        logger.addHandler(fh)

    return logger
```
The `loggers.py` file sets up basic logging using Python's `logging` module. It defines a formatter and handlers for both stream output and file output (when running in the builder container). However, it lacks any mechanism for secret redaction or filtering of sensitive information. If any part of the code or Packer configurations were to log the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` or related environment variables, they would be captured in the logs without any protection.
- Review of other scripts (`azure.py`, `builder.py`, `build.py`, `packer.py`): While the provided code doesn't explicitly log the secrets, the risk exists if these scripts or the Packer templates (not provided) were to inadvertently log environment variables or sensitive configuration data during error handling, debugging, or normal operation.
**Security Test Case:**
1. Modify the `/code/builder/azure.py` file to intentionally log the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. For example, add the following line within the `cli` function before the `subprocess.run` call:
```python
log.debug(f"Environment variables: {os.environ}")
```
This will log all environment variables, including potentially `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` if it's passed as an environment variable to the builder container.
2. Trigger a build workflow by modifying a file in the `/images` or `/scripts` directory to initiate a new build.
3. Access the logs of the GitHub Actions workflow run that performed the build.
4. Examine the logs for the "Environment variables:" entry added in step 1.
5. Verify if the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret (or parts of it, depending on how it's structured) is present in the logged environment variables. If the secret is found in the logs, it confirms the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Name: **Insecurely Stored Azure Credentials in Repository Secret**
**Description:**
1. A user forks the repository to build custom Dev Box images.
2. The project requires Azure credentials to be stored as a GitHub repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for authentication with Azure during the image build process.
3. If a user insufficiently secures this `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in their forked repository (e.g., by accidentally exposing it in workflow logs, committing it to the repository, or if their GitHub account is compromised), an attacker could potentially gain access to it.
4. An attacker who obtains the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret can then use these credentials to authenticate to Azure as the Service Principal defined in the secret.
5. With valid Azure credentials, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the associated Azure subscription and its resources, as the Service Principal is granted Contributor or Owner roles on the subscription or resource group as per the project documentation.
**Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to the Azure subscription associated with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
- Potential data breaches by accessing and exfiltrating data from Azure resources.
- Resource manipulation, including creating, modifying, or deleting Azure resources within the subscription.
- Denial of Service by disrupting or disabling Azure services.
- Financial losses due to unauthorized resource usage or malicious activities within the Azure subscription.
**Vulnerability Rank:**
**Critical**
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Documentation in the `/code/README.md` file explicitly warns users about the importance of securely managing the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secret.
- The documentation advises users to remove line breaks when pasting the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` value to prevent GitHub from incorrectly handling parts of the JSON as separate secrets, which is a specific GitHub behavior mitigation.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- The project lacks technical enforcement of secure secret management. It relies solely on user awareness and adherence to documentation.
- No automated checks or validation within the project to detect potential exposure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
- No built-in mechanisms to rotate or invalidate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in case of suspected compromise.
- The project does not offer alternative authentication methods that might be inherently more secure, such as Managed Identities (although Managed Identities might not be applicable in this specific workflow context of GitHub Actions and forked repositories).
**Preconditions:**
- A user must fork the repository to build custom Dev Box images.
- The user must create and configure an Azure Service Principal with Contributor or Owner roles on the target Azure subscription or resource group.
- The user must add the Service Principal's credentials as a repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in their forked repository.
- The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret must be insufficiently secured, leading to its exposure to an attacker.
**Source Code Analysis:**
- The provided source code does not directly handle or process the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within the Python scripts or YAML configurations.
- The vulnerability is not within the provided code itself but arises from the project's architecture and reliance on users to securely manage sensitive credentials outside of the codebase in GitHub Secrets.
- The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is intended to be used by GitHub Actions workflows (defined in `.github/workflows/build_images.yml`, which is not provided in PROJECT FILES, but referenced in `README.md`) to authenticate with Azure during the image building and deployment process.
- The risk is that if a user mismanages the secret in their forked repository, it could be exposed. The project's documentation attempts to mitigate this with warnings but does not enforce technical security measures.
**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:**
    - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
    - Create a dummy Azure Service Principal (for testing only, do not use production credentials).
    - In your forked repository, create a repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and set its value to the dummy Service Principal credentials.
    - Modify the `.github/workflows/build_images.yml` (if available or create a dummy workflow for testing) to intentionally echo the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within a workflow step.  **Important Security Note:** In a real security test, you would NOT expose the actual secret in this way. This step is for demonstration purposes only to simulate potential accidental exposure. For a safe test, you could log a hash of the secret or a fixed string to confirm secret access within the workflow context.
    ```yaml
    # Example modification in a workflow step (FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    - name: Echo Secret (INSECURE - FOR DEMO ONLY)
      run: echo "AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
    ```
2. **Trigger Workflow:**
    - Commit and push a change to your forked repository to trigger the workflow.
3. **Examine Workflow Logs:**
    - Go to the Actions tab in your forked repository and examine the logs of the workflow run.
    - **Observe:** In a properly secured setup, GitHub Actions should mask the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the logs, replacing it with `***`. However, if there's a misconfiguration or vulnerability (not in this project's code, but in the user's setup or GitHub Actions itself), the secret might be unintentionally exposed in plaintext or in a way that could be reconstructed.
4. **Simulate Attacker Access (Conceptual):**
    - Imagine an attacker gains unauthorized read access to your forked repository (e.g., through a compromised personal access token or if the repository is mistakenly made public).
    - The attacker could potentially review workflow configurations, attempt to extract secrets from logs (if exposure occurs due to misconfiguration or GitHub vulnerabilities), or try to infer secret values if not properly masked.
    - With a retrieved `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, the attacker could then use the Azure CLI or other Azure tools to authenticate to Azure using the compromised Service Principal credentials and gain access to the associated Azure subscription.

### Vulnerability Name: **Overly Permissive Service Principal Roles**
**Description:**
1. A user forks the repository to build custom Dev Box images.
2. Following the documentation, the user creates an Azure Service Principal to allow GitHub Actions workflow to interact with Azure.
3. The documentation suggests granting either "Contributor" role on the entire subscription OR "Owner" on a specific resource group and "Contributor" on the Azure Compute Gallery.
4. A user, misunderstanding the principle of least privilege or due to convenience, grants the "Owner" role at the subscription level to the Service Principal, instead of the least privileged option.
5. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the forked repository. This could be through various means such as compromising a maintainer's GitHub account, exploiting a vulnerability in the GitHub Actions workflow, or social engineering.
6. Once the attacker has repository access, they can potentially access the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, either directly (if repository secrets are misconfigured or accessible in forks, which is unlikely but worth considering) or indirectly by modifying the workflow to exfiltrate the secret (e.g., printing it to logs, sending it to an external endpoint).
7. With the leaked `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and the overly permissive "Owner" role, the attacker can now authenticate as the Service Principal and perform any action within the Azure subscription.
**Impact:**
- Complete control over the Azure subscription granted to the Service Principal.
- Ability to create, modify, and delete any Azure resources within the subscription.
- Potential for data exfiltration from Azure services (e.g., Storage Accounts, Databases).
- Possibility of denial-of-service by deleting critical resources.
- Lateral movement to other Azure resources or subscriptions if the compromised subscription has further access.
**Vulnerability Rank:**
**High**
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Documentation in `/code/README.md` mentions the **minimum required roles**: "Contributor" on the subscription OR "Owner" on a specific resource group and "Contributor" on the [Azure Compute Gallery][az-gallery] (and its resource group). This serves as a documentation-based guidance to users.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Least Privilege Enforcement Guidance:**  The documentation should strongly emphasize the principle of least privilege and explicitly recommend granting the least permissive roles necessary. Provide clear steps and examples for creating a custom role with the minimal required permissions instead of suggesting broad built-in roles like "Contributor" or "Owner" on the subscription.
- **Role Validation Automation:** Implement automated checks within the GitHub Actions workflow to validate the effective roles assigned to the Service Principal. The workflow could query Azure to determine the roles assigned to the Service Principal and issue a warning or fail the workflow if overly permissive roles like "Owner" at the subscription level are detected.
- **Secret Scanning Implementation:** Integrate secret scanning tools within the repository to proactively detect accidental commits of sensitive information, including potential credentials.
- **Enhanced Documentation Prominence:**  Make the security considerations and least privilege recommendations more prominent in the README.md, possibly by adding a dedicated "Security Considerations" section at the beginning of the document.
**Preconditions:**
- User forks the repository.
- User creates an Azure Service Principal.
- User grants overly permissive Azure roles (e.g., Owner role on the entire subscription) to the Service Principal.
- User configures the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secret in their forked repository with the Service Principal credentials.
- Attacker gains unauthorized access to the forked repository.
**Source Code Analysis:**
- `/code/README.md`: The file provides instructions on setting up the Service Principal and assigning roles.
```markdown
**IMPORTANT: Once you create a new Service Principal you must [assign it the following roles in RBAC][assign-rbac]:**:

- **Contributor** on the subscription used to provision resources, **OR**
- **Owner** on a specific (existing) resource group (see [Resource Group Usage](#resource-group-usage) below) and **Contributor** on the [Azure Compute Gallery][az-gallery] (and its resource group)
```
- The documentation, while mentioning roles, does not explicitly warn against granting overly broad permissions like "Owner" on the subscription and doesn't guide towards creating a least privilege custom role.
- No code within the provided project files (YAML configurations or Python scripts) actively checks or enforces the principle of least privilege for the Service Principal. The scripts are designed to function with valid Azure credentials, assuming the user has configured them correctly.
**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:**
    - Fork the repository.
    - Create an Azure Service Principal.
    - **Grant the "Owner" role** to the Service Principal at the subscription level in Azure.
    - Configure the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secret in your forked repository with the Service Principal's credentials (clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, subscriptionId).
    - Modify any file in the `/images` or `/scripts` directory to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/build_images.yml`. This will execute the image build process using the configured Service Principal.
2. **Simulate Repository Compromise and Secret Exfiltration:**
    - Assume an attacker gains access to your forked repository.
    - **Modify the GitHub Actions workflow** `.github/workflows/build_images.yml` to exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. Add a step to print the secret to the workflow logs for demonstration purposes:
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Display AZURE_CREDENTIALS Secret
        run: echo "AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
      - name: Build Images # (Original workflow step name)
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-images
        with:
          client_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS.clientId }}
          client_secret: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS.clientSecret }}
          subscription_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS.subscriptionId }}
          tenant_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS.tenantId }}
          repository: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}
          revision: ${{ github.sha }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```
    - Commit and push the modified workflow file to your forked repository. This will trigger the workflow execution.
3. **Retrieve Leaked Credentials:**
    - Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Find the latest workflow run triggered by your commit.
    - Examine the logs for the "Display AZURE_CREDENTIALS Secret" step. The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be printed in the logs (obfuscated by GitHub Actions, but still retrievable by someone with repository access if not properly handled in a real exfiltration scenario). In a real attack, the secret could be sent to an attacker-controlled server instead of being printed to logs.
4. **Demonstrate Impact - Unauthorized Azure Access:**
    - Using the leaked credentials (clientId, clientSecret, tenantId), use the Azure CLI to log in as the Service Principal:
    ```bash
    az login --service-principal -u <clientId> -p <clientSecret> --tenant <tenantId>
    ```
    - After successful login, execute Azure CLI commands to demonstrate the "Owner" level access. For example, list resource groups in the subscription:
    ```bash
    az group list
    ```
    - Or, attempt to create a new resource group:
    ```bash
    az group create -n attacker-created-rg -l eastus
    ```
    - If these commands are successful, it confirms that an attacker with the leaked `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and the "Owner" role can perform administrative actions on the Azure subscription, demonstrating the high impact of the vulnerability.
