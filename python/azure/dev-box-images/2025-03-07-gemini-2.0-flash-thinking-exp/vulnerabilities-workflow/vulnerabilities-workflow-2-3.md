### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecurely Stored Azure Credentials in Repository Secret
- Description:
    1. A user forks the repository to build custom Dev Box images.
    2. The project requires Azure credentials to be stored as a GitHub repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for authentication with Azure during the image build process.
    3. If a user insufficiently secures this `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in their forked repository (e.g., by accidentally exposing it in workflow logs, committing it to the repository, or if their GitHub account is compromised), an attacker could potentially gain access to it.
    4. An attacker who obtains the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret can then use these credentials to authenticate to Azure as the Service Principal defined in the secret.
    5. With valid Azure credentials, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the associated Azure subscription and its resources, as the Service Principal is granted Contributor or Owner roles on the subscription or resource group as per the project documentation.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure subscription associated with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - Potential data breaches by accessing and exfiltrating data from Azure resources.
    - Resource manipulation, including creating, modifying, or deleting Azure resources within the subscription.
    - Denial of Service by disrupting or disabling Azure services.
    - Financial losses due to unauthorized resource usage or malicious activities within the Azure subscription.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation in the `/code/README.md` file explicitly warns users about the importance of securely managing the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secret.
    - The documentation advises users to remove line breaks when pasting the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` value to prevent GitHub from incorrectly handling parts of the JSON as separate secrets, which is a specific GitHub behavior mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The project lacks technical enforcement of secure secret management. It relies solely on user awareness and adherence to documentation.
    - No automated checks or validation within the project to detect potential exposure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - No built-in mechanisms to rotate or invalidate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in case of suspected compromise.
    - The project does not offer alternative authentication methods that might be inherently more secure, such as Managed Identities (although Managed Identities might not be applicable in this specific workflow context of GitHub Actions and forked repositories).
- Preconditions:
    - A user must fork the repository to build custom Dev Box images.
    - The user must create and configure an Azure Service Principal with Contributor or Owner roles on the target Azure subscription or resource group.
    - The user must add the Service Principal's credentials as a repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in their forked repository.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret must be insufficiently secured, leading to its exposure to an attacker.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided source code does not directly handle or process the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within the Python scripts or YAML configurations.
    - The vulnerability is not within the provided code itself but arises from the project's architecture and reliance on users to securely manage sensitive credentials outside of the codebase in GitHub Secrets.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is intended to be used by GitHub Actions workflows (defined in `.github/workflows/build_images.yml`, which is not provided in PROJECT FILES, but referenced in `README.md`) to authenticate with Azure during the image building and deployment process.
    - The risk is that if a user mismanages the secret in their forked repository, it could be exposed. The project's documentation attempts to mitigate this with warnings but does not enforce technical security measures.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
        - Create a dummy Azure Service Principal (for testing only, do not use production credentials).
        - In your forked repository, create a repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and set its value to the dummy Service Principal credentials.
        - Modify the `.github/workflows/build_images.yml` (if available or create a dummy workflow for testing) to intentionally echo the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret within a workflow step.  **Important Security Note:** In a real security test, you would NOT expose the actual secret in this way. This step is for demonstration purposes only to simulate potential accidental exposure. For a safe test, you could log a hash of the secret or a fixed string to confirm secret access within the workflow context.
        ```yaml
        # Example modification in a workflow step (FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
        - name: Echo Secret (INSECURE - FOR DEMO ONLY)
          run: echo "AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
        ```
    2. **Trigger Workflow:**
        - Commit and push a change to your forked repository to trigger the workflow.
    3. **Examine Workflow Logs:**
        - Go to the Actions tab in your forked repository and examine the logs of the workflow run.
        - **Observe:** In a properly secured setup, GitHub Actions should mask the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the logs, replacing it with `***`. However, if there's a misconfiguration or vulnerability (not in this project's code, but in the user's setup or GitHub Actions itself), the secret might be unintentionally exposed in plaintext or in a way that could be reconstructed.
    4. **Simulate Attacker Access (Conceptual):**
        - Imagine an attacker gains unauthorized read access to your forked repository (e.g., through a compromised personal access token or if the repository is mistakenly made public).
        - The attacker could potentially review workflow configurations, attempt to extract secrets from logs (if exposure occurs due to misconfiguration or GitHub vulnerabilities), or try to infer secret values if not properly masked.
        - With a retrieved `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, the attacker could then use the Azure CLI or other Azure tools to authenticate to Azure using the compromised Service Principal credentials and gain access to the associated Azure subscription.

**Note:** This security test case is primarily to demonstrate the *risk* associated with insecure secret management and to highlight the reliance on user security practices. It does not directly test vulnerabilities *within* the provided project's code, but rather the security posture of the overall system when using this project, emphasizing the critical importance of secure `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` handling as documented.
