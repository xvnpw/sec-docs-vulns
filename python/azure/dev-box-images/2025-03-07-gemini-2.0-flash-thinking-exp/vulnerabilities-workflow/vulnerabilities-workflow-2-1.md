### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Packer Template Injection via Git Repository Modification**
- Description:
    1. An attacker forks the repository.
    2. The attacker modifies a Packer template file (e.g., within `/images/*/`) to include malicious provisioning steps. This could involve adding a malicious script to be executed during the image build process. For example, the attacker could modify a shell script provisioner to download and execute malware.
    3. The attacker creates a pull request with these malicious changes.
    4. If a maintainer merges the pull request without careful review, the malicious Packer template is integrated into the main branch.
    5. The automated workflow (`.github/workflows/build_images.yml`) detects changes in `/images` or `/scripts` and triggers a new image build using the modified Packer template.
    6. The resulting custom VM image will contain the injected malware.
    7. Users who deploy Dev Boxes from this compromised image will have their Dev Boxes infected with malware.
- Impact:
    - **Critical:**  Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the Dev Box VMs created from the compromised image. This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration from Dev Boxes.
        - Credential theft from Dev Boxes.
        - Supply chain compromise by infecting developer environments.
        - Further propagation of malware within the organization's network.
- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Code review process for pull requests is the primary mitigation. However, this is a manual process and relies on the vigilance of the reviewers.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Automated Packer template scanning:** Implement automated static analysis tools to scan Packer templates for suspicious code or known malware patterns before merging pull requests or triggering builds.
    - **Template integrity checks:** Implement a system to cryptographically sign and verify Packer templates to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    - **Restricted execution environment for Packer builds:** Run Packer builds in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential damage if a malicious template is executed.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to fork the repository and create a pull request.
    - A maintainer with write access needs to merge the malicious pull request.
    - The automated build workflow must be triggered after the merge.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Workflow Trigger:** The workflow in `.github/workflows/build_images.yml` is triggered when files in `/images` or `/scripts` are changed. This means any modification to Packer templates within `/images/*/image.yml` or related scripts will initiate a build.
    - **Packer Execution:** The `builder.py` script in `/builder/builder.py` is the entry point for the Docker container used for building images. It uses the `packer.py` module to execute Packer commands.
    - **Template Loading:** Packer loads the template files from the specified image paths (e.g., `/images/VSCodeBox/image.yml`). If these template files are modified to include malicious provisioners, Packer will execute them during the build process.
    - **No Input Sanitization:** There is no code in the provided files that sanitizes or validates the Packer template content before execution. The system relies solely on the assumption that the templates are trustworthy.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Navigate to `/code/images/VSCodeBox/` and modify the `image.yml` or create a new provisioner file (e.g., `evil_script.sh`) and reference it in `image.yml`.
    3. Add a malicious command to the provisioner script to create a file named `INJECTED.txt` in the root of the C: drive within the VM image. For example, in a shell provisioner, add the line: `type C: > C:\INJECTED.txt`.
    4. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.
    5. Create a pull request to the main repository with these changes.
    6. (To expedite the test, you can manually trigger the `build_images.yml` workflow in your fork after making the changes, assuming you have the necessary secrets configured in your fork for testing purposes. In a real attack, the attacker would rely on a maintainer merging the PR).
    7. Once the workflow completes successfully (or if you triggered it manually in your fork), the new image version will be published to the Azure Compute Gallery.
    8. Deploy a Dev Box from this newly built image version.
    9. Log in to the Dev Box and check if the file `C:\INJECTED.txt` exists. If it does, the malware injection via Packer template modification was successful.

- Vulnerability Name: **Insecure Version Bumping Script (`bump-version.py`)**
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains write access to the repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or insider threat).
    2. The attacker modifies the `bump-version.py` script to include malicious code. For example, the attacker could add code to exfiltrate secrets, modify other files in the repository, or inject malware into the build process.
    3. A maintainer or an automated process executes the modified `bump-version.py` script to update image versions.
    4. The malicious code within `bump-version.py` is executed with the permissions of the user or process running the script. This could compromise the repository or the build environment.
- Impact:
    - **High:**  Compromise of the repository and build environment. Depending on the malicious code injected, the impact could range from data exfiltration to supply chain attacks by injecting malware into built images.
- Vulnerability Rank: **High**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Code review process for changes to scripts. However, this is a manual process.
    - Access control to the repository, limiting write access to trusted maintainers.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Code signing for scripts:** Digitally sign scripts like `bump-version.py` to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Implement checks to verify the script's signature before execution.
    - **Restricted execution environment for scripts:** Run scripts like `bump-version.py` in a restricted environment with limited permissions to minimize the impact of a compromised script.
    - **Automated script scanning:** Implement automated static analysis tools to scan scripts for suspicious code or vulnerabilities before execution.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs write access to the repository to modify `bump-version.py`.
    - The `bump-version.py` script needs to be executed by a user or automated process after the malicious modification.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Script Modification:** The `bump-version.py` script is a Python script that directly modifies `image.yml` files. If an attacker can modify this script, they can inject arbitrary code.
    - **Unrestricted Execution:** The script is executed without any integrity checks or sandboxing. It runs with the permissions of the user executing it, which could be a maintainer or an automated system with significant privileges.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Gain write access to the repository (this step simulates an insider threat or compromised credentials).
    2. Modify the `bump-version.py` script to include malicious code. For example, add code to print "INJECTED" to standard output whenever the script is run. Insert this line `print("INJECTED")` before the `print(f'bumping version for {image} {v.public} -> {n.public}')` line.
    3. Commit and push the modified `bump-version.py` script.
    4. Execute the `bump-version.py` script from your local environment (after cloning the repository with the malicious script): `python ./tools/bump-version.py`.
    5. Check the output. If "INJECTED" is printed to the console, it confirms that the malicious code injected into `bump-version.py` is executed when the script is run. In a real attack, the injected code could perform more damaging actions.
