- vulnerability name: Command Injection in Generated Azure CLI Command Definitions
  - description: |
    An attacker can craft a malicious OpenAPI specification that, when processed by `aaz-dev-tools`, results in generated Azure CLI command definitions containing a command injection vulnerability. This occurs because the code generation process might not properly sanitize or validate certain fields from the OpenAPI specification, especially those related to descriptions, examples, or other string-based fields that are incorporated into the help messages or command structures of the generated CLI.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious OpenAPI specification. This specification includes carefully designed payloads within string fields (e.g., description, summary, examples) that, when processed by `aaz-dev-tools`, will be interpreted as commands when the generated CLI is used.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious OpenAPI specification to `aaz-dev-tools` for processing.
    3. `aaz-dev-tools` generates Azure CLI command definitions based on the malicious specification, unknowingly embedding the malicious payloads into the generated code (e.g., within help strings or indirectly in command execution logic if vulnerable code generation patterns exist).
    4. A user installs and uses the generated Azure CLI commands. When the vulnerable command is executed, or when a user requests help for the command (which might trigger the rendering of help strings containing the payload), the malicious payload is executed as part of the Azure CLI command, leading to command injection.
  - impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution on a user's system. When a user executes a seemingly benign Azure CLI command that was generated from a malicious OpenAPI specification, the injected commands are executed with the privileges of the user running the Azure CLI. In the context of Azure CLI, this could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to Azure resources managed by the user's Azure account.
    - Data exfiltration from Azure subscriptions.
    - Modification or deletion of Azure resources.
    - Lateral movement within the user's Azure environment if the compromised account has sufficient permissions.
    - Infiltration of the user's local system if the injected commands target local system operations.
  - vulnerability rank: critical
  - currently implemented mitigations:
    - The project description does not mention any specific mitigations against command injection vulnerabilities.
    - The provided files, which are examples of generated code and extension templates, do not contain explicit input sanitization or validation routines that would prevent command injection during code generation.
  - missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of all string inputs from OpenAPI specifications, especially fields used in code generation, to neutralize any potentially malicious command sequences.
    - Input validation: Validate OpenAPI specification inputs against a strict schema to ensure that only expected and safe data is processed.
    - Secure code generation practices: Review and harden the code generation logic to ensure that user-provided strings are not directly interpolated into executable code without proper encoding or escaping. Employ parameterized command execution methods where possible to avoid direct shell command construction from potentially tainted strings.
    - Context-aware output encoding: When incorporating user-provided strings into help messages or other outputs, use context-aware encoding to prevent them from being interpreted as executable commands.
  - preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious OpenAPI specification to a user who is running `aaz-dev-tools`. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising a system where OpenAPI specifications are processed by `aaz-dev-tools`.
    - The user must then use `aaz-dev-tools` to generate Azure CLI commands from this malicious specification.
    - The user or another victim must then execute the generated Azure CLI commands, or view help messages for these commands, on their system for the command injection to be triggered.
  - source code analysis: |
    The provided project files, such as `_update.py`, `_delete.py`, `_list.py`, `_show.py` for sentinel automation rules and databricks workspace commands (`_create.py`, `_update.py`, `_delete.py`, `_list.py`, `_show.py`), and extension test files (`manager_test.py`, `template_render_test.py`, `test_aaz_render.py`, `test_new_extension.py`, `manager_test.py`), are examples of generated Azure CLI command code and extension templates. They do not include the core code generation logic of `aaz-dev-tools` itself, which is responsible for processing OpenAPI specifications. Therefore, a direct source code analysis to pinpoint the command injection vulnerability within these files is not feasible.

    As previously hypothesized, the vulnerability likely exists within the modules of `aaz-dev-tools` that handle:
    1. Parsing OpenAPI specifications.
    2. Generating Azure CLI command definitions.
    3. Generating help messages for CLI commands.

    The risk is that these modules may directly embed unsanitized strings from the OpenAPI specification into the generated code, potentially leading to command injection. To confirm and precisely locate this vulnerability, a review of the `aaz-dev-tools`'s code generation modules is necessary.
  - security test case: |
    1. Setup test environment: Prepare an environment with `aaz-dev-tools` installed and configured for Azure CLI development as per the project's documentation (using a virtual environment, required repositories, etc.).
    2. Craft malicious OpenAPI specification: Create a YAML or JSON OpenAPI specification file. Within a description field of a schema or parameter, inject a malicious payload. For example, in a parameter description:

       ```yaml
       parameters:
         - name: resourceGroupName
           in: path
           required: true
           description: "Resource group name. $(malicious_command_here)" # Malicious payload injected
           schema:
             type: string
       ```
       Replace `$(malicious_command_here)` with a simple command for testing, such as `echo vulnerable > /tmp/vuln.txt`. For more sophisticated testing, use a command that attempts to exfiltrate data or execute a reverse shell.
    3. Import malicious specification: Use `aaz-dev-tools` workspace editor to import this crafted OpenAPI specification, adding the resource and commands to a workspace.
    4. Generate Azure CLI code: Use `aaz-dev-tools` CLI generator to generate Azure CLI command definitions for the module containing the newly imported resource.
    5. Install and test generated CLI extension: Install the generated Azure CLI extension in a test Azure CLI environment using `azdev extension add <extension_name>`.
    6. Execute vulnerable command and verify injection: Run the generated Azure CLI command. In this test case, try to trigger the help message for the command, as the description field is a likely injection point:

       ```bash
       az <module_name> <command_group> <command_name> --help
       ```
       or, if the injection point is within command execution logic, try a command execution:
       ```bash
       az <module_name> <command_group> <command_name> --resource-group testRG ...
       ```
    7. Check for command execution: Verify if the malicious command within the description field was executed. In the example above, check if the file `/tmp/vuln.txt` was created. For more advanced payloads, monitor for network connections or other indicators of successful command injection.

    Expected result: The malicious command injected in the OpenAPI specification should be executed when the generated Azure CLI command's help is displayed or when the command is executed, indicating a command injection vulnerability. If the test case was to create `/tmp/vuln.txt`, the file's existence would confirm the vulnerability.
