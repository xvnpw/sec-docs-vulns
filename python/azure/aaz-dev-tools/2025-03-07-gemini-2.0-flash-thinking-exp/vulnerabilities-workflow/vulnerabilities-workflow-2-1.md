- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe YAML loading in workspace editor
- Description:
An attacker could craft a malicious OpenAPI specification in YAML format that, when loaded by a developer using the `aaz-dev-tools` workspace editor, exploits a vulnerability in the YAML parser. This can be achieved by embedding malicious YAML directives within the OpenAPI specification that lead to arbitrary code execution during the parsing process.
Steps to trigger:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious OpenAPI specification in YAML format containing code execution payloads.
2. A developer, intending to generate Azure CLI commands, adds this malicious OpenAPI specification to the `aaz-dev-tools` workspace editor.
3. The `aaz-dev-tools` backend service parses the malicious YAML OpenAPI specification using an unsafe YAML loading function.
4. The malicious YAML directives are executed during the parsing process, leading to code execution on the developer's machine.
- Impact:
Local code execution on the developer's machine. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal sensitive information, such as credentials or source code.
    - Modify project files or configurations.
    - Install malware or backdoors.
    - Pivot to other systems accessible from the developer's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No specific mitigations are explicitly implemented in the provided project files to prevent unsafe YAML loading. The `SECURITY.md` file describes the general security reporting process but does not contain specific code-level mitigations.
- Missing Mitigations:
- Implement safe YAML loading practices by using secure YAML parsing libraries and avoiding functions known to be vulnerable to code execution, such as `yaml.load()` in Python without `SafeLoader`.
- Input validation and sanitization of OpenAPI specifications before parsing to detect and prevent malicious payloads.
- Sandboxing or isolation of the OpenAPI specification parsing process to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
- The attacker needs to create a malicious OpenAPI specification in YAML format.
- A developer must use `aaz-dev-tools` workspace editor and load the malicious OpenAPI specification.
- Source Code Analysis:
The provided project files do not contain the source code for the workspace editor or the backend service that parses OpenAPI specifications. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to pinpoint the exact location of the unsafe YAML loading vulnerability is not possible with the given information. However, based on the description of `aaz-dev-tools` as a "Python-based development tool" and the common vulnerabilities associated with YAML parsing in Python, it's plausible to assume that the backend service, possibly written in Python, might be using the `yaml.load()` function or similar unsafe methods to parse YAML OpenAPI specifications. This function is known to be vulnerable if not used with `SafeLoader` because it can execute arbitrary Python code embedded in the YAML data.
- Security Test Case:
1. Setup:
    - Install `aaz-dev-tools` locally as a developer.
    - Have access to a machine where you can safely test for code execution.
2. Craft Malicious OpenAPI Specification (YAML):
    Create a YAML file (e.g., `malicious_swagger.yaml`) with the following content that exploits unsafe YAML loading in Python:
    ```yaml
    swagger: "2.0"
    info:
      version: "1.0.0"
      title: "Malicious API"
      description: "Malicious OpenAPI Specification"
    paths:
      /vulnerable:
        get:
          summary: "Vulnerable endpoint"
          description: "This endpoint is part of a malicious specification."
          responses:
            "200":
              description: "Success"
              schema:
                type: "object"
                x-ms-code-generation-settings:
                  extensions:
                    python:
                      # Malicious payload to execute arbitrary code
                      namespace: !!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]
    ```
    Note: Replace `calc.exe` with a less intrusive command for testing in a non-Windows environment, like `touch /tmp/pwned`.
3. Start `aaz-dev-tools`:
    Run `aaz-dev run --cli-path <path_to_azure-cli> --cli-extension-path <path_to_azure-cli-extensions> --swagger-path <path_to_malicious_swagger.yaml> --aaz-path <path_to_aaz>`
    Replace placeholders with your local paths.
4. Add Workspace and Import Malicious Swagger:
    - Open the `aaz-dev-tools` workspace editor in your browser (usually http://localhost:8080).
    - Create a new workspace.
    - In the workspace editor, use the "Add Resources" functionality and select "Swagger Specification".
    - Choose "Upload Swagger File" and upload the `malicious_swagger.yaml` file you created.
    - Submit the file.
5. Observe for Code Execution:
    - Monitor your testing machine for signs of code execution.
    - If you used `calc.exe` on Windows, check if the calculator application starts.
    - If you used `touch /tmp/pwned` on Linux/macOS, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file is created.
6. Expected Result:
    If the vulnerability exists, the malicious payload embedded in the YAML file will be executed by the `aaz-dev-tools` backend during the OpenAPI specification parsing, resulting in the execution of `calc.exe` or the creation of `/tmp/pwned`. This confirms local code execution vulnerability.
