### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via `runconfig_python_file`

- Description:
    1. The GitHub Action allows users to train Machine Learning models on Azure using a Python script specified by the `runconfig_python_file` parameter.
    2. The `runconfig_python_file` parameter, which defaults to `"code/train/run_config.py"`, is taken as input without validation.
    3. The action uses `utils.load_runconfig_python` function to dynamically import and execute the Python script specified by `runconfig_python_file`.
    4. The `load_runconfig_python` function uses `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and `importlib.util.module_from_spec` to load and execute the Python file.
    5. This dynamic execution of user-controlled Python code allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the Azure Machine Learning environment.
    6. An attacker can modify the workflow file in a pull request or a branch they control, changing the `runconfig_python_file` parameter to point to a malicious Python script within the repository.
    7. When the GitHub Action runs, it will execute the attacker's malicious script, leading to arbitrary code execution in the Azure ML environment with the permissions of the Azure service principal configured for the action.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the Azure Machine Learning environment.
    - An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, including training data, models, and credentials.
    - The attacker could also manipulate the machine learning training process, inject backdoors into models, or pivot to other Azure services accessible by the service principal.
    - The impact is further amplified as the action runs in the context of Azure Machine Learning, potentially granting access to powerful cloud resources and data.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly loads and executes the Python file specified by the user-controlled `runconfig_python_file` parameter without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation**: The action should validate the `runconfig_python_file` parameter to ensure it points to a file within the repository and conforms to expected naming conventions. However, even validating the path is insufficient to prevent malicious code execution if the content of the file is not controlled.
    - **Code Review and Sandboxing**:  The action should not dynamically execute user-provided Python code directly. A safer approach would be to parse the configuration from the Python file (or any configuration file) and use a predefined and safe API to configure and submit the Azure ML run. Sandboxing the execution environment could also limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities, but is complex to implement in this context.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  The Azure service principal used by the GitHub Action should be granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. This would limit the potential damage an attacker could cause even if they achieve code execution. However, this is a general security best practice and not a specific mitigation for this vulnerability in the code itself.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the GitHub workflow file or influence the value of the `runconfig_python_file` parameter.
    - For public repositories, an attacker could submit a pull request with a modified workflow file.
    - For private repositories, an attacker would need to be a collaborator with write access or be able to compromise a collaborator's account.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`code/main.py`**: The `main()` function retrieves the `runconfig_python_file` parameter value from the environment variables, which is derived from the `parameters_file` input in `action.yml`.
    ```python
    parameters_file = os.environ.get("INPUT_PARAMETERS_FILE", default="run.json")
    ...
    run_config = load_runconfig_python(
        workspace=ws,
        runconfig_python_file=parameters.get("runconfig_python_file", "code/train/run_config.py"),
        runconfig_python_function_name=parameters.get("runconfig_python_function_name", "main")
    )
    ```
    2. **`code/utils.py`**: The `load_runconfig_python()` function is responsible for loading and executing the Python script.
    ```python
    def load_runconfig_python(workspace, runconfig_python_file, runconfig_python_function_name):
        root = os.environ.get("GITHUB_WORKSPACE", default=None)
        sys.path.insert(1, f"{root}")
        runconfig_python_file = f"{runconfig_python_file}.py" if not runconfig_python_file.endswith(".py") else runconfig_python_file
        try:
            run_config_spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(
                name="runmodule",
                location=runconfig_python_file
            )
            run_config_module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec=run_config_spec)
            run_config_spec.loader.exec_module(run_config_module) # Vulnerable line: Executes arbitrary code
            run_config_function = getattr(run_config_module, runconfig_python_function_name, None)
        ...
        try:
            run_config = run_config_function(workspace) # Executes function from loaded module
        ...
        return run_config
    ```
    - The line `run_config_spec.loader.exec_module(run_config_module)` uses `importlib` to execute the code from the file specified by `runconfig_python_file`. This is where the arbitrary code execution vulnerability lies, as there is no control over the content of this file.
    - The function `run_config_function` from the loaded module is then called, further executing code from the user-provided file.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the repository `Azure/aml-run` if it's public, or clone it if you have access.
    2. Modify the workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/integration_test.yml` or create a new one) to include the `aml-run` action.
    3. Create a malicious Python file, for example, in the repository at `code/malicious_run_config.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    import os
    from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

    def main(workspace):
        # Malicious code to execute - for example, write to a file in the outputs directory
        with open("outputs/pwned.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("You have been PWNED!")
        # Example of a benign run config to avoid workflow errors
        script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory=".", script="dummy_script.py")
        return script_config
    ```
    4. Create a dummy Python script `code/dummy_script.py` to be referenced in the benign `ScriptRunConfig` in the malicious file:
    ```python
    print("Dummy script execution")
    ```
    5. Modify the workflow file to set the `runconfig_python_file` parameter to point to the malicious script:
    ```yaml
    - uses: Azure/aml-run@v1
      id: aml_run
      with:
        azure_credentials: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        runconfig_python_file: "code/malicious_run_config.py"
    ```
    6. Commit and push these changes to your forked repository or a branch.
    7. Trigger the GitHub workflow (e.g., by pushing or creating a pull request).
    8. After the workflow run completes, check the logs and artifacts of the Azure ML run in the Azure Machine Learning Studio.
    9. Verify that the "pwned.txt" file has been created in the outputs of the run, confirming that the malicious code from `code/malicious_run_config.py` was executed within the Azure ML environment.
    10. Alternatively, check the workflow logs for any output from the malicious script, or any other actions performed by the malicious code.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can execute arbitrary code by controlling the `runconfig_python_file` parameter, confirming the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
