- Vulnerability Name: Potential Exposure of `azure_credentials` Secret via Ineffective Log Masking
- Description:
  - Step 1: A user configures a GitHub Actions workflow to use the `Azure/aml-workspace` action.
  - Step 2: The user provides Azure service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
  - Step 3: During workflow execution, the `main.py` script loads the `azure_credentials` from the environment variable.
  - Step 4: The script attempts to mask sensitive fields (tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, subscriptionId) using the `::add-mask::` command by printing to standard output.
  - Step 5: If the `::add-mask::` command is not fully effective in GitHub Actions logging, or if the `azure_credentials` are inadvertently logged in any way *before* the masking is applied, the secret could be exposed in the workflow logs.
  - Step 6: An attacker with access to the repository's workflow logs (e.g., collaborators in a private repository, or anyone if the repository is public and logging is not restricted) could potentially retrieve the unmasked `azure_credentials`.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of the `azure_credentials` secret.
  - With access to these credentials, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace associated with the service principal.
  - This unauthorized access could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the workspace, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or malicious activities within the Azure Machine Learning environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The action attempts to mask the `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` from the `azure_credentials` by using the `::add-mask::` command in the `mask_parameter` function within `code/code/utils.py`. This is intended to prevent the secrets from being displayed in GitHub Actions workflow logs.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - More robust logging controls to ensure no sensitive information is logged before masking is applied.
  - Thorough security testing to verify the effectiveness of `::add-mask::` in various GitHub Actions logging scenarios and configurations.
  - Consider alternative secret handling mechanisms that minimize the risk of accidental logging, such as using dedicated secret management tools or secure vault storage if feasible within the GitHub Actions environment.
- Preconditions:
  - The user must configure the `Azure/aml-workspace` action in a GitHub Actions workflow.
  - The user must provide the `azure_credentials` as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
  - Workflow logs must be accessible to potential attackers (e.g., repository is public, or collaborators are malicious, or misconfigured access controls).
  - The `::add-mask::` mechanism must be ineffective or circumvented, or secrets must be logged before masking is applied.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - In `/code/code/main.py`, the `azure_credentials` are loaded from the environment variable `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS`:
    ```python
    azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
    ```
  - The `mask_parameter` function from `/code/code/utils.py` is called for each sensitive field of the `azure_credentials` object:
    ```python
    mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
    mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
    mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
    mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))
    ```
  - The `mask_parameter` function in `/code/code/utils.py` implements masking by printing the `::add-mask::` command:
    ```python
    def mask_parameter(parameter):
        print(f"::add-mask::{parameter}")
    ```
  - **Vulnerability Point:** The reliance on `::add-mask::` might not be sufficient. If there are any logging mechanisms within the action's code or dependencies that output the `azure_credentials` *before* these `mask_parameter` calls are executed, or if `::add-mask::` is not completely effective in all logging scenarios, the secret could be exposed in the logs.  While the current code does not explicitly log the entire `azure_credentials` object before masking, future modifications or unforeseen logging behaviors might introduce such exposure. It's crucial to verify the robustness of this masking approach and ensure no other logging inadvertently reveals the secret.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Set up a public GitHub repository and configure a workflow to use the `Azure/aml-workspace@v1` action.
  - Step 2: Create an Azure service principal and obtain the `azure_credentials` JSON output.
  - Step 3: Add `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` as a secret to the GitHub repository.
  - Step 4: **Modify `/code/code/main.py` for testing purposes only**: Insert a `print` statement at the beginning of the `main()` function to log the entire `azure_credentials` object *before* any masking is applied:
    ```python
    def main():
        azure_credentials_raw = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}") # Added to capture raw credentials
        print(f"::debug::Raw Azure Credentials (before masking): {azure_credentials_raw}") # Added for testing - intentional logging before masking
        try:
            azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials_raw)
        except JSONDecodeError:
            # ... error handling ...
    ```
  - Step 5: Commit and push these changes to the test repository.
  - Step 6: Run the GitHub Actions workflow.
  - Step 7: After the workflow completes, examine the workflow logs.
  - Step 8: **Verify if the line `::debug::Raw Azure Credentials (before masking):` is present in the logs and if it contains the unmasked `azure_credentials` JSON, including the `clientSecret`.**
  - Expected Result: If the line from Step 8 is present in the logs and the `clientSecret` is visible, it demonstrates that the `azure_credentials` are logged in plain text *before* the masking mechanism is applied. This confirms the potential vulnerability of secret exposure through logs, even if debug logs are used. This test case simulates a scenario where intentional or unintentional logging before masking could expose secrets.
