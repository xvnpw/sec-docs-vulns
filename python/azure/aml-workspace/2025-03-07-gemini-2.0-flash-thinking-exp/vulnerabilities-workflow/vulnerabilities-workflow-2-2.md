### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Credential Exposure through Misconfigured `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` Secret
  - **Description:**
    - The Azure Machine Learning Workspace GitHub Action relies on the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret for authentication.
    - This secret, containing sensitive Azure Service Principal credentials (clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, subscriptionId), is passed as an input to the action via GitHub Secrets.
    - If the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is misconfigured with overly broad permissions (e.g., contributor role at subscription level instead of resource group or workspace level) or if it is unintentionally exposed (e.g., logged in workflow outputs, leaked outside of GitHub Secrets), an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - An attacker with access to these credentials could then perform actions within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, such as accessing sensitive data, manipulating machine learning models, or disrupting services.
  - **Impact:**
    - High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - This can result in:
      - Data breaches and exposure of sensitive machine learning data.
      - Manipulation or deletion of machine learning models and experiments.
      - Resource manipulation and potential financial impact due to unauthorized resource usage.
      - Reputational damage and loss of trust.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Secret Masking: The action uses `utils.mask_parameter` to mask the values of `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` in the logs. This is implemented in `/code/code/main.py`.
    - Schema Validation: The action validates the structure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON input against the `azure_credentials_schema` in `/code/code/schemas.py` using `utils.validate_json` in `/code/code/main.py`. This ensures that the input has the expected keys.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Principle of Least Privilege Guidance: The documentation (e.g., in `README.md`) should strongly emphasize the principle of least privilege when creating the service principal for `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. It should advise users to grant only the necessary permissions and scope the service principal to the specific resource group and workspace, rather than broader scopes like subscription contributor, which is suggested in the current README example.
    - Secret Leakage Prevention Guidance: The documentation should include explicit warnings against practices that could lead to unintentional exposure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, such as:
      - Avoid logging the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in workflow outputs.
      - Securely manage and store the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret only within GitHub Secrets and avoid copying or storing it in less secure locations.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user has configured the GitHub Action to use the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is either misconfigured with excessive permissions or becomes exposed outside of secure GitHub Secrets management.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/action.yml`: Defines `azure_credentials` as a required input, indicating its critical role in authentication.
    - `/code/code/entrypoint.sh`:  Executes the main Python script (`main.py`).
    - `/code/code/main.py`:
      - Lines 15-22: Reads the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
      - Lines 23-28: Parses the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON string. If parsing fails, an `AMLConfigurationException` is raised, but if successful, the parsed credentials object is used.
      - Lines 31-36: Validates the `azure_credentials` against the `azure_credentials_schema`. This validation only checks the structure of the JSON, not the permissions associated with the credentials.
      - Lines 39-42: Masks the credential parameters in logs using `mask_parameter` from `utils.py`. This is a basic mitigation to reduce accidental exposure in logs, but not a strong security control.
      - Lines 84-91: Creates a `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object using the `azure_credentials`. This object is then used to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning. If an attacker obtains a valid `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, they can instantiate `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` and gain programmatic access to the Azure ML workspace.
    - `/code/code/utils.py`:
      - `mask_parameter`:  Uses `::add-mask::` to mask parameters in GitHub Actions logs. This is a best-effort masking, but not foolproof and should not be considered a strong security measure.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a public GitHub repository and enable GitHub Actions.
    2. **Workflow Modification:** Create a workflow (e.g., in `.github/workflows/exploit.yml`) that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace@v1` action. Modify the workflow to intentionally log the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow output using an `echo` command with a warning level to ensure it's visible in logs, for example:
       ```yaml
       name: Log Secret Test
       on: push
       jobs:
         log_secret:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
             - name: Log Secret
               run: |
                 echo "::warning::EXPOSED_AZURE_CREDENTIALS=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
       ```
       Configure the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the repository settings.
    3. **Run Workflow:** Trigger the workflow by pushing a commit to the repository.
    4. **Examine Logs:** Go to the Actions tab of the public repository and view the workflow run logs for the "Log Secret Test" workflow. Despite the masking attempts within the action's code, the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be logged in the workflow output due to the intentional `echo` command. While the secret values might be partially masked in the UI, they are still present in the raw logs and could be extracted. In a real-world scenario, similar unintentional logging or misconfiguration could expose the secret.
    5. **Attempt Unauthorized Access (Manual):**
       - Copy the (partially masked but still exposed) `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON from the workflow logs.
       - Attempt to use these credentials to authenticate with Azure CLI or the Azure ML Python SDK from a separate machine or environment outside of GitHub Actions.
       - If successful in authenticating and accessing the Azure ML workspace, this demonstrates that exposure of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, even if partially masked in logs, can lead to unauthorized access.
