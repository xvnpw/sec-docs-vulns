- **Insecure Storage of Secrets in JSON File**

- Description:
    - The `secrets-to-json.sh` script retrieves sensitive information such as IoT Hub connection strings, device provisioning credentials, and application insights keys from Azure Key Vault.
    - After fetching these secrets, the script stores them in a JSON file named `_thief_secrets.json` located in the parent directory of the script (`/code/_thief_secrets.json`).
    - This JSON file is created on the file system of the machine where the script is executed.
    - If the machine where this script is run is compromised or if the file permissions on `_thief_secrets.json` are not properly restricted, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to these secrets.
    - An attacker with access to `_thief_secrets.json` could extract sensitive credentials and connection strings.
    - With these secrets, an attacker could potentially impersonate devices, send malicious telemetry data to the IoT Hub, or gain access to other Azure resources if the secrets grant broader permissions.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker gains access to the file system where the `secrets-to-json.sh` script has been executed. This could be due to various reasons, such as compromised developer workstation, misconfigured server, or insider threat.
        2. The attacker navigates to the `/code` directory within the project repository.
        3. The attacker locates and reads the `_thief_secrets.json` file.
        4. The attacker extracts sensitive information, such as `iothubConnectionString`, `deviceProvisioningHost`, `deviceGroupSymmetricKey`, `eventhubConnectionString`, and `appInsightsInstrumentationKey`, from the JSON file.
        5. The attacker uses these extracted secrets to perform malicious activities, such as injecting malicious telemetry data or gaining unauthorized access to Azure services.

- Impact:
    - Compromise of sensitive credentials, including IoT Hub connection strings and device provisioning keys.
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure IoT Hub and potentially other Azure resources.
    - Injection of malicious telemetry data into the IoT Hub, potentially leading to the compromise of backend systems processing this data.
    - Data breaches and unauthorized monitoring of IoT device communications.
    - Reputational damage and loss of trust.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The script `secrets-to-json.sh` is intended for developer workstations as mentioned in the source code comments: `# This script is intended for developer workstations.` This implies that it's not designed for production deployments, and the generated secrets file is meant for local development and testing purposes. This is a form of implicit mitigation by design, limiting the exposure to development environments.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Secure storage of secrets: Instead of storing secrets in a plain JSON file on disk, a more secure method like using a dedicated secrets management tool (e.g., Azure Key Vault SDK directly in code, HashiCorp Vault, or OS-level credential managers) should be implemented for local development as well.
    - File permission restrictions: The script does not explicitly set restrictive permissions on the `_thief_secrets.json` file. The script should ensure that the created JSON file has restricted permissions (e.g., read/write only for the user executing the script) to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
    - In-memory secret handling: Instead of writing secrets to disk at all, consider retrieving secrets directly into memory and using them without persisting them to a file, even for development purposes.
    - Warning in documentation: The documentation (e.g., README, SECURITY.md) should explicitly warn users about the insecure nature of storing secrets in `_thief_secrets.json` and advise against using this method in production or exposing the file to untrusted environments.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must gain access to the file system where the `secrets-to-json.sh` script has been executed and where the `_thief_secrets.json` file resides.
    - The `secrets-to-json.sh` script must have been executed at least once to generate the `_thief_secrets.json` file.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/scripts/secrets-to-json.sh`
    ```bash
    json_file="$(realpath ${script_dir}/..)/_thief_secrets.json"
    ...
    echo Secrets written to ${json_file}
    ```
    - This script defines the output JSON file path as `_thief_secrets.json` in the parent directory of the script's directory (`/code`).
    - The script fetches secrets using `az keyvault secret show` and then constructs a JSON object containing these secrets.
    ```bash
    echo ${JSON} | jq -S '.' > "${json_file}"
    ```
    - Finally, the script uses `jq` to write the JSON object containing all the fetched secrets into the `_thief_secrets.json` file.
    - There is no code in the script to set file permissions on `_thief_secrets.json` or to encrypt the secrets before writing them to the file.
    - The comment `# This script is intended for developer workstations.` acknowledges the limited scope but does not prevent misuse or accidental exposure in less secure developer environments.

- Security test case:
    - Precondition: Execute the `scripts/secrets-to-json.sh` script with valid `subscription_id` and `keyvault_name` to generate the `_thief_secrets.json` file.
    - Step-by-step test:
        1. As an attacker, gain access to the file system where the `secrets-to-json.sh` script was executed. For example, assume you have compromised a developer's workstation or have access to a shared development server.
        2. Navigate to the `/code` directory within the project repository.
        3. Locate the `_thief_secrets.json` file in the parent directory (`/code/_thief_secrets.json`).
        4. Open and read the contents of `_thief_secrets.json` using a text editor or command-line tool like `cat _thief_secrets.json`.
        5. Verify that the file contains sensitive information in plain text, such as `iothubConnectionString`, `deviceProvisioningHost`, `deviceGroupSymmetricKey`, `eventhubConnectionString`, and `appInsightsInstrumentationKey`.
        6. Copy the `iothubConnectionString` value.
        7. Use a tool like `az iot hub device-telemetry monitor --device-id <any_device_id> --hub-connection-string "<copied_iothubConnectionString>"` to monitor telemetry data from devices connected to the IoT Hub, demonstrating unauthorized access using the compromised secret.
    - Expected result: The test should confirm that `_thief_secrets.json` contains sensitive secrets in plain text and that these secrets can be used to gain unauthorized access to the Azure IoT Hub or inject malicious telemetry, proving the vulnerability.
