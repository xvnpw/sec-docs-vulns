### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Browser-Based GUI

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious application input or manipulates the application execution to generate output data containing malicious JavaScript code.
  2. This malicious data is stored in the `dataset.json` file as part of the application execution results, specifically within fields like `appinputs`, `appmetrics`, or task output logs.
  3. A user accesses the HPC Advisor's browser-based GUI and views analysis results, plots, or advice that are generated based on the data in `dataset.json`.
  4. The GUI, while rendering the analysis results, directly embeds the unsanitized malicious JavaScript code from `dataset.json` into the HTML of the webpage.
  5. When the user's browser loads the webpage, the malicious JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser session. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or displaying misleading information within the HPC Advisor GUI.

- Impact:
  - Account Compromise: An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking if the GUI has authentication or session management functionalities (though not evident in provided files).
  - Data Theft: Malicious JavaScript can be used to exfiltrate data displayed in the GUI or data accessible within the user's browser context.
  - Redirection to Malicious Sites: The injected script can redirect users to attacker-controlled websites, potentially leading to further phishing or malware attacks.
  - Defacement: The attacker can alter the content of the HPC Advisor GUI as seen by the user, displaying misleading or harmful information.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Based on the provided project files, there are no explicit mitigations implemented within the project to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in the browser-based GUI. The files focus on backend functionality, documentation, and example application setups, lacking any code related to GUI input sanitization or output encoding. The provided files do not contain any code for the GUI itself, so it's impossible to verify any mitigations in place within the GUI codebase from these files alone.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: The application needs to sanitize all data originating from application executions or user inputs before storing it in `dataset.json`. This involves encoding or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code.
  - Output Encoding: When displaying data from `dataset.json` in the browser-based GUI, the application must use proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to prevent the browser from interpreting data as executable code. This is crucial for data displayed in tables, text outputs, plots labels, and any other part of the GUI that renders data from the dataset.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate the impact of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can limit the actions an attacker can take even if they manage to inject malicious scripts.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to influence the input or output of an application execution managed by HPC Advisor. This could be through direct control over the application code, input parameters, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself.
  - A user must access the browser-based GUI and view analysis results that include the attacker's malicious data.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not include the source code for the browser-based GUI, making a direct source code analysis for XSS vulnerability impossible based on these files alone.
  - However, based on the project description and file structure, the following assumptions can be made:
    - The GUI is likely built using web technologies, potentially Python with Streamlit, as suggested by `pyproject.toml` and `src/hpcadvisor/main_gui.py`.
    - The GUI reads data from `dataset.json` to generate plots, advice, and display analysis results.
    - If the GUI directly embeds data from `dataset.json` into HTML without proper sanitization, it will be vulnerable to XSS.
    - For example, if the `appmetrics` or `appinputs` values from `dataset.json` are used to populate table cells or plot labels in the GUI, and these values are not HTML-encoded, then XSS is possible.

  - Visualization:
    ```
    [Application Execution] --> [Dataset Generation (dataset.json with potentially malicious data)] --> [HPC Advisor GUI (reads dataset.json)] --> [Browser (renders GUI with unsanitized data)] --> [XSS Vulnerability]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Deploy a publicly accessible instance of HPC Advisor, if possible based on provided files (though deployment instructions are focused on Azure Batch, not GUI deployment). Alternatively, set up a local development environment if GUI source code were available.
     - Prepare a user input file and application setup script for one of the example applications (e.g., matrixmult).
     - Modify the application setup script (`appsetup_matrix.sh` for matrixmult) to include malicious JavaScript in the output. For example, within `hpcadvisor_run()`, modify the output to include a line like: `echo "HPCADVISORVAR APPEXECTIME='<script>alert(\"XSS Vulnerability\")</script>'"` or modify application input within `ui_defaults.yaml` to include `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability")</script>` in `appinputs` values if those are reflected in output/dataset.
  2. **Execute Data Collection:**
     - Use the HPC Advisor CLI to run data collection for the modified application setup: `./hpcadvisor collect -n <deploymentname> -u <modified_ui_defaults.yaml>`.
  3. **Access GUI:**
     - Run the HPC Advisor GUI: `./hpcadvisor gui`.
     - Navigate to the sections in the GUI that display analysis results, plots, or advice (e.g., "View Plots" or "Get Advice").
     - Select the relevant data filter or deployment to view the results from the execution that included the malicious JavaScript.
  4. **Observe for XSS:**
     - Check if an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" (or the injected JavaScript payload) appears in the browser when viewing the analysis results in the GUI.
     - Inspect the HTML source code of the GUI page using browser developer tools to confirm if the malicious JavaScript code is directly embedded in the HTML, indicating a lack of output encoding.
  5. **Expected Result:**
     - If the alert box appears and the JavaScript code is embedded in the HTML, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that unsanitized data from `dataset.json` is being directly rendered in the GUI, allowing for JavaScript injection and execution within the user's browser.
