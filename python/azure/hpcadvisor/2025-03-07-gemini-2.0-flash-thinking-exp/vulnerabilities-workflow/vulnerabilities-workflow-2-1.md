### Vulnerability List for HPC Advisor Project

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in GUI via User Input

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious user input file (YAML format) containing Javascript code within a text field, for example, in the `appname` or `tags` fields.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious input file to the HPC Advisor tool via the `-u` flag when launching the GUI using the command `./hpcadvisor gui -u malicious_input.yaml`.
    3. The HPC Advisor GUI, upon processing this user input, might render the values from the YAML file on the web page without proper sanitization.
    4. If the GUI directly embeds these values into the HTML content, the malicious Javascript code from the input file will be executed within the user's browser when they access the GUI.
    5. This allows the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

* Impact:
    - Execution of malicious Javascript code in the victim's browser when they use the HPC Advisor GUI.
    - Potential cookie theft, session hijacking, and redirection to attacker-controlled websites.
    - Could lead to account compromise if session cookies are stolen.
    - Defacement of the GUI page.
    - Potential for further attacks against the user's system depending on the nature of the injected script.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided project files. The files focus on functionality and deployment, not input sanitization or security in the GUI. There is no code related to GUI rendering logic provided to confirm any mitigations.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and output encoding in the GUI code.
    - Context-aware output encoding should be applied when rendering user-provided data from the input YAML file in the HTML of the GUI.
    - Using a templating engine that automatically escapes HTML content by default.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a YAML input file.
    - The HPC Advisor GUI must be launched using the `./hpcadvisor gui -u <input_file>` command, processing the attacker's malicious input file.
    - A user must access the HPC Advisor GUI in their browser after it has processed the malicious input.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/docs/commands.md` and `/code/docs/gui.md`**: These files document the `gui` command and the `-u USERINPUT` option. This confirms that user input can be provided via a file to the GUI.
    2. **File: `/code/src/hpcadvisor/__main__.py`**: The `gui_handler` function is defined, which imports `main_gui.main(debug, userinput)`. This indicates that the `userinput` argument, derived from the `-u` flag, is passed to the GUI's main function.
    3. **File: `/code/src/hpcadvisor/main_gui.py`**: This file contains the Streamlit application code for the GUI. It shows that user input files are read using `utils.get_userinput_from_file(user_input_file)`.  The code then uses values from this `user_input` dictionary to pre-fill text input fields in the GUI (e.g., `text_subscription = st.text_input("Azure subscription", user_input["subscription"], type="password")`).
    4. **Vulnerable Point:** The vulnerability lies in how these values from `user_input` are rendered in the Streamlit application. If Streamlit directly renders these values as HTML without proper encoding, and if a user can inject Javascript code into these input values (e.g., in `ui_defaults.yaml`), then XSS is possible. For example, if the `appname` from `ui_defaults.yaml` is displayed directly in the GUI's HTML without sanitization, injecting `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` as the `appname` in the YAML could trigger an alert box in the user's browser.
    5. **Visualization:**
        ```
        [malicious_input.yaml] --> `./hpcadvisor gui -u malicious_input.yaml` --> [hpcadvisor GUI backend (Python)] --> [Streamlit GUI rendering] --> [User's Browser (XSS execution)]
        ```
        The user input from `malicious_input.yaml` flows through the HPC Advisor backend and is rendered by Streamlit. If this rendering is not secure, XSS occurs in the user's browser.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Input File (`malicious_input.yaml`):**
        ```yaml
        subscription: mysubscription
        skus: [Standard_HC44rs]
        rgprefix: xss-test
        appsetupurl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/hpcadvisor/main/examples/matrixmult/appsetup_matrix.sh
        nnodes: [2]
        appname: "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability in HPC Advisor GUI');</script> Malicious App Name"
        tags:
          appname: matrixmult
          version: v1
        region: southcentralus
        createjumpbox: false
        taskselector:
          policy: sequential
          paralleltasks: 1
        ppr: 100
        appinputs:
          appinteractions: 1
          appmatrixsize: [1000]
        ```
        Notice the `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability in HPC Advisor GUI');</script>` injected into the `appname` field.
    2. **Launch HPC Advisor GUI with Malicious Input:**
        Open a terminal and execute the command:
        ```bash
        ./hpcadvisor gui -u malicious_input.yaml
        ```
    3. **Access the GUI in a Browser:**
        Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the `hpcadvisor gui` command (typically `http://localhost:8501`).
    4. **Observe for XSS:**
        Check if an alert box appears in the browser with the message "XSS Vulnerability in HPC Advisor GUI". If the alert box appears, it confirms that the Javascript code injected in the `appname` field of `malicious_input.yaml` was executed, demonstrating a successful XSS attack.
    5. **Further Verification (Optional):**
        Inspect the HTML source code of the GUI page in the browser's developer tools. Search for the injected script or the `appname` value to confirm that it is being rendered in the HTML without proper encoding.
