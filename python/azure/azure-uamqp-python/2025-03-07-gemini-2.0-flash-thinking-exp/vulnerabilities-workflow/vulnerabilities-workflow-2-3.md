- Vulnerability name: CVE-2024-21646 - Integer Overflow in Payload Length Handling
- Description: An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow by sending a maliciously crafted AMQP message with a very large payload length to an application using a vulnerable version of the uAMQP-Python library. This is caused by an integer overflow in the library's C code when handling payload lengths during AMQP message parsing. The overflow leads to a small memory allocation followed by a larger memory copy, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system running an application using a vulnerable version of the uAMQP-Python library.
- Vulnerability rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: This vulnerability is mitigated in version 1.6.7 and later. Version 1.6.7 release notes in HISTORY.md explicitly mention "Fixes for CVE-2024-21646".
- Missing mitigations: Users using versions prior to 1.6.7 are still vulnerable and need to upgrade. No code-level mitigation exists in older versions.
- Preconditions:
  - The application must be running a version of uAMQP-Python prior to 1.6.7.
  - An attacker must be able to send maliciously crafted AMQP messages to the application.
- Source code analysis:
  - Due to the nature of the vulnerability (integer overflow in C code), a detailed source code analysis requires examining the C code responsible for parsing AMQP messages in versions prior to 1.6.7.
  - The vulnerability likely resides in the C code within `src/vendor/azure-uamqp-c/` or `src/vendor/azure-c-shared-utility/` where payload lengths are processed.
  - The code path would involve functions handling AMQP frame decoding and payload processing.
  - Without access to the vulnerable code version and the specific patch, a precise line-by-line analysis is not possible from the provided PROJECT FILES.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Set up a test environment with a Python application using a uAMQP-Python library version *prior to* 1.6.7. This application should be capable of receiving and processing AMQP messages.
  - Step 2: Use a tool like `scapy` or write a custom script to craft a malicious AMQP message. This message should have a crafted payload length field designed to cause an integer overflow in the vulnerable uAMQP library. The payload length should be set to a value that, when processed, results in a small memory allocation but a larger data copy.
  - Step 3: Send the crafted malicious AMQP message to the test application.
  - Step 4: Observe the application's behavior. In a vulnerable scenario, the application may crash due to a segmentation fault or exhibit other signs of memory corruption, indicating a heap buffer overflow. Use memory debugging tools like Valgrind for more detailed analysis and confirmation of the heap buffer overflow.
  - Step 5: Upgrade the uAMQP-Python library in the test environment to version 1.6.7 or later.
  - Step 6: Re-run the same test case with the upgraded library.
  - Step 7: Verify that the application no longer crashes or exhibits memory corruption when processing the malicious message, demonstrating that the vulnerability is mitigated in version 1.6.7 and later.
