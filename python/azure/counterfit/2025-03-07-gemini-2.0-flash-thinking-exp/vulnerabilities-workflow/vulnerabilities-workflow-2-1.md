* Vulnerability Name: Malicious Attack Configuration Import Vulnerability

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML attack configuration file. This file is designed to be imported into Counterfit.
    2. The malicious YAML file contains a modified `attack_class` parameter. Instead of pointing to a legitimate Counterfit attack class, it points to a malicious Python class controlled by the attacker. This malicious class could contain code to exfiltrate data, execute commands, or perform other unauthorized actions.
    3. The attacker tricks a Counterfit user into downloading and importing this malicious YAML configuration file into their Counterfit environment, for example by hosting it on a website or sending it via email.
    4. The user, intending to evaluate a new attack or share configurations, imports the malicious YAML file into Counterfit using the `set_attack` command or a similar mechanism that loads YAML configurations.
    5. Counterfit's code, designed to load attack configurations, uses `pydoc.locate` to dynamically import the class specified in the `attack_class` parameter of the YAML file.
    6. Due to the malicious YAML file, `pydoc.locate` imports and instantiates the attacker's malicious Python class.
    7. When the user attempts to run the imported attack configuration, Counterfit executes the code within the attacker's malicious class, leading to the execution of malicious code within the user's Counterfit environment. This could result in sensitive data exfiltration from the target system under assessment, or other unauthorized actions within the user's testing environment.

* Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the Counterfit user's environment. This could lead to:
    - Exfiltration of sensitive data from the machine learning system being tested.
    - Unauthorized access to the user's local system or network.
    - Compromise of the user's testing environment.
    - Lateral movement within the user's infrastructure if the testing environment is not properly isolated.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The project currently lacks any specific mitigations against this type of vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation of the `attack_class` parameter in YAML configuration files to ensure it only points to classes within a predefined allowlist of legitimate Counterfit attack classes. This validation should occur before attempting to import or instantiate the class.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Execute attack configurations within a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential impact of malicious code execution. This could involve using containers, virtual machines, or secure code execution environments.
    - Code review and security auditing: Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the attack configuration loading and execution mechanisms to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    - User warnings: Display clear warnings to users when importing attack configurations from untrusted sources, emphasizing the potential risks of executing untrusted code.
    - Digital signatures or integrity checks: Implement digital signatures or integrity checks for official Counterfit attack configuration files to allow users to verify the authenticity and integrity of configurations before importing them.

* Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must be able to create a malicious YAML attack configuration file.
    2. The attacker needs to trick a Counterfit user into importing this malicious YAML file into their Counterfit environment.
    3. The user must attempt to run the imported malicious attack configuration.

* Source Code Analysis:

    1. File: `/code/counterfit/frameworks/textattack/textattack.py`

    ```python
    class TextAttackFramework(CFFramework):
        # ...
        def build(self, target, attack: str):
            """ Build a new attack
            Note
                The attack comes in the format of "textattack.attack_recipes.deepwordbug_gao_2018.DeepWordBugGao2018"
            """
            class TextAttackWrapperObject(object):
                def __init__(self, predict_wrapper):
                    self.model = predict_wrapper

                def __call__(self, x):
                    return self.model(x)

            text_attack_obj = TextAttackWrapperObject(target.predict_wrapper)
            attack = pydoc.locate(attack) # [VULNERABLE CODE] - Dynamically loads class based on string from config
            new_attack = attack.build(text_attack_obj)
            return new_attack
    ```
    Visualization:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[YAML Attack Config File] --> B(TextAttackFramework.build)
        B --> C{pydoc.locate(attack)}
        C --> D[Dynamic Import of attack class from string]
        D --> E[Instantiation of attack class]
        E --> F[Return new_attack]
    ```

    - The `TextAttackFramework.build` function is responsible for building attack objects within the TextAttack framework.
    - It receives the `attack` parameter, which is a string representing the dotted path to the attack class (e.g., `"textattack.attack_recipes.deepwordbug_gao_2018.DeepWordBugGao2018"`). This string originates from the `attack_class` field in the YAML configuration files (e.g., `/code/counterfit/frameworks/textattack/attacks/deepwordbug_gao_2018.yml`).
    - The vulnerability lies in the use of `pydoc.locate(attack)`.  `pydoc.locate` dynamically imports a Python object (in this case, a class) given its path as a string. This is inherently unsafe when the input string (the `attack_class` from the YAML) is not strictly controlled because an attacker can manipulate this string to point to and execute arbitrary Python code.
    - If an attacker can modify the YAML configuration to change the `attack_class` to point to a malicious class they control, `pydoc.locate` will import and instantiate that malicious class.
    - When `new_attack = attack.build(text_attack_obj)` is called, if `attack` is a malicious class, the `build` method of the malicious class will be executed. If the attacker crafted the malicious class with harmful code in its `build` or `__init__` methods, this code will be executed within the Counterfit environment.

* Security Test Case:

    1. Create a malicious Python file named `malicious_attack.py` in a location accessible to the Counterfit environment (e.g., in the `/code/examples/terminal/commands/` directory for testing purposes).

    File: `/code/examples/terminal/commands/malicious_attack.py`
    ```python
    import os

    class MaliciousAttack:
        def __init__(self):
            # Malicious code to exfiltrate data (example: write to a file)
            with open("/tmp/exfiltrated_data.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Sensitive data exfiltrated!")
            print("[!] Malicious code executed!")

        def build(self, model_wrapper):
            return self # Return self so 'run' or similar method can be called

        def run(self, cfattack):
            print("[!] Run method of MaliciousAttack executed!")
            return ["Attack completed with malicious actions."]
    ```

    2. Create a malicious YAML attack configuration file named `malicious_attack.yml` in the `/code/counterfit/frameworks/textattack/attacks/` directory.

    File: `/code/counterfit/frameworks/textattack/attacks/malicious_attack.yml`
    ```yaml
    attack_category: evasion
    attack_class: examples.terminal.commands.malicious_attack.MaliciousAttack  # [MALICIOUS CLASS PATH]
    attack_data_tags:
    - text
    attack_docs: "This is a malicious attack configuration."
    attack_name: malicious_attack
    attack_parameters: {}
    attack_type: closed-box
    ```
    **Note**: The `attack_class` parameter is modified to point to the malicious class created in step 1. The path `examples.terminal.commands.malicious_attack.MaliciousAttack` assumes `malicious_attack.py` is placed in `/code/examples/terminal/commands/`. Adjust the path if you place the malicious file elsewhere, ensuring it's accessible within the Counterfit environment.

    3. Start the Counterfit terminal.

    ```bash
    $ counterfit
    ```

    4. List available attacks to confirm the malicious attack is loaded (it will be listed if placed in the correct directory and YAML is valid):

    ```
    counterfit> list attacks
    ```
    You should see `malicious_attack` in the list.

    5. Set the target to `movie_reviews` or any text-based target:

    ```
    counterfit> set_target movie_reviews
    ```

    6. Set the attack to the malicious attack:

    ```
    movie_reviews> set_attack malicious_attack
    ```

    7. Run the attack:

    ```
    movie_reviews>MaliciousAttack:xxxx> run
    ```

    8. Check for the impact:
        - Observe the Counterfit terminal output. You should see the "[!] Malicious code executed!" and "[!] Run method of MaliciousAttack executed!" messages printed, indicating that the malicious code within `MaliciousAttack` class has been executed.
        - Check for the file `/tmp/exfiltrated_data.txt`. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, this file should have been created and contain the text "Sensitive data exfiltrated!", confirming data exfiltration (in this example, simulated by writing to a file).

This test case demonstrates that by crafting a malicious YAML configuration and tricking a user into importing and running it, an attacker can execute arbitrary Python code within the Counterfit environment, confirming the Malicious Attack Configuration Import Vulnerability.
