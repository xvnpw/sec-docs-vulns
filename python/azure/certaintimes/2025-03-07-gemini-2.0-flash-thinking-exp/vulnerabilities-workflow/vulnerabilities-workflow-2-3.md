### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Log Injection via User Input

* Description:
    1. Run the `certaintimes` script.
    2. When prompted to enter text, provide a malicious input string that includes newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`) or other log injection payloads. For example: `malicious input\nsecond malicious line`.
    3. The application will log this input directly into the log file without sanitization.
    4. When the log file is processed by a log analysis system or script, the injected newline characters or payloads can be misinterpreted, leading to log manipulation or other unintended consequences.

* Impact:
    - Log manipulation: An attacker can inject arbitrary content into the log file, potentially forging log entries or altering existing ones.
    - Log corruption: Injected characters can break the expected log format, making log analysis and parsing difficult or unreliable.
    - Misleading log analysis: Injected log entries can mislead security monitoring, incident response, or debugging processes that rely on the integrity of the logs.
    - Potential for further exploitation: Depending on how the log files are processed, successful log injection might be a stepping stone for more severe attacks if the log processing system is vulnerable to the injected content (e.g., if logs are used to generate reports or trigger automated actions).

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application directly logs user input without any sanitization or encoding.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement input sanitization to escape or remove special characters from user-provided input before logging. Specifically, newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and any characters that could be interpreted as control characters by log processing systems should be handled.
    - Structured Logging: Consider using structured logging formats (like JSON) instead of plain text logs. Structured logging can help to avoid injection issues by treating log messages as data, rather than interpreting them as commands or format strings.
    - Input Validation: Implement input validation to restrict the characters allowed in user input, or to limit the length of input strings to prevent excessively long or malformed log entries.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to interact with the `certaintimes` script and provide input via standard input.
    - The log file generated by `certaintimes` must be processed or analyzed by another system or script that could be affected by the injected content.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/certaintimes/scripts/certaintimes.py`
    - Function: `main()`
    - Line 72: `line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`
        - This line reads user input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and removes trailing whitespace using `.rstrip()`. The input is stored in the `line` variable.
    - Line 77: `LOG.info("%s%s %s", prefix, elapsed, line)`
        - This line logs the user-provided `line` variable using `logging.info`. The `%s` format specifiers are used to insert the `prefix`, `elapsed` time, and the user input `line` into the log message.
        - **Vulnerability:** The code directly logs the `line` variable without any sanitization or encoding. This means that if a user provides input containing special characters, such as newline characters or control characters, these characters will be logged verbatim.
        - The `UTCFormatter` class is used for formatting the log messages, but it only handles timestamp formatting and does not perform any sanitization of the message content itself.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `certaintimes` script.
    2. Run the `certaintimes` script using `poetry run certaintimes` or `./certaintimes/scripts/certaintimes.py` if executable permissions are set.
    3. The script will prompt "Enter text to append it as a UTC timed log entry to certaintimes.log, q or quit to exit."
    4. Enter the following malicious input, including a newline character:
        ```text
        Test log message\nThis is an injected log line
        ```
    5. Press Enter. The script will display the elapsed time and the input.
    6. Enter `q` and press Enter to quit the script.
    7. Examine the `certaintimes.log` file (or `certaintimes-<observer>.log` if the `-o` option was used).
    8. Observe that the log file contains the injected newline, resulting in two separate log entries from a single input:
        ```log
        2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z 00:00:00 ====== Starting session ======
        2023-10-27T10:30:05.000Z 00:00:05 Test log message
        2023-10-27T10:30:05.000Z 00:00:05 This is an injected log line
        2023-10-27T10:30:06.000Z 00:00:06 ====== Ending session ======
        ```
    9. This test case demonstrates that newline characters are not sanitized and can be used to inject additional lines into the log file, confirming the log injection vulnerability.
