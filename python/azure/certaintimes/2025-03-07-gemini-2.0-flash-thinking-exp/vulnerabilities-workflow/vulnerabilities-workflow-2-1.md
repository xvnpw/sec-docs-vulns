### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Log Injection
- Description:
    - The `certaintimes` tool logs user-provided input directly into a log file without proper sanitization or encoding.
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the log file by providing specially crafted input through the command line interface.
    - Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
        1. Run the `certaintimes` script.
        2. When prompted to "Enter text to append...", input a malicious string containing special characters or format strings. For example, enter a string like `"Malicious log entry\n[CRITICAL] Attacker activity"` or `"Attacker: %(asctime)s Injected log"`.
        3. Type `q` or `quit` to end the session.
        4. Check the `certaintimes.log` file. The injected string will be logged as part of the log entry.
- Impact:
    - **Log Tampering:** Attackers can inject misleading or false information into the logs, potentially hiding malicious activities or misrepresenting events.
    - **Log Forgery:** Attackers can forge log entries that appear to be legitimate, making it difficult to trace actual events and potentially blaming legitimate users for malicious actions.
    - **Security Monitoring Evasion:** By injecting specific patterns, attackers might be able to evade detection by log monitoring and alerting systems that rely on pattern matching.
    - **Downstream Log Processing Exploitation:** If log files are processed by automated tools, injected content could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in those tools, depending on how they parse and interpret log data.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application directly logs user input without any sanitization or encoding.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or escape special characters that could be misinterpreted in logs or by log analysis tools. Consider escaping newline characters, carriage returns, and format specifiers.
    - **Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., using JSON format) instead of plain text logs. This would separate user-provided data from log metadata and make parsing more robust and less susceptible to injection.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and reject or sanitize input that contains unexpected or potentially malicious content.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `certaintimes` command-line tool, which is the intended use case of the application.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/certaintimes/scripts/certaintimes.py`
    ```python
    def main():
        # ...
        while True:
            line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip() # [1] User input is read here
            elapsed = tracker.elapsed_hms
            if line in ["quit", "q"]:
                LOG.info("%s%s ====== Ending session ======", prefix, elapsed)
                break
            print("{} {}".format(elapsed, line))
            LOG.info("%s%s %s", prefix, elapsed, line) # [2] User input is logged here without sanitization
        logging.shutdown()
    ```
    - [1] The `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()` reads a line of text from the user's input and removes trailing whitespace. This is the point where user-controlled data enters the application.
    - [2] The `line` variable, containing the user input, is directly passed as an argument to `LOG.info`. The logging format string `"%s%s %s"` in `LOG.info` treats the input as a string (`%s`) and inserts it into the log message. There is no encoding or sanitization of the `line` before logging. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the log file.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Run the `certaintimes` script from the command line: `poetry run certaintimes`
    - Step 2: Enter the following input when prompted: `Malicious input with newline\nand format string %(levelname)s`
    - Step 3: Enter `q` to quit the application.
    - Step 4: Examine the `certaintimes.log` file.
    - Step 5: Verify that the log file contains the injected input, including the newline character and the format string:
    ```log
    ...
    2024-01-20T10:00:00.000Z 00:00:05 Malicious input with newline
    and format string %(levelname)s
    ...
    ```
    - Step 6: Observe that the newline character is interpreted as a newline in the log file, and while `%(levelname)s` is not directly interpreted by the python logging in this context because it's treated as a literal string due to the use of `%s` in `LOG.info`, more sophisticated log analysis tools might misinterpret or be vulnerable to format strings or other injected content depending on their parsing logic. A more impactful injection could involve control characters or specific patterns that trigger vulnerabilities in downstream log processing systems if they exist. For instance, if a system is looking for specific strings to trigger alerts, an attacker could inject those strings to create false alarms or, conversely, inject strings to mask real attacks.
