### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Azure AD Application Secret

    *   **Description:**
        1.  A user configures the Splunk Addon for Azure Data Explorer by providing Azure AD Application credentials, including the Application Client Secret, through the Splunk UI as described in the README.md.
        2.  The Splunk Addon stores these configuration parameters, including the sensitive Application Client Secret, within Splunk's configuration files.
        3.  An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Splunk server's filesystem or Splunk Web UI (with sufficient privileges) can retrieve the stored configuration.
        4.  The attacker extracts the plaintext or reversibly encrypted Application Client Secret from the Splunk configuration.
        5.  Using the compromised Application Client Secret, along with the Application Client ID and Tenant ID, the attacker can authenticate to the legitimate Azure Data Explorer cluster outside of Splunk.

    *   **Impact:**
        Compromise of Azure AD Application Client Secret. An attacker can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster. This could lead to:
            *   Data breaches: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data stored in Azure Data Explorer.
            *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the Azure Data Explorer cluster.
            *   Denial of service: Disrupting the normal operation of the Azure Data Explorer cluster.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The project relies on Splunk's default configuration storage, which may not be secure enough for sensitive credentials without additional hardening and best practices followed by Splunk administrators.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement secure storage of the Application Client Secret using Splunk's Credential Vault. This would encrypt the secret and restrict access to authorized Splunk processes.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege Documentation:** Provide clear documentation advising users to grant the Azure AD Application only the minimum necessary permissions required for data ingestion into Azure Data Explorer.
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement Documentation:** Explicitly mention and recommend ensuring HTTPS is used for all communication between Splunk and Azure Data Explorer to mitigate potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks during initial configuration or updates of credentials.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Splunk server's filesystem or Splunk Web UI with administrative privileges.
        *   The Splunk Addon for Azure Data Explorer has been configured with Azure AD Application credentials.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/send_to_adx.py` and `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/modalert_send_to_adx_helper.py`, the parameters `app_id` and `app_secret` are retrieved using `helper.get_param()`. This indicates that these parameters are read from the Splunk configuration.
        2.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/adx_connector.py`, these retrieved `app_id` and `app_secret` values are directly used to construct the `KustoConnectionStringBuilder` using `KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(self.ingest_URL, self.app_id, self.app_secret, self.tenant_id)`.
        3.  No code within the provided files demonstrates the use of Splunk's Credential Vault or any other secure method for handling the Application Client Secret. The application relies on Splunk's configuration management for storing these sensitive credentials.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Install the Splunk Addon for Azure Data Explorer on a Splunk instance.
        2.  Configure the addon through the Splunk UI by providing valid Azure AD Application Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID, along with other necessary Azure Data Explorer connection parameters.
        3.  Access the Splunk server's configuration files for the addon. These files are typically located within the Splunk app directory (e.g., `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<addon_name>/`).  Specific configuration files to examine may include `alert_actions.conf` or any custom configuration files used by the addon.
        4.  Open the configuration files and search for the parameter name corresponding to the Application Client Secret (e.g., `app_secret`).
        5.  Observe how the Application Client Secret is stored. Verify if it is stored in plaintext or in a format that appears to be easily reversible (e.g., base64 encoded without encryption).
        6.  If the secret is exposed in plaintext or a reversibly encoded format, manually use the extracted Application Client Secret, along with the Application Client ID and Tenant ID, to attempt to authenticate to the configured Azure Data Explorer cluster using a tool like `kusto-cli` or the Azure Data Explorer Python SDK from an external machine, completely bypassing Splunk.
        7.  If successful authentication is achieved, it confirms the vulnerability of insecure credential storage.

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Data Exfiltration via Misconfigured Azure Data Explorer Cluster URL

    *   **Description:**
        1.  During the Splunk Addon configuration for Azure Data Explorer, the user is prompted to enter the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL".
        2.  An attacker could mislead or socially engineer a Splunk user with administrative privileges into entering a malicious "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" pointing to an attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. This could be achieved through various means, such as phishing, compromised documentation, or by exploiting user error.
        3.  The user, unknowingly or intentionally tricked, configures the Splunk Addon with the attacker's malicious Azure Data Explorer Cluster URL.
        4.  When Splunk alerts trigger the "Send to Azure Data Explorer" alert action, the addon, using the misconfigured URL, sends the alert data to the attacker's Azure Data Explorer instance instead of the legitimate, intended Azure Data Explorer cluster.
        5.  The attacker gains access to all data exported from Splunk through this misconfiguration.

    *   **Impact:**
        Complete data exfiltration. All data intended to be sent to the legitimate Azure Data Explorer cluster is redirected to an attacker-controlled instance. This results in a full data breach, as the attacker gains unauthorized access to potentially sensitive logs and data originating from the Splunk environment.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The project code directly uses the provided "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" without any validation or mechanism to prevent redirection to an unintended or malicious endpoint.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While fully validating the "Cluster Ingestion URL" might be complex and restrictive, basic input sanitization and warnings about verifying the URL could be implemented.
        *   **Configuration Verification Documentation:** Emphasize in the documentation and configuration steps the critical importance of carefully verifying the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" to ensure it points to the correct and legitimate Azure Data Explorer cluster. Highlight the risks of data exfiltration if misconfigured.
        *   **Consider Restricting Allowed Clusters (Optional and with caveats):**  In specific, highly controlled environments, consider a feature to pre-configure or restrict the allowed "Azure Cluster Ingestion URLs" to a predefined whitelist. However, this approach reduces flexibility and might not be suitable for all use cases. If implemented, it should be optional and carefully documented, noting the trade-offs.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   An attacker can successfully trick or socially engineer a Splunk user with administrative privileges into misconfiguring the Splunk Addon.
        *   The user must be in the process of configuring or reconfiguring the Azure Data Explorer connection settings within the Splunk Addon.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/send_to_adx.py` and `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/modalert_send_to_adx_helper.py`, the `cluster_url` parameter is retrieved using `helper.get_param()`. This indicates it's read directly from the user-provided Splunk configuration.
        2.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/adx_connector.py`, this retrieved `cluster_url` is used without any validation or modification to create the `KustoConnectionStringBuilder`: `KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(self.ingest_URL, self.app_id, self.app_secret, self.tenant_id)`.  The `self.ingest_URL` here is directly assigned the value of the `cluster_url` configuration parameter.
        3.  There is no code present in the provided files that performs any validation, sanitization, or verification of the `cluster_url` to ensure it is a legitimate and intended Azure Data Explorer endpoint.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Set up a Splunk instance and install the Azure Data Explorer Splunk Addon.
        2.  Prepare an attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. This instance should be set up to receive and store ingested data, allowing verification of successful data redirection.
        3.  Configure the Splunk Addon's alert action. During configuration, in the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" field, intentionally enter the ingestion URL of the attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. Use dummy or non-sensitive values for other configuration parameters like Azure AD Application credentials if needed to proceed with the configuration process (though valid application credentials for the attacker-controlled instance could also be used for a more realistic test).
        4.  Create or modify a Splunk alert to use the "Send to Azure Data Explorer" alert action configured in the previous step.
        5.  Trigger the Splunk alert. This should initiate the data export process using the misconfigured addon.
        6.  Access and examine the attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. Verify if the data from the triggered Splunk alert has been successfully ingested into the attacker's ADX instance.
        7.  If the alert data is found in the attacker's Azure Data Explorer instance, it confirms the vulnerability, demonstrating successful data exfiltration due to a misconfigured Cluster URL.
