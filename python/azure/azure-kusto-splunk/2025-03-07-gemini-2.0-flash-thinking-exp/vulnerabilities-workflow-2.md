### Insecure Storage of Azure Data Explorer Application Client Secret in Splunk Configuration Files

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Azure Data Explorer Application Client Secret in Splunk Configuration Files

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The Splunk Add-on for Azure Data Explorer requires users to configure connection details, including the Azure Application Client Secret, through the Splunk UI when setting up an alert action.
        2.  This client secret is stored in plain text or a reversible format within Splunk's configuration files (e.g., `alert_actions.conf`, potentially within the app's directory in Splunk's file system).
        3.  An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Splunk server's file system or Splunk's configuration management interface can retrieve this client secret.
        4.  Access to Splunk configuration files can be achieved through various means, including:
            - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Splunk platform.
            - Compromising Splunk administrator accounts with insufficient security practices (weak passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication).
            - Gaining unauthorized access to the underlying server infrastructure where Splunk is installed.
            - Insider threats.
        5.  Once the attacker retrieves the Azure Application Client Secret, they can use it to authenticate against the configured Azure Data Explorer cluster.

    *   **Impact:**
        - **Unauthorized Access to Azure Data Explorer Cluster:** An attacker can gain full access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster, potentially leading to:
            - **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data stored in Azure Data Explorer.
            - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the Azure Data Explorer cluster, compromising data integrity.
            - **Resource Abuse:** Using the compromised credentials to ingest malicious data, perform expensive queries, or otherwise abuse Azure Data Explorer resources, potentially leading to increased costs or denial of service.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The provided project files and documentation do not include any explicit mitigations for secure storage of the client secret. The README files guide users to directly input the client secret into the Splunk Add-on configuration.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for the client secret within the Splunk Add-on. Splunk provides a Credential Store that can be used to securely store and manage sensitive credentials. The add-on should be modified to utilize the Splunk Credential Store instead of storing the secret in plain text in configuration files.
        - **Secret Masking in UI and Logs:** Splunk should provide UI features to mask the display of the client secret after it is entered. Additionally, ensure that the client secret is never logged in plain text in Splunk logs.
        - **Principle of Least Privilege Documentation:** Documentation should strongly emphasize the principle of least privilege for Splunk users and administrators who manage the add-on. Access to Splunk configuration files and the Splunk server itself should be restricted to only authorized personnel.
        - **Security Hardening Guidance:** Provide comprehensive security hardening guidance for Splunk instances used with this add-on, including recommendations for access control, file system permissions, regular security audits, and use of multi-factor authentication for Splunk administrators.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - The Splunk Add-on for Azure Data Explorer is installed and configured with Azure Data Explorer connection details, including the Application Client Secret.
        - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Splunk server's file system or Splunk's configuration management interface.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        - **File: `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/README.md` and `/code/README.md`**: These README files, which serve as user documentation, explicitly instruct users to configure the "Azure Application Client secret" in Step 3: Configure Splunk Addon for Azure Data Explorer. Screenshots in `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/README.md` visually confirm that the client secret is entered as a plain text value in a configuration field within the Splunk UI when setting up the alert action.
        - **File: `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/send_to_adx.py` and `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/modalert_send_to_adx_helper.py`**: These Python files are part of the Splunk Add-on's alert action. They retrieve the `app_secret` parameter using `helper.get_param('app_secret')`. This confirms that the client secret, configured through the Splunk UI, is accessed by the add-on's code.
        - ```python
          # File: /code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/modalert_send_to_adx_helper.py
          def process_event(helper, *args, **kwargs):
              # ...
              app_secret = helper.get_param('app_secret')
              # ...
          ```
        - The `helper.get_param('app_secret')` function, part of the Splunk Modular Alert framework, retrieves the parameter value directly from the Splunk configuration. There is no code in these files or elsewhere in the provided project that suggests any secure handling or storage of this secret. It is treated as a regular configuration parameter and passed directly to the `ADXSplunkConnector` class.
        - **File: `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/adx_connector.py`**: This file initializes the `ADXSplunkConnector` class, taking `app_secret` as a constructor parameter and using it to build the Kusto connection string.
        - ```python
          # File: /code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/adx_connector.py
          class ADXSplunkConnector:
              def __init__(self, ingest_URL, app_id, app_secret, tenant_id, database_name, table_name, table_mapping_name, durable_mode, session_identifier):
                  # ...
                  self.app_secret = app_secret
                  # ...
                  kcsb = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(self.ingest_URL, self.app_id, self.app_secret, self.tenant_id)
                  # ...
          ```
        - The code directly uses the `app_secret` to authenticate with Azure Data Explorer, without any intermediate secure storage or handling within the add-on itself. The vulnerability stems from Splunk's configuration storage mechanism and the add-on's reliance on it for sensitive credentials.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Prerequisites:**
            - Install a Splunk instance (e.g., Splunk Enterprise Trial).
            - Install the Splunk Add-on for Azure Data Explorer on the Splunk instance.
            - Configure an alert in Splunk that uses the "Send to Azure Data Explorer" alert action.
            - During the alert action configuration, provide valid Azure Data Explorer connection details, including a **test** Azure Application Client Secret (ensure this secret is for a test ADX cluster and limited permissions to minimize risk during testing).
        2.  **Access Splunk Configuration Files:**
            - Locate the Splunk app directory for the Azure Data Explorer Add-on. The typical location is within `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-splunkadx-alert/`.
            - Navigate to the `default` or `local` directory within the app directory (configuration precedence rules in Splunk apply).
            - Identify the configuration file related to alert actions. This is often `alert_actions.conf` or a similar file within the app's configuration.
        3.  **Examine Configuration File Content:**
            - Open the relevant configuration file (e.g., `alert_actions.conf`) and examine its contents.
            - Search for the configuration stanza related to the "send_to_adx" alert action.
            - Look for the `app_secret` parameter within this stanza.
        4.  **Verify Plain Text Secret Storage:**
            - Observe that the `app_secret` value is stored in plain text or a trivially encoded format within the configuration file. It should be directly readable or easily decoded without specialized tools.
        5.  **Attempt Authentication with Retrieved Secret:**
            - Copy the retrieved `app_secret` value.
            - Using a separate tool or script (e.g., Kusto Python SDK, Azure CLI with Kusto extension), attempt to authenticate against the Azure Data Explorer cluster using the retrieved `app_secret`, along with the corresponding `app_id` and `tenant_id` (which are also configured in Splunk and likely retrievable).
            - If authentication is successful and you can access the Azure Data Explorer cluster using the retrieved secret, the vulnerability is confirmed.
        6.  **Cleanup (Important):**
            - After testing, immediately rotate or revoke the test Azure Application Client Secret to prevent any potential misuse.
            - Securely delete any configuration files or logs that may contain the client secret from your testing environment.

### Data Exfiltration via Misconfigured Azure Data Explorer Cluster URL

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Data Exfiltration via Misconfigured Azure Data Explorer Cluster URL

    *   **Description:**
        1.  During the Splunk Addon configuration for Azure Data Explorer, the user is prompted to enter the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL".
        2.  An attacker could mislead or socially engineer a Splunk user with administrative privileges into entering a malicious "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" pointing to an attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. This could be achieved through various means, such as phishing, compromised documentation, or by exploiting user error.
        3.  The user, unknowingly or intentionally tricked, configures the Splunk Addon with the attacker's malicious Azure Data Explorer Cluster URL.
        4.  When Splunk alerts trigger the "Send to Azure Data Explorer" alert action, the addon, using the misconfigured URL, sends the alert data to the attacker's Azure Data Explorer instance instead of the legitimate, intended Azure Data Explorer cluster.
        5.  The attacker gains access to all data exported from Splunk through this misconfiguration.

    *   **Impact:**
        Complete data exfiltration. All data intended to be sent to the legitimate Azure Data Explorer cluster is redirected to an attacker-controlled instance. This results in a full data breach, as the attacker gains unauthorized access to potentially sensitive logs and data originating from the Splunk environment.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The project code directly uses the provided "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" without any validation or mechanism to prevent redirection to an unintended or malicious endpoint.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While fully validating the "Cluster Ingestion URL" might be complex and restrictive, basic input sanitization and warnings about verifying the URL could be implemented.
        *   **Configuration Verification Documentation:** Emphasize in the documentation and configuration steps the critical importance of carefully verifying the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" to ensure it points to the correct and legitimate Azure Data Explorer cluster. Highlight the risks of data exfiltration if misconfigured.
        *   **Consider Restricting Allowed Clusters (Optional and with caveats):**  In specific, highly controlled environments, consider a feature to pre-configure or restrict the allowed "Azure Cluster Ingestion URLs" to a predefined whitelist. However, this approach reduces flexibility and might not be suitable for all use cases. If implemented, it should be optional and carefully documented, noting the trade-offs.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   An attacker can successfully trick or socially engineer a Splunk user with administrative privileges into misconfiguring the Splunk Addon.
        *   The user must be in the process of configuring or reconfiguring the Azure Data Explorer connection settings within the Splunk Addon.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/send_to_adx.py` and `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/modalert_send_to_adx_helper.py`, the `cluster_url` parameter is retrieved using `helper.get_param()`. This indicates it's read directly from the user-provided Splunk configuration.
        2.  In `/code/splunk-adx-alert-addon/adx_connector.py`, this retrieved `cluster_url` is used without any validation or modification to create the `KustoConnectionStringBuilder`: `KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(self.ingest_URL, self.app_id, self.app_secret, self.tenant_id)`.  The `self.ingest_URL` here is directly assigned the value of the `cluster_url` configuration parameter.
        3.  There is no code present in the provided files that performs any validation, sanitization, or verification of the `cluster_url` to ensure it is a legitimate and intended Azure Data Explorer endpoint.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Set up a Splunk instance and install the Azure Data Explorer Splunk Addon.
        2.  Prepare an attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. This instance should be set up to receive and store ingested data, allowing verification of successful data redirection.
        3.  Configure the Splunk Addon's alert action. During configuration, in the "Azure Cluster Ingestion URL" field, intentionally enter the ingestion URL of the attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. Use dummy or non-sensitive values for other configuration parameters like Azure AD Application credentials if needed to proceed with the configuration process (though valid application credentials for the attacker-controlled instance could also be used for a more realistic test).
        4.  Create or modify a Splunk alert to use the "Send to Azure Data Explorer" alert action configured in the previous step.
        5.  Trigger the Splunk alert. This should initiate the data export process using the misconfigured addon.
        6.  Access and examine the attacker-controlled Azure Data Explorer instance. Verify if the data from the triggered Splunk alert has been successfully ingested into the attacker's ADX instance.
        7.  If the alert data is found in the attacker's Azure Data Explorer instance, it confirms the vulnerability, demonstrating successful data exfiltration due to a misconfigured Cluster URL.

### Insecure Storage of Azure Data Explorer Credentials in SplunkADXForwarder

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Azure Data Explorer Credentials

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The application stores Azure Data Explorer credentials, specifically the `client_secret`, in plaintext within the `config.yml` configuration file.
        2.  An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where the `config.yml` file is located. This could be achieved through various methods, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system, insider threats, or misconfiguration of access controls on the server or container where the application is deployed.
        3.  The attacker reads the `config.yml` file.
        4.  The attacker extracts the plaintext `client_secret` from the `config.yml` file.
        5.  Using the obtained `client_secret`, along with other parameters like `client_id`, `tenant_id`, and `ingest_url` which are also available in the same `config.yml`, the attacker can successfully authenticate to the targeted Azure Data Explorer cluster.
        6.  Once authenticated, the attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the Azure Data Explorer cluster. The extent of these actions depends on the permissions associated with the compromised credentials, potentially including reading sensitive data, modifying or deleting critical information, or disrupting the service.

    *   **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to unauthorized access to the Azure Data Explorer cluster. This can result in severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, and service disruption, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised credentials.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The application stores the `client_secret` in plaintext directly within the `config.yml` file. There are no mechanisms in place to encrypt or securely store these sensitive credentials.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Implement secure credential storage: The application should utilize secure methods for storing sensitive credentials instead of plaintext configuration files. Options include:
            - Using a dedicated secrets management service like Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve credentials.
            - Employing environment variables to inject credentials at runtime, avoiding storage in configuration files.
            - Encrypting the `config.yml` file or specific credential values within it using robust encryption algorithms and securely managing the encryption keys.
        - Implement file system access controls: Restrict access to the `config.yml` file and the application's deployment environment to only authorized users and processes. This can be achieved through proper file permissions in the operating system or container environment. Regularly review and enforce these access controls.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - The `SplunkADXForwarder` application must be deployed and configured to use Azure Data Explorer, with the Azure Data Explorer credentials (including `client_secret`) configured in the `config.yml` file.
        - An attacker must be able to gain unauthorized access to the file system where the `config.yml` file is stored. This could be the server where the application is running, a container image, or a shared storage volume.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/SplunkADXForwarder/config.yml`
            ```yaml
            client_secret : client_secret
            ```
            This configuration file explicitly defines the `client_secret` parameter and, as shown in the example, stores it in plaintext.  There is no indication of encryption or secure handling of this sensitive value within this file.
        - File: `/code/SplunkADXForwarder/app.py`
            ```python
            with open("config.yml", "r") as config_file:
                config = yaml.safe_load(config_file)

            client_secret = config['client_secret']

            kcsb = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(cluster, client_id, client_secret, authority)
            ```
            This code snippet demonstrates how the application reads the `config.yml` file, loads the configuration, and retrieves the `client_secret` directly from the configuration. Subsequently, this plaintext `client_secret` is used to construct the `KustoConnectionStringBuilder` for authenticating with Azure Data Explorer. This confirms that the application directly utilizes the plaintext secret from the configuration file for authentication, without any secure handling or retrieval mechanisms.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1. Deploy the `SplunkADXForwarder` application. For example, use Docker to build and run the application:
            ```bash
            cd /code/SplunkADXForwarder/
            docker build -t splunk-adx-forwarder .
            docker run -d --name splunk-adx-forwarder-instance splunk-adx-forwarder
            ```
        2. Access the running container's shell. This allows you to simulate an attacker gaining access to the application's environment:
            ```bash
            docker exec -it splunk-adx-forwarder-instance /bin/bash
            ```
        3. Navigate to the application's configuration directory within the container:
            ```bash
            cd /app
            ```
        4. Read the contents of the `config.yml` file to expose the stored credentials:
            ```bash
            cat config.yml
            ```
        5. Observe the output and confirm that the `client_secret` is visible in plaintext within the `config.yml` file. Note down the values for `ingest_url`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `authority`, `database_name`.
        6. Exit the container shell:
            ```bash
            exit
            ```
        7. Using a Kusto client (like Kusto Explorer or the `kustoctl` CLI tool) from your local machine or a different secure environment, attempt to connect to the Azure Data Explorer cluster using the extracted credentials. Construct the connection string using the `ingest_url`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `authority` obtained from `config.yml`.
        8. If the connection to the Azure Data Explorer cluster is successful using these credentials, it validates the vulnerability. This confirms that an attacker who gains access to the `config.yml` file can successfully extract and use the plaintext credentials to access the Azure Data Explorer cluster without authorization.
