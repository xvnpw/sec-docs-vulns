### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Improper Input Validation in Default Resources Configuration
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON configuration file, specifically targeting the `default_resources` section.
    2. Within this section, the attacker injects a malicious payload into the `value` field of a resource definition. This field is intended to accept simple expressions like `node.vcpu_count` or `size::20g`.
    3. The autoscaling library, when processing this configuration file, uses `json_load` (or `load_config`) from `hpc.autoscale.util`, which itself uses `json.load` for parsing. While `json.load` is safe from direct code execution during parsing, the library proceeds to interpret the `value` strings as Python expressions.
    4. The `demandcalculator` and `NodeManager` components of the library then evaluate these `value` expressions, including the attacker's malicious payload, using `eval()` or similar mechanisms without proper sanitization or sandboxing.
    5. This evaluation can lead to arbitrary Python code execution within the context of the autoscaling application, potentially compromising the Azure CycleCloud environment.
* Impact:
    - **High to Critical**: If successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the system running the autoscaling library. This can lead to:
        - **Unauthorized Resource Manipulation**: The attacker could leverage the CycleCloud REST API credentials available to the autoscaling library to modify cluster configurations, start or stop nodes, delete resources, or perform other administrative actions within the Azure CycleCloud environment.
        - **Information Disclosure**: The attacker could access sensitive information, including credentials, configuration details, and data within the Azure environment accessible to the CycleCloud installation.
        - **Lateral Movement**: In a more complex scenario, the attacker could potentially use the compromised system as a stepping stone to pivot to other resources within the Azure environment or the wider network.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly evaluates the `value` fields as Python expressions without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation**: The library must implement strict input validation for the `value` fields in the `default_resources` configuration. This should include:
        - **Restricting Allowed Characters**: Limit the characters allowed in `value` fields to a safe subset, excluding potentially harmful characters that could be used in code injection attacks.
        - **Using a Safe Expression Evaluator**: Replace direct `eval()` or similar functions with a safe expression evaluation library that does not allow arbitrary code execution. Consider using a parser and evaluator that only supports a predefined set of safe functions and operators relevant to resource calculations.
        - **Schema Validation**: Implement a JSON schema to enforce the structure and data types of the configuration file, preventing unexpected or malicious inputs from being processed.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `autoscale.json` configuration file to the autoscaling library. This could happen if:
        - The autoscaling library reads the configuration from a location that is writable by the attacker (unlikely in typical deployments, but possible in misconfigurations).
        - The autoscaling library is part of a larger system where other vulnerabilities allow an attacker to modify the configuration file.
        - A user with access to modify the configuration file is tricked into using a malicious configuration.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/example-celery/specs/broker/cluster-init/scripts/01.install.packages.sh`
    - Line: `python -m hpc.autoscale.cli initconfig ... --default-resource '{"select": {}, "name": "ncpus", "value": "node.vcpu_count"}' ... > $INSTALLDIR/autoscale.json`
    - This script initializes the `autoscale.json` configuration file. The `--default-resource` argument takes a JSON string where the `value` is set to `"node.vcpu_count"`. This is an example of the intended usage of the `value` field as a Python expression.
    - File: `/code/src/hpc/autoscale/job/demandcalculator.py`
    - Function: `_add_job` and related functions that use `default_resources` from config.
    - The code within `DemandCalculator` and `NodeManager` utilizes the configurations loaded from `autoscale.json`, including `default_resources`. The `value` strings within `default_resources` are treated as Python expressions and evaluated in runtime. This is where the vulnerability lies, as there is no sanitization of these `value` strings before evaluation.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        User-Provided autoscale.json --> json_load (util.py) --> Configuration (Dict) --> DemandCalculator/NodeManager --> default_resources (from config) --> value (string from JSON) --> eval() or similar --> Code Execution
        ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Deploy the `cyclecloud-scalelib` library in a test environment as described in the README. This assumes you have access to an Azure CycleCloud installation and can set up the Celery example.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Configuration**: Create a modified `autoscale.json` file. In the `default_resources` section, inject a malicious Python payload into the `value` field. For example, modify the default `ncpus` resource definition to:
    ```json
    {
       "select": {},
       "name": "ncpus",
       "value": "__import__('os').system('touch /tmp/pwned')"
    }
    ```
    This payload attempts to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory on the system where the autoscaler runs. A more sophisticated attack could involve reverse shells or data exfiltration.
    3. **Replace Configuration File**: Replace the original `autoscale.json` file in the deployment with the malicious `autoscale.json` created in step 2.
    4. **Trigger Autoscaling**: Run the autoscaling script (e.g., `autoscale.py` from the Celery example). This will cause the library to load and process the malicious configuration.
    5. **Verify Code Execution**: Check if the `/tmp/pwned` file exists on the system. If it does, this confirms that the injected Python code was executed successfully, demonstrating the vulnerability. For more complex payloads, monitor system logs or network traffic for signs of successful exploitation (e.g., reverse shell connection, data exfiltration attempts).
