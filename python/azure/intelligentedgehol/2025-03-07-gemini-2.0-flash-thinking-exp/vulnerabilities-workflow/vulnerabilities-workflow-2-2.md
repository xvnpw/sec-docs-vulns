### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Static File Serving

- Description:
  1. The YoloModule exposes a web server using Tornado to serve static files from the `/code/modules/YoloModule/app/templates` directory.
  2. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) to access files and directories outside of the intended static file directory.
  3. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web server, an attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the Jetson Nano device, such as configuration files, system files, or other module code.
  4. For example, an attacker might try to access `/../../../../../etc/passwd` to read the system's password file or `/../../../../../code/modules/YoloModule/app/main.py` to read the module's source code.

- Impact:
  - **Information Disclosure:** Successful path traversal can allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the Jetson Nano device, potentially exposing confidential information, credentials, or source code.
  - **Privilege Escalation (potential):** If sensitive files like configuration files or scripts with elevated privileges are exposed, it might lead to further exploitation and privilege escalation.
  - **Loss of Confidentiality:** Access to sensitive data can lead to a loss of confidentiality and compromise the security of the IoT Edge device and potentially the entire IoT solution.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The project uses Tornado's `StaticFileHandler` without any explicit security configurations to prevent path traversal. While `StaticFileHandler` has default protections, they might be insufficient or bypassed.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal sequences in requested file paths.
  - **Restrict Static File Directory:** Ensure that the static file serving directory is strictly limited to the intended files and does not include any sensitive directories or files.
  - **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a Web Application Firewall to detect and block path traversal attempts and other web-based attacks.
  - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including path traversal.

- Preconditions:
  - The YoloModule must be deployed and running on a Jetson Nano device.
  - The web server exposed by the YoloModule on port 80 (or configured port) must be accessible to the attacker.
  - The attacker needs to know or guess the IP address or hostname of the Jetson Nano device.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/modules/YoloModule/app/ImageServer.py`
  ```python
  indexPath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'templates')
  app = tornado.web.Application([
      (r"/stream", ImageStreamHandler, {'videoCapture': self.videoCapture}),
      (r"/(.*)", tornado.web.StaticFileHandler, {'path': indexPath, 'default_filename': 'index.html'})
  ])
  ```
  - The `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler` is configured to serve files from the `indexPath`, which is set to the `templates` directory relative to the `ImageServer.py` file.
  - The path pattern `r"/(.*)"` captures any path after the base URL and passes it to the `StaticFileHandler`.
  - **Vulnerability:** If Tornado's `StaticFileHandler` or the underlying operating system's file path handling has any weaknesses, an attacker might be able to use path traversal sequences within the `(.*)` path to access files outside of the `/code/modules/YoloModule/app/templates` directory.
  - While Tornado's `StaticFileHandler` is designed to prevent basic path traversal, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can still occur. Deeper analysis of Tornado's path handling and security best practices for `StaticFileHandler` is needed to confirm the presence and severity of this vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Deploy the YoloModule to a Jetson Nano device and ensure the web server is running and accessible on its IP address (e.g., `http://<jetson-nano-ip>`).
  2. Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or `wget`.
  3. Craft a URL to attempt path traversal, for example: `http://<jetson-nano-ip>/../../../../../etc/passwd`.
  4. Send the crafted URL to the web server.
  5. **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** If the server responds with the content of the `/etc/passwd` file, it indicates a successful path traversal vulnerability.
  6. **Expected Mitigated Behavior:** If the server responds with a 404 Not Found error or any other error indicating that the file is not accessible, it suggests that path traversal is either mitigated by Tornado or the file does not exist at the traversed path (less likely for `/etc/passwd`).
  7. Repeat steps 3-6 with other sensitive file paths, such as:
     - `http://<jetson-nano-ip>/../../../../../code/modules/YoloModule/app/main.py` (to access module source code)
     - `http://<jetson-nano-ip>/../../../../../var/log/syslog` (to access system logs)
  8. Analyze the server responses for each crafted URL to confirm if path traversal is possible and what files can be accessed.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive files from the device. Further investigation and testing are needed to fully assess the risk and confirm exploitability.
