### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Command Injection in VideoSource (YouTube URL)
* Description:
    1. The application receives updates to its module twin, which can include a `VideoSource` parameter specifying the video stream source.
    2. When the `VideoSource` is identified as a YouTube URL, the application attempts to download the video using `youtube-dl` via `os.system`.
    3. The provided YouTube URL from the `VideoSource` parameter is directly passed to the `os.system` command without proper sanitization.
    4. A malicious actor can craft a YouTube URL that includes shell commands, for example, by embedding backticks or other command injection sequences.
    5. When the application processes this malicious URL, the injected commands will be executed by `os.system` on the Jetson Nano device.

* Impact:
    * **Critical**. Successful command injection allows arbitrary command execution on the underlying Jetson Nano device.
    * An attacker can gain full control of the device.
    * Potential impacts include: data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service, and using the device as part of a botnet.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The application directly uses `os.system` with unsanitized input from the `VideoSource` parameter.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for the `VideoSource` parameter, especially when handling YouTube URLs. Validate the URL format and reject or sanitize any potentially malicious characters or command injection sequences.
    * **Avoid `os.system`:** Replace the usage of `os.system` for executing external commands like `youtube-dl`. Use safer alternatives such as the `subprocess` module with careful argument handling to prevent shell injection. Ideally, use a dedicated Python library for YouTube downloading that does not rely on shell commands, if available and suitable.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

* Preconditions:
    * The attacker must be able to modify the `VideoSource` property in the YoloModule's module twin.
    * This could be achieved through compromised Azure IoT Hub credentials, a malicious insider with access to the IoT Hub, or potentially through other vulnerabilities in the IoT Edge deployment that could allow module twin modification.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`/code/modules/YoloModule/app/main.py` - `device_twin_callback` function:**
        ```python
        def device_twin_callback(update_state, payload, user_context):
            # ...
            if "VideoSource" in jsonData:
                strUrl = str(jsonData['VideoSource'])
                print("   - VideoSource     : " + strUrl)
                if strUrl.lower() != videoCapture.videoPath.lower() and strUrl != "":
                    videoCapture.setVideoSource(strUrl)
            # ...
        ```
        This function retrieves the `VideoSource` from the module twin payload and passes it directly to `videoCapture.setVideoSource()`.

    2. **`/code/modules/YoloModule/app/VideoCapture.py` - `setVideoSource` function:**
        ```python
        def setVideoSource(self, newVideoPath):
            # ...
            elif self.__IsYoutube(newVideoPath):
                print("\r\n===> YouTube Video Source")
                self.useStream = False
                self.useMovieFile = True
                # This is video file
                self.downloadVideo(newVideoPath) # Calls downloadVideo with unsanitized input
                self.videoPath = newVideoPath
                # ...
        ```
        This function identifies YouTube URLs and calls `self.downloadVideo()` with the unsanitized `newVideoPath`.

    3. **`/code/modules/YoloModule/app/VideoCapture.py` - `downloadVideo` function:**
        ```python
        def downloadVideo(self, videoUrl):
            # ...
            print("Start downloading video")
            os.system("youtube-dl -o /app/video.mp4 -f mp4 " + videoUrl) # Command injection vulnerability
            print("Download Complete")
            self.vCapture = cv2.VideoCapture("/app/video.mp4")
            # ...
        ```
        This function directly uses `os.system` to execute `youtube-dl` with the `videoUrl` parameter, creating the command injection vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure the YoloModule is deployed and running on a Jetson Nano device connected to Azure IoT Hub. You need access to modify the module twin properties, for example, using Azure IoT Explorer or Azure CLI.
    2. **Identify Target Module Twin:** In Azure IoT Explorer or a similar tool, locate the device and the `YoloModule` module twin.
    3. **Modify `VideoSource` Property:** Navigate to the "properties" -> "desired" section of the `YoloModule` twin. Modify the `VideoSource` property to the following malicious YouTube URL:
        ```
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyz`touch /tmp/pwned`"
        ```
        (Note: Replace `xyz` with any valid YouTube video ID to maintain URL validity for basic checks by `youtube-dl` itself, the backticks are for command injection).
    4. **Update Module Twin:** Apply the changes to the module twin by clicking "Update" or the equivalent action in your tool.
    5. **Execute Command on Jetson Nano:** Access the Jetson Nano device via SSH or serial console.
    6. **Verify Command Execution:** Check if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` has been executed successfully. You can do this by listing the contents of the `/tmp` directory:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
        If a file named `pwned` exists in the `/tmp` directory, the command injection was successful. This confirms the vulnerability.
