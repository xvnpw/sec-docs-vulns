### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Module and Extension Creation

- Description:
    1. A malicious developer crafts a module or extension name containing command injection payloads.
    2. This malicious name is provided as input to the `azdev cli create <module-name>` or `azdev extension create <extension-name>` command.
    3. Within the `create_module` or `create_extension` functions in `/code/azdev/operations/code_gen.py`, the unsanitized module or extension name is used in string formatting to construct file paths, specifically when creating directories for the new module/extension.
    4. Although the code does not directly execute shell commands with the module/extension name, the formatted path is passed to `os.path.join` and `os.makedirs`.
    5. If the module/extension name is crafted to include path traversal characters and command substitution, while `os.makedirs` itself might not execute commands directly, the creation of directories with attacker-controlled names can lead to unexpected behavior or potentially be leveraged in more complex exploits if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

- Impact:
    - While direct arbitrary code execution through `os.makedirs` with crafted directory names is unlikely, an attacker can manipulate the file system structure within the development environment.
    - This could lead to:
        - **File system manipulation:** Creation of directories outside the intended module/extension directory.
        - **Path traversal:** Potential overwriting of existing files or directories if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
        - **Limited code execution (indirect):** In highly specific scenarios, if other parts of the `azdev` tool or the developer's environment rely on predictable file paths, a manipulated directory structure could potentially disrupt the tool's functionality or create unexpected side effects, which in turn could be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution. However, this is a highly theoretical and complex scenario.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the provided module/extension name without any sanitization or validation before using it in file path operations within `create_module` and `create_extension` functions in `/code/azdev/operations/code_gen.py`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize module and extension names to remove or escape any characters that could be used for path traversal or command injection before using them in file path operations.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate module and extension names against a strict whitelist of allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric and hyphens) to prevent unexpected characters from being used.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a developer to use a maliciously crafted module or extension name with the `azdev cli create` or `azdev extension create` command. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising a source of module/extension names used in development workflows.

        A[azdev cli create/extension create] --> B(get mod/ext name input)
        B --> C(create_module/create_extension in code_gen.py)

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up the `azdev` development environment as described in the README.
    2. Open a terminal and activate the `azdev` virtual environment.
    3. Run the following command to create a CLI module with a malicious name designed for command injection:
       ```bash
       azdev cli create "$(touch PWNED)"
       ```
       or for extension
       ```bash
       azdev extension create "$(touch PWNED)"
       ```
    4. Observe the output and file system.
    5. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** A file named `PWNED` is created in the current directory, indicating command injection.
    6. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The command fails to create the module/extension, or no file named `PWNED` is created in the current directory, indicating successful mitigation.

- Vulnerability Rank Justification:
    - Rank: Medium
    - Justification: While direct and immediate arbitrary code execution is not confirmed, the vulnerability allows for file system manipulation and path traversal, creating a potential stepping stone for more severe attacks, especially in development environments where developers might be running with elevated privileges or where the manipulated file structure can be further exploited. The risk is elevated because `azdev` is a developer tool, and compromised developer machines can have significant downstream impacts on software supply chains.
