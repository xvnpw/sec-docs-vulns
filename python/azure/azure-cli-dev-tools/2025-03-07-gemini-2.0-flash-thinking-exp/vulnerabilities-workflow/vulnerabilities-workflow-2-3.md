- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Module/Extension Creation
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious module or extension name containing shell commands.
    2. The attacker uses this malicious name as input to the `azdev cli create <module-name>` or `azdev extension create <extension-name>` command.
    3. The `azdev` tool, without proper sanitization, incorporates this malicious name into a shell command, specifically within the `_create_package` function in `/code/azdev/operations/code_gen.py`.
    4. This shell command, intended for installing the newly created module/extension using `pip install -e <path>`, is executed by the `azdev` tool.
    5. Due to the lack of input sanitization, the attacker's injected shell commands are executed on the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running `azdev`.
- Impact:
    - **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine. This can lead to:
        - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive files, credentials, or environment variables from the developer's machine.
        - **Malware Installation:** Installing malware, backdoors, or ransomware on the developer's system.
        - **Account Takeover:** If the developer's environment contains credentials for cloud accounts or other systems, the attacker could potentially gain access to these accounts.
        - **Supply Chain Attack:** Injected malicious code could be inadvertently included in development artifacts or shared with other developers.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any sanitization or validation of module/extension names against command injection attacks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the module or extension name input to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as shell commands. This should be done before incorporating the name into any shell command.
    - **Parameterized Commands:** Use parameterized commands or functions that avoid direct shell interpretation of user-provided strings. For example, when using `subprocess`, pass arguments as a list to prevent shell injection when possible.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for module and extension names, allowing only alphanumeric characters and specific symbols (like hyphens or underscores) and rejecting any input containing potentially dangerous characters (like backticks, semicolons, pipes, etc.).
- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to trick a developer into using the `azdev cli create` or `azdev extension create` command with a maliciously crafted module or extension name. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by hosting a malicious repository that suggests using `azdev` with a specific name.
    2. The developer must have `azdev` tool installed and execute the vulnerable command in their development environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/azdev/operations/code_gen.py`
    2. **Function:** `_create_package(prefix, repo_path, is_ext, name='test', ...)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        def _create_package(prefix, repo_path, is_ext, name='test', display_name=None, display_name_plural=None,
                            required_sdk=None, client_name=None, operation_name=None, sdk_property=None,
                            not_preview=False, local_sdk=None):
            ...
            package_name = '{}{}'.format(prefix, name.replace('_', '-')) if not is_ext else name
            new_package_path = os.path.join(repo_path, package_name)
            ...
            if is_ext:
                result = pip_cmd('install -e {}'.format(new_package_path), "Installing `{}{}`...".format(prefix, name)) # Potential command injection
                if result.error:
                    raise result.error
        ```
    4. **Explanation:**
        - The `_create_package` function constructs the path for the new module/extension using `os.path.join` and string formatting with the user-provided `name` (which becomes `package_name`).
        - This `new_package_path` is then directly embedded into the `pip install -e {}` command string passed to `pip_cmd`.
        - If the `name` variable, derived from user input, contains malicious shell commands, these commands could be executed during the `pip install` process.
    5. **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (module_name/extension_name) --> package_name (string formatting) --> new_package_path (os.path.join) -->
    "pip install -e " + new_package_path  --> pip_cmd (shell command execution) --> System Command Execution
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have a development environment with `azdev` installed.
        - Clone the `azure-cli-dev-tools` repository to have the `azdev` source code available.
        - Activate a virtual environment.
    2. **Craft Malicious Input:**
        - Create a malicious module name that includes a command injection payload. For example: `testmodule\`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`\``. This name attempts to create a directory named `testmodule``touch /tmp/pwned``` and then execute `touch /tmp/pwned`.
    3. **Execute Vulnerable Command:**
        - Run the `azdev cli create` command with the malicious module name:
          ```bash
          azdev cli create "testmodule\`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`\`"
          ```
    4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on your system.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, and arbitrary commands were executed.
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created, demonstrating successful command injection.
        - The `azdev cli create` command might fail or show errors after the command injection due to the invalid module name, but the injected command will have already been executed.
