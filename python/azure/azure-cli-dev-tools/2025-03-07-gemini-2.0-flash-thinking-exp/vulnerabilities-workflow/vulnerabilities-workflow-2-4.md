- Vulnerability name: Command Injection in `azdev cli create` and `azdev extension create`

- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious code into the `azdev cli create <module-name>` or `azdev extension create <extension-name>` commands by crafting a module or extension name that includes shell commands.
    2. When `azdev` processes this maliciously crafted name, it uses it in string concatenation to construct shell commands without proper sanitization.
    3. This allows the attacker's injected commands to be executed on the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running `azdev`.

- Impact:
    - An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
    - This could lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - No input sanitization or validation is implemented for module or extension names in the provided code.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for module and extension names to prevent command injection.
    - Use of parameterized commands or secure APIs instead of string concatenation for shell command execution.
    - Least privilege execution of `azdev` operations.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a developer to use `azdev cli create` or `azdev extension create` with a maliciously crafted module or extension name.
    - The developer must have `azdev` installed and execute the command in their terminal.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/azdev/operations/code_gen.py`
    2. Function: `create_module(mod_name='test', ...)` and `create_extension(ext_name='test', ...)` are responsible for creating new modules and extensions.
    3. Inside these functions, the `mod_name` and `ext_name` parameters, which are derived directly from user input, are used in constructing file paths and package names.
    4. For example, in `create_module`:
        ```python
        package_name = '{}{}'.format(prefix, name.replace('_', '-')) if not is_ext else name
        new_package_path = os.path.join(repo_path, package_name)
        ```
        and in `create_extension`:
        ```python
        package_name = '{}{}'.format(prefix, name.replace('_', '-')) if not is_ext else name
        new_package_path = os.path.join(repo_path, package_name)
        ```
    5. These `package_name` and `new_package_path` variables are then used in `pip_cmd` calls. For example, in `create_extension`:
        ```python
        result = pip_cmd('install -e {}'.format(new_package_path), "Installing `{}{}`...".format(prefix, name))
        ```
    6. The `pip_cmd` function (defined in `/code/azdev/utilities/command.py`) executes shell commands using `subprocess.run`.
    7. If a malicious user provides a `mod_name` or `ext_name` containing backticks or other shell injection characters, these could be interpreted by the shell when `pip_cmd` is executed, leading to command injection.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    UserInput (mod_name/ext_name) --> code_gen.py (create_module/create_extension) --> String Concatenation (package_name, new_package_path) --> pip_cmd --> subprocess.run (Shell Command Injection) --> System Command Execution
    ```

- Security test case:
    1. Open a terminal with `azdev` installed.
    2. Execute the following command to create a malicious CLI module:
    ```bash
    azdev cli create "$(touch /tmp/pwned_cli_module_creation_$(date +%s))"
    ```
    3. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_cli_module_creation_<timestamp>` was created. If the file exists, it indicates that the `touch` command injected through the module name was successfully executed.
    4. Execute the following command to create a malicious extension:
    ```bash
    azdev extension create "$(touch /tmp/pwned_extension_creation_$(date +%s))"
    ```
    5. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_extension_creation_<timestamp>` was created. If the file exists, it indicates that the `touch` command injected through the extension name was successfully executed.
