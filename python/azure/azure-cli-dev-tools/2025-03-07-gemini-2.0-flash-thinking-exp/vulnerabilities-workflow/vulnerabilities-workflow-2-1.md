### Vulnerability List for azdev Project

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious `--cli` Path in `azdev setup`
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious directory path or archive path containing a setup.py file with malicious code.
    2. The attacker tricks a developer into running the `azdev setup` command, providing the malicious path as the value for the `--cli` argument. For example: `azdev setup --cli "/tmp/malicious_cli_path"`.
    3. The `azdev setup` tool, within the `_install_cli` function in `/code/azdev/operations/setup.py`, uses the provided `--cli` path in a `pip install -e` command without proper sanitization.
    4. `pip install -e` executes the `setup.py` file found in the malicious path.
    5. The attacker's malicious code within the `setup.py` is executed on the developer's local machine.
* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. An attacker could gain full control of the developer's system, steal credentials, or modify source code.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided paths in shell commands without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `cli_path` argument in `azdev setup` to ensure it does not contain any malicious code or attempt to execute commands outside of intended operations. Validate that the path points to a legitimate Azure CLI repository or a safe directory.
    - **Path Validation:** Implement checks to validate that the provided path is a valid directory and potentially verify the contents of `setup.py` before executing pip install in editable mode.
    - **User Warning:** Display a clear warning message to the developer before executing `pip install -e` from a user-provided path, emphasizing the security risks and advising caution.
* Preconditions:
    - The developer must run the `azdev setup` command and be tricked into providing a malicious path for the `--cli` argument.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azdev/operations/setup.py`
    - Function: `_install_cli(cli_path, deps=None)`
    ```python
    def _install_cli(cli_path, deps=None):
        # ...
        if cli_path and cli_path != 'EDGE':
            # ...
            cli_src = os.path.join(cli_path, 'src')
            if deps == 'setup.py':
                # Resolve dependencies from setup.py files.
                # command modules have dependency on azure-cli-core so install this first
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {}".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-telemetry')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-telemetry`..."
                )
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {}".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-core')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-core`..."
                )

                # azure cli has dependencies on the above packages so install this one last
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {}".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli`..."
                )

                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {}".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-testsdk')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-testsdk`..."
                )
            else:
                # First install packages without dependencies,
                # then resolve dependencies from requirements.*.txt file.
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {} --no-deps".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-telemetry')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-telemetry`..."
                )
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {} --no-deps".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-core')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-core`..."
                )

                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {} --no-deps".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli`..."
                )

                # The dependencies of testsdk are not in requirements.txt as this package is not needed by the
                # azure-cli package for running commands.
                # Here we need to install with dependencies for azdev test.
                pip_cmd(
                    "install -e {}".format(os.path.join(cli_src, 'azure-cli-testsdk')), # Vulnerable code
                    "Installing `azure-cli-testsdk`..."
                )
                # ...
    ```
    - The code uses `pip_cmd("install -e {}".format(...))` which executes `pip install -e` with paths constructed using `cli_path` without any sanitization. This allows command injection if `cli_path` is malicious.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a directory named `malicious_cli_path` in `/tmp`.
    2. Inside `/tmp/malicious_cli_path`, create a directory structure `malicious_cli_path/src/azure-cli-telemetry`.
    3. Inside `/tmp/malicious_cli_path/src/azure-cli-telemetry`, create a file `setup.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='azure-cli-telemetry',
        version='0.1.0',
        packages=['azure_cli_telemetry'],
        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': [
                'malicious-command=azure_cli_telemetry:malicious_function',
            ],
        },
    )

    import os
    import sys

    def malicious_function():
        # Malicious payload to create a file in /tmp directory
        open('/tmp/pwned.txt', 'a').close()
        print("PWNED")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        malicious_function()
    ```
    4. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the `azdev` project.
    5. Run the command: `azdev setup --cli /tmp/malicious_cli_path`
    6. After the command completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists.
    7. If `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists, the vulnerability is confirmed. The "PWNED" message should also be printed to the console output during `azdev setup`.

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious `--repo` Path in `azdev setup`
* Description:
    - This vulnerability is similar to "Command Injection via Malicious `--cli` Path in `azdev setup`", but it affects the `--repo` argument.
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious directory path or archive path containing a setup.py file with malicious code.
    2. The attacker tricks a developer into running the `azdev setup` command, providing the malicious path as the value for the `--repo` argument. For example: `azdev setup --repo "/tmp/malicious_extension_repo"`.
    3. The `azdev setup` tool, within the `_install_extensions` function in `/code/azdev/operations/setup.py`, uses the provided `--repo` path in a `pip install -e` command without proper sanitization.
    4. `pip install -e` executes the `setup.py` file found in the malicious path.
    5. The attacker's malicious code within the `setup.py` is executed on the developer's local machine.
* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. An attacker could gain full control of the developer's system, steal credentials, or modify source code.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided paths in shell commands without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `ext_repo_path` argument in `azdev setup` to ensure it does not contain any malicious code or attempt to execute commands outside of intended operations. Validate that the path points to a legitimate Azure CLI extensions repository or a safe directory.
    - **Path Validation:** Implement checks to validate that the provided path is a valid directory and potentially verify the contents of `setup.py` before executing pip install in editable mode.
    - **User Warning:** Display a clear warning message to the developer before executing `pip install -e` from a user-provided path, emphasizing the security risks and advising caution.
* Preconditions:
    - The developer must run the `azdev setup` command and be tricked into providing a malicious path for the `--repo` argument.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azdev/operations/setup.py`
    - Function: `_install_extensions(ext_paths)`
    ```python
    def _install_extensions(ext_paths):
        # ...
        # install specified extensions
        for path in ext_paths or []:
            result = pip_cmd('install -e {}'.format(path), "Adding extension '{}'...".format(path)) # Vulnerable code
            if result.error:
                raise result.error  # pylint: disable=raising-bad-type
    ```
    - The code uses `pip_cmd("install -e {}".format(path))` which executes `pip install -e` with paths constructed using `ext_paths` without any sanitization. This allows command injection if `ext_paths` is malicious.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a directory named `malicious_extension_repo` in `/tmp`.
    2. Inside `/tmp/malicious_extension_repo`, create a file `setup.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='malicious-extension',
        version='0.1.0',
        packages=['malicious_extension'],
        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': [
                'malicious-ext-command=malicious_extension:malicious_function',
            ],
        },
    )

    import os
    import sys

    def malicious_function():
        # Malicious payload to create a file in /tmp directory
        open('/tmp/pwned_ext.txt', 'a').close()
        print("PWNED EXT")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        malicious_function()
    ```
    3. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the `azdev` project.
    4. Run the command: `azdev setup --repo /tmp/malicious_extension_repo`
    5. After the command completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned_ext.txt` exists.
    6. If `/tmp/pwned_ext.txt` exists, the vulnerability is confirmed. The "PWNED EXT" message should also be printed to the console output during `azdev setup`.
