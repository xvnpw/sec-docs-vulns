- vulnerability name: Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding in gRPC Extension

- description:
  - The gRPC extension for YOLOv3 and Tiny YOLOv3 uses OpenCV's `cv2.imdecode` function to decode image data received from the Azure Video Analyzer edge module.
  - An attacker can send a maliciously crafted video stream or specifically crafted image frames as input to the gRPC extension.
  - The `cv2.imdecode` function, if vulnerable to buffer overflows when processing malformed image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP), could lead to memory corruption.
  - By exploiting a buffer overflow in `cv2.imdecode`, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical memory regions.
  - This memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the IoT Edge device.
  - The vulnerability is triggered when the `ProcessMediaStream` function in `inference_engine.py` calls `GetCvImageFromRawBytes`, which in turn uses `cv2.imdecode`.

- impact:
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the IoT Edge device.
  - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the compromised IoT Edge device.
  - This can lead to data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks on the network the device is connected to.

- vulnerability rank: critical

- currently implemented mitigations:
  - None identified in the provided project files. The code relies on OpenCV's `cv2.imdecode` without any input validation or sanitization before decoding.

- missing mitigations:
  - Input validation: Implement validation checks on the incoming image data before passing it to `cv2.imdecode`. This could include:
    - File type validation: Check the magic bytes of the image to ensure it matches the expected format.
    - Image header parsing: Parse the image header to check for valid image dimensions and other parameters before decoding the entire image.
    - Size limits: Enforce maximum image dimensions and file sizes to prevent excessively large or complex images from being processed.
  - Secure decoding libraries: Consider using alternative image decoding libraries that are less prone to buffer overflow vulnerabilities or are regularly patched for security issues.
  - Sandboxing: Run the gRPC extension in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
  - Memory safety checks: Utilize compiler and runtime memory safety checks to detect and prevent buffer overflows.

- preconditions:
  - The attacker must be able to send video streams or image frames to the Azure Video Analyzer edge module.
  - The live pipeline must be configured to use the gRPC extension with YOLOv3 or Tiny YOLOv3.
  - The IoT Edge device must be running the vulnerable gRPC extension module.

- source code analysis:
  - File: `/code/edge-modules/extensions/yolo/tinyyolov3/grpc-cpu/server/inference_engine.py`
  - Function: `GetCvImageFromRawBytes(self, clientState, mediaSample)`
  ```python
  def GetCvImageFromRawBytes(self, clientState, mediaSample):
      try:
          # ...
          # Handle JPG, PNG, BMP content
          cvImage = None
          if  encoding == clientState._mediaStreamDescriptor.media_descriptor.video_frame_sample_format.Encoding.JPG or \
              encoding == clientState._mediaStreamDescriptor.media_descriptor.video_frame_sample_format.Encoding.PNG or \
              encoding == clientState._mediaStreamDescriptor.media_descriptor.video_frame_sample_format.Encoding.BMP:

              # np.frombuffer is zero copy command
              cvImage = cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(rawBytes, dtype=np.uint8), -1)
          # ...
          return cvImage
      except:
          PrintGetExceptionDetails()
          raise
  ```
  - Visualization:
    ```
    [Video Stream/Image Frame] --> gRPC Extension (inference_engine.py) --> GetCvImageFromRawBytes() --> cv2.imdecode() --> [Potential Buffer Overflow] --> RCE
    ```
  - Step-by-step analysis:
    1. The `ProcessMediaStream` function in `inference_engine.py` receives a `MediaStreamMessage` containing media data.
    2. It calls `GetCvImageFromRawBytes` to convert the raw bytes into a OpenCV image (`cvImage`).
    3. `GetCvImageFromRawBytes` checks the encoding type and if it's JPG, PNG, or BMP, it uses `cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(rawBytes, dtype=np.uint8), -1)` to decode the image.
    4. `cv2.imdecode` directly processes the `rawBytes` without any prior validation of the image format or content.
    5. If a malformed image is provided within `rawBytes`, and `cv2.imdecode` has a buffer overflow vulnerability, it can be triggered at this point.
    6. A successful buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption and potentially RCE.

- security test case:
  - Preconditions:
    - Deploy Azure Video Analyzer edge module and gRPC extension (YOLOv3 or Tiny YOLOv3).
    - Configure a live pipeline that uses the gRPC extension.
    - Obtain the endpoint to send video streams to the Azure Video Analyzer edge module.
  - Steps:
    1. Prepare a maliciously crafted JPEG, PNG, or BMP image designed to trigger a buffer overflow in `cv2.imdecode`. Tools like `honggfuzz`, `libfuzzer`, or manual crafting can be used to create such images.
    2. Create a Python script or use a tool like `curl` or `grpc_cli` to send a gRPC request to the deployed gRPC extension.
    3. The gRPC request should contain a `MediaStreamMessage` with the `media_sample` field populated with the crafted image data in the `content_bytes` field and the `encoding` set to the corresponding image format (e.g., JPG).
    4. Send the gRPC request to the gRPC extension's endpoint.
    5. Monitor the IoT Edge device for signs of exploitation, such as:
       - Unexpected crashes or restarts of the gRPC extension module.
       - Changes in system behavior indicating unauthorized access or code execution.
       - Examine logs for error messages from `cv2.imdecode` or related libraries that might indicate a crash or memory corruption.
  - Expected result:
    - If the vulnerability is successfully triggered, the gRPC extension module might crash, or in a successful exploit scenario, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
    - A successful test case would demonstrate the ability to cause a crash or anomalous behavior in the gRPC extension by sending the crafted image. For full validation of RCE, further steps like memory analysis and shellcode injection would be needed, which are beyond the scope of a basic test case but highlight the potential severity.
