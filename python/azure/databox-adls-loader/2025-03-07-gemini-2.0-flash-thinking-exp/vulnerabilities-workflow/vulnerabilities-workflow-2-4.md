* Vulnerability Name: Potential Credential Exposure in Logs
* Description:
    1. Python scripts (`copy-to-adls.py`, `copy-acls.py`) utilize the `logging` library for logging information.
    2. These scripts handle sensitive credentials, specifically the service principal client secret (`args.dest_spn_secret`).
    3. If logging is not configured securely and is set to a verbose level (e.g., DEBUG or INFO), there is a risk that the service principal secret or other sensitive information might be inadvertently logged.
    4. An attacker who gains access to the log files generated by these scripts could potentially extract the exposed credentials.
    5. Compromised service principal credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the target Azure Storage accounts and ADLS Gen2.
* Impact:
    If service principal credentials are logged and an attacker gains access to the logs, they can compromise the security of the Azure Storage accounts and ADLS Gen2, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * The scripts provide options to configure logging (`-f`, `--log-config`, `-l`, `--log-file`, `-v`, `--log-level`), allowing users to potentially control the verbosity and destination of logs.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Secure logging configuration by default: The default logging level should be set to WARNING or ERROR in production to minimize the risk of logging sensitive information.
    * Credential scrubbing: Implement mechanisms to scrub or mask sensitive information (like secrets) from log messages, even at debug levels.
    * Documentation and guidance: Provide clear documentation and best practices on how to configure logging securely, emphasizing the importance of avoiding logging sensitive credentials and securely storing log files.
* Preconditions:
    * An authorized user executes the Python scripts (`copy-to-adls.py`, `copy-acls.py`) with logging enabled, potentially at a verbose level (DEBUG or INFO).
    * The logging configuration is not secure and might write logs to a location accessible to unauthorized users.
    * An attacker gains unauthorized access to the log files generated by the scripts on the on-premise Hadoop cluster.
* Source code analysis:
    * **`copy-to-adls.py` and `copy-acls.py`**:
        ```python
        token_handler = OAuthBearerToken(args.dest_spn_id, args.dest_spn_secret)
        ```
        The scripts pass `args.dest_spn_secret` (service principal secret from command-line argument) to the `OAuthBearerToken` class. While the secret itself is not directly logged in the provided code, any detailed logging around the `OAuthBearerToken` initialization or usage *could* potentially log the secret if logging is overly verbose or not carefully configured. For example, if the `OAuthBearerToken` class or the `requests` library it uses logs request details including parameters, the secret could be exposed. The risk is indirect but present if logging is not handled with security in mind.
    * **`adls_copy_utils.py`**:
        ```python
        class OAuthBearerToken:
            def __init__(self, client_id, client_secret):
                self.client_secret = client_secret # secret is stored here
                # ... potentially used in requests that could be logged by requests lib or custom logging if debug is enabled
        ```
        While not explicitly logging the secret, the `OAuthBearerToken` class stores the `client_secret`. If debug logging is enabled either within the `requests` library or through custom logging added to the `OAuthBearerToken` class (which is not shown in the provided code but is a general risk), the secret *could* be logged during HTTP request details or debugging information.
* Security test case:
    1. Modify `copy-to-adls.py` or `copy-acls.py` to enable debug logging by setting the log level to DEBUG, either through command-line arguments (`-v DEBUG`) or by directly modifying the `logging.basicConfig` call in `AdlsCopyUtils.configureLogging`.
    2. Execute the modified script with valid service principal credentials (client ID and secret) and other required parameters. For example:
        ```bash
        ./copy-to-adls.py -v DEBUG -s source_account -k source_key -c source_container -A dest_account -C dest_container -I spn_client_id -S spn_client_secret
        ```
    3. Check the log output (either stdout/stderr or the log file specified by `-l` if used).
    4. Examine the logs for any occurrences of the service principal secret (`spn_client_secret`). Look for log messages related to HTTP requests, authentication, or any debug information that might inadvertently include the secret.
    5. If the service principal secret is found in the logs, it confirms the potential for credential exposure through logging. Note that the default code might not directly log it, but verbose logging configurations increase this risk and insecure custom logging within the project or libraries used could lead to exposure.
