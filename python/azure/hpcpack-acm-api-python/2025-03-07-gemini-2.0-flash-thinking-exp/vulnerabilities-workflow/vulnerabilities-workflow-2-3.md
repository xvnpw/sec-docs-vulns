### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Access Token

- Description:
    - Users of this Python library might inadvertently hardcode their Azure HPC Pack ACM REST API `access_token` directly into their Python scripts.
    - This practice is explicitly suggested in the `README.md` file under the "Getting Started" section, where users are instructed to replace the placeholder `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` with their actual token:
        ```python
        hpc_acm.configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
        ```
    - If these Python scripts, containing the hardcoded `access_token`, are unintentionally exposed (e.g., committed to public version control repositories, shared through insecure channels, left in publicly accessible locations), an attacker could easily extract the `access_token`.

- Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access to HPC Cluster: An attacker who obtains a valid `access_token` can use it to authenticate with the Azure HPC Pack ACM REST API.
    - Full API Access: With a compromised `access_token`, the attacker can potentially perform any API actions that the legitimate user associated with the token is authorized to perform. This could include:
        - Retrieving sensitive information about the HPC cluster configuration, nodes, and jobs.
        - Modifying cluster settings, potentially disrupting operations.
        - Canceling or creating jobs, leading to resource manipulation or denial of service.
        - Accessing job outputs and results, potentially leading to data breaches.
    - The severity of the impact depends on the permissions associated with the compromised `access_token`. In many scenarios, it could lead to significant security breaches and operational disruptions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project does not implement any mitigations to prevent users from hardcoding access tokens. It relies solely on users following general security best practices, which are not explicitly documented or enforced within the library itself. The `README.md` actually encourages the insecure practice of hardcoding the token for initial setup.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Security Warning in Documentation: The documentation, especially the "Getting Started" section in `README.md`, should prominently display a strong warning against hardcoding `access_token` directly in scripts.
    - Secure Token Storage Recommendations: The documentation should provide clear and detailed recommendations for secure alternatives to hardcoding access tokens, such as:
        - Using environment variables to store the `access_token`.
        - Storing the `access_token` in secure configuration files with restricted access permissions.
        - Utilizing secure credential management solutions like Azure Key Vault for production environments.
    - Updated Code Examples: The code examples in `README.md` and other documentation should be updated to demonstrate how to securely configure the `access_token` using environment variables or configuration files instead of directly hardcoding it.
    - Runtime Warning: The library could be enhanced to include a runtime warning or message when it detects that the `access_token` is being set directly as a string literal in the configuration. This warning should advise users about the security risks of hardcoding tokens and guide them towards more secure methods.

- Preconditions:
    - User Hardcodes Access Token: A user must follow the insecure practice of hardcoding their `access_token` directly into a Python script when using the `hpc-acm` library.
    - Script Exposure: The Python script containing the hardcoded `access_token` must be exposed to an attacker. This could happen through various means, including:
        - Public Code Repositories: Accidentally committing the script to a public GitHub or similar repository.
        - Insecure Sharing: Sharing the script via email or other insecure communication channels.
        - Publicly Accessible Storage: Storing the script in a publicly accessible cloud storage location or web server.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `README.md` File:
        - The "Getting Started" section in the `README.md` file provides an example of how to configure the API client.
        - It directly instructs users to set the `access_token` attribute of the `hpc_acm.configuration` object by assigning a string literal:
            ```python
            hpc_acm.configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
            ```
        - This example actively promotes the insecure practice of hardcoding the access token within the script itself.

    - `hpc_acm/configuration.py` File:
        - The `Configuration` class in `hpc_acm/configuration.py` defines the `access_token` attribute:
            ```python
            class Configuration(six.with_metaclass(TypeWithDefault, object)):
                ...
                # access token for OAuth
                self.access_token = ""
                ...
            ```
        - The library's configuration is designed to directly accept and store the `access_token` as provided by the user, without any built-in mechanisms to discourage hardcoding or guide users toward secure storage practices.
        - There are no security checks or warnings implemented within the `Configuration` class or elsewhere in the library to alert users about the risks associated with hardcoding sensitive credentials.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup Test Environment:
        - You will need access to an Azure HPC Pack ACM REST API endpoint for testing purposes. If you don't have a public test endpoint, you can set up a local test environment or use a demo environment if available.
        - Ensure you have the `hpc-acm` Python library installed in your test environment.
    2. Create Insecure Script:
        - Create a Python script (e.g., `insecure_script.py`) that utilizes the `hpc-acm` library.
        - In this script, hardcode a dummy `access_token` directly into the configuration, mimicking the example in `README.md`:
            ```python
            import hpc_acm

            hpc_acm.configuration.host = 'https://YOUR_SERVER_NAME/YOUR_PATH' # Replace with a test API endpoint
            hpc_acm.configuration.access_token = 'INSECURE_HARDCODED_TOKEN' # Dummy access token

            api_instance = hpc_acm.DefaultApi()

            try:
                nodes = api_instance.get_nodes() # Example API call
                print("Successfully accessed nodes using hardcoded token.")
            except hpc_acm.rest.ApiException as e:
                print(f"API Exception: {e}")
            ```
    3. Expose the Script (Simulate Public Exposure):
        - To simulate public exposure, you can:
            - Create a public GitHub repository and commit `insecure_script.py`. (For testing purposes, you can make it private and grant access to a test attacker account).
            - Alternatively, you can simply place the `insecure_script.py` in a publicly accessible folder on a web server or cloud storage (ensure this is only for testing and not a production environment).
    4. Attacker Access and Token Extraction:
        - As an attacker, access the publicly exposed script (`insecure_script.py`).
        - Manually examine the script's content and easily identify and extract the hardcoded `access_token` (`INSECURE_HARDCODED_TOKEN`).
    5. Attempt API Access with Extracted Token:
        - Using a separate Python script or tool (or within the same script, but in a different context to simulate an attacker), configure the `hpc-acm` library with the extracted `access_token`:
            ```python
            import hpc_acm

            hpc_acm.configuration.host = 'https://YOUR_SERVER_NAME/YOUR_PATH' # Use the same test API endpoint
            hpc_acm.configuration.access_token = 'INSECURE_HARDCODED_TOKEN' # Extracted token

            api_instance = hpc_acm.DefaultApi()

            try:
                nodes = api_instance.get_nodes() # Attempt the same API call
                print("Attacker: Successfully accessed nodes using extracted token.")
                # If successful, the attacker can now access the HPC cluster API.
            except hpc_acm.rest.ApiException as e:
                print(f"Attacker API Exception: {e}")
            ```
    6. Verify Unauthorized Access:
        - Run the attacker's script or tool.
        - If the attacker's script successfully executes the API call (e.g., `get_nodes()` in the example) and receives a valid response (not an authentication error), it confirms that the hardcoded `access_token` has been successfully compromised and can be used for unauthorized API access.
        - Observe the output of both scripts. The "Attacker: Successfully accessed nodes using extracted token." message (if printed) in the attacker's script, combined with successful API access in both scripts, validates the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how easily an attacker can exploit a hardcoded access token to gain unauthorized access to the HPC cluster API, confirming the vulnerability.
