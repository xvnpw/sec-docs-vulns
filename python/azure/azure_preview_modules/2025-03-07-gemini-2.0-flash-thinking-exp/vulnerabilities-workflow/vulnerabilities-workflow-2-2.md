## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Azure Credentials in Ansible Playbooks

- Description:
  1. An attacker gains access to an Ansible playbook that utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
  2. The playbook contains hardcoded Azure credentials (e.g., `subscription_id`, `client_id`, `secret`) directly embedded as variables or within task parameters.
  3. The attacker extracts these credentials from the playbook file.
  4. Using the extracted credentials, the attacker authenticates to the victim's Azure environment.
  5. The attacker gains unauthorized access to manage and provision Azure resources within the victim's Azure subscription, according to the permissions associated with the compromised credentials.

- Impact:
  - High
  - Unauthorized access to the user's Azure environment.
  - Potential for complete compromise of Azure resources, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion, depending on the scope of the compromised Azure credentials.
  - Resource hijacking and malicious resource provisioning within the victim's Azure subscription, leading to financial loss and operational disruption.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. This vulnerability is due to user misconfiguration and not directly mitigable by the Ansible role itself. The role doesn't enforce secure credential management.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Documentation should be added to strongly discourage hardcoding credentials in Ansible playbooks.
    - Emphasize the security risks associated with hardcoding credentials.
    - Recommend secure credential management practices, such as:
      - Using Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data within playbooks.
      - Utilizing Ansible lookups to retrieve credentials from secure external sources (e.g., environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault - although this role doesn't directly manage Azure Key Vault).
      - Leveraging managed identities (MSI) where applicable to avoid storing credentials altogether.
  - Security test cases demonstrating insecure credential handling should be added to highlight the vulnerability and encourage secure practices (although these tests would be for demonstration and not directly test the role's code).

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker must gain access to an Ansible playbook file that:
    - Utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
    - Contains hardcoded Azure credentials.
  - The user of the Ansible role must have insecurely embedded Azure credentials directly into their Ansible playbooks instead of using secure credential management practices.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - Vulnerability is not within the provided source code of the Ansible role.
  - The role itself (`azure.azure_preview_modules`) doesn't handle credential storage or exposure.
  - The newly analyzed files ( `/code/library/_azure_rm_functionapp_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_trafficmanagerprofile_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_route.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_subnet.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebussaspolicy.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_autoscale.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqldatabase.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebusqueue.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mysqlconfiguration_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_snapshot.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_deployment.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_virtualmachine_extension.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_routetable.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetextension.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mariadbdatabase_facts.py`) are Ansible modules and facts modules that manage various Azure resources.
  - These modules do not introduce new vulnerabilities related to credential exposure. They focus on using the Azure SDK to interact with Azure services.
  - The test files within the project correctly utilize environment variables for credentials, demonstrating a secure practice for testing purposes within the role's development. However, this does not enforce or guarantee secure credential management by users who adopt this role in their own Ansible playbooks.
  - The vulnerability remains with the *user* who might insecurely create Ansible playbooks using this role and fail to adopt secure credential management practices.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a sample Ansible playbook (outside of the project's test suite to represent user-created playbook) that utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
  2. **Intentionally hardcode** Azure credentials (replace placeholders with actual or dummy credentials for demonstration purposes only, never use real production credentials in a test case) within the playbook, for example:
     ```yaml
     - hosts: localhost
       roles:
         - azure.azure_preview_modules
       vars:
         azure_subscription_id: "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
         azure_client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
         azure_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
         resource_group_name: "test-rg"
         storage_account_name: "teststorage"
       tasks:
         - name: Create Resource Group
           azure_rm_resourcegroup:
             name: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
             location: eastus
           delegate_to: localhost

         - name: Create Storage Account
           azure_rm_storageaccount:
             resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
             name: "{{ storage_account_name }}"
             account_type: Standard_LRS
             delegate_to: localhost
     ```
  3. Store this playbook in a publicly accessible location (e.g., a public GitHub repository - for demonstration purposes only and with dummy credentials!).
  4. As an attacker, access the publicly available playbook file.
  5. Extract the hardcoded credentials ( `azure_subscription_id`, `azure_client_id`, `azure_secret`) from the playbook file.
  6. Using the Azure CLI or Azure SDK (outside of Ansible), authenticate to Azure using the extracted credentials.
  7. Verify successful authentication and the ability to list Azure resources within the specified subscription, demonstrating unauthorized access.
  8. **Important**: After the test, immediately remove the playbook and ensure no real credentials were used and exposed. This test case is for demonstration purposes only to highlight the risk of insecure credential handling by users, and should not be performed with production credentials or in a real-world attack scenario.
