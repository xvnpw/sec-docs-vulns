## Vulnerability List for azure.azure_preview_modules

**Project Description**

This repository provides an Ansible role, written in YAML and likely Python, designed to manage and provision various Azure resources.

**Attack Vector**

An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the Ansible modules provided by this role to gain unauthorized access or control over Azure resources managed by these modules. By manipulating module parameters or exploiting logical flaws in the modules, an attacker could perform actions beyond the intended scope of the role, leading to security breaches in the managed Azure infrastructure.

**Vulnerability 1: Ansible Module Parameter Manipulation for Unauthorized Resource Access/Control**

- Description:
    1. An attacker identifies an Ansible module within this role, for example, the `azure_rm_route` module for managing Azure routes.
    2. The attacker analyzes the module's parameters, either through documentation (if available) or by examining the module's code (if accessible in the repository).
    3. The attacker crafts a malicious Ansible playbook that utilizes the vulnerable module. This playbook manipulates module parameters in a way not intended by the role's developers.
    4. For instance, in the `azure_rm_route` module, the attacker might try to manipulate `address_prefix` or `next_hop_ip_address` parameters with values that are not properly validated by the module. They might attempt to inject invalid CIDR ranges, private IPs when public are expected or vice versa, or other unexpected inputs.
    5. Upon execution of this malicious playbook, the Ansible module interacts with Azure, potentially performing unauthorized actions on Azure resources. In the case of `azure_rm_route`, this could lead to creating routes that redirect network traffic to attacker-controlled destinations, disrupting network connectivity, or bypassing security measures.

- Impact:
    - High
    - Unauthorized access to and control over Azure resources.
    - Potential data breaches due to unauthorized redirection of network traffic or misconfiguration of network resources.
    - Resource manipulation or deletion leading to service disruption or data loss.
    - Escalation of privileges within the Azure environment by compromising network configurations.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the provided files, there is no specific code available to analyze for implemented mitigations within the Ansible modules beyond basic type checking in `module_arg_spec`. The `SECURITY.md` file provides generic security reporting guidelines but no specific code-level mitigations are mentioned in the provided files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Ansible modules, especially for parameters that directly influence Azure resource configurations. This should include checks for allowed values, formats, ranges, and potentially using regular expressions or other validation techniques to prevent injection of malicious or unexpected data.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege within the Ansible modules to restrict actions performed on Azure to the minimum necessary for the intended functionality. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be misused if a vulnerability is exploited.
    - **Security audits and code reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of Ansible modules to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities, including parameter manipulation flaws.
    - **Security test cases:** Develop and implement security test cases specifically targeting parameter manipulation vulnerabilities in Ansible modules. These tests should cover various modules and parameters, attempting to inject invalid or malicious inputs to assess the module's resilience.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to have the ability to execute Ansible playbooks that utilize this role. This could be through compromised CI/CD pipelines, access to systems where this role is used, or by convincing an authorized user to run a malicious playbook.
    - Vulnerable Ansible modules must exist within the role. Specifically modules that manage resources and accept parameters without proper validation are susceptible.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code for Ansible modules is provided in PROJECT FILES, therefore static analysis is possible.
    - Many Ansible modules, including `azure_rm_route.py`, use `module_arg_spec` for defining parameters and basic type checking. However, this mechanism primarily enforces data types (string, int, bool, etc.) and choices from a predefined list, but might lack deeper content validation and sanitization against malicious inputs.
    - Example scenario based on `azure_rm_route.py`:
      ```python
      # File: /code/library/azure_rm_route.py
      def __init__(self):
          self.module_arg_spec = dict(
              resource_group=dict(type='str', required=True),
              name=dict(type='str', required=True),
              state=dict(type='str', default='present', choices=['present', 'absent']),
              address_prefix=dict(type='str'), # Potential vulnerability: no specific validation
              next_hop_type=dict(type='str',
                                 choices=['virtual_network_gateway',
                                          'vnet_local',
                                          'internet',
                                          'virtual_appliance',
                                          'none'],
                                 default='none'),
              next_hop_ip_address=dict(type='str'), # Potential vulnerability: no specific validation
              route_table_name=dict(type='str', required=True)
          )
      ```
      In `azure_rm_route.py`, the `address_prefix` and `next_hop_ip_address` parameters are defined as `type='str'` without further validation rules specified in `module_arg_spec`. If the underlying Azure SDK or API does not sufficiently validate these inputs, or if the module logic itself has flaws, an attacker could potentially inject malicious strings. For example, in `address_prefix`, an attacker might try to provide an overly broad CIDR range or an invalid format that could cause routing misconfigurations. For `next_hop_ip_address`, if not properly validated to be a valid IP address under expected conditions, it might allow unintended routing targets.
      While `next_hop_type` has `choices` defined, limiting allowed values, parameters like `address_prefix` and `next_hop_ip_address` rely on implicit validation or lack thereof, making them potential points for parameter manipulation attacks.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up an Ansible environment with the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role installed.
        - Have an Azure account with permissions to create and manage network resources within a test resource group, specifically route tables and routes.
    2. **Vulnerability Test:**
        - Create a malicious Ansible playbook that uses the `azure_rm_route` module.
        - In the playbook, attempt to manipulate the `address_prefix` parameter with an invalid or overly broad CIDR range, such as `"0.0.0.0/0"` (if not intended for this module) or `"invalid_cidr"`. Alternatively, try to manipulate `next_hop_ip_address` with an invalid IP format or a private IP address when a public one is expected, for example `"10.10.10.10"` when routing to the internet is intended.
        - Execute the malicious playbook against the test Azure environment.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine Ansible execution output logs for any errors or warnings that indicate parameter manipulation attempts and their outcomes.
        - Check the Azure environment to see if the route was created or updated. If the vulnerability exists, the route might be created with the manipulated (invalid or insecure) `address_prefix` or `next_hop_ip_address`.
        - Specifically, verify if a route with an overly permissive or invalid `address_prefix` was created, or if `next_hop_ip_address` was accepted even if it's an invalid or unintended IP address based on the module's intended use.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The vulnerability is confirmed if the attacker is able to successfully manipulate module parameters (e.g., `address_prefix`, `next_hop_ip_address`) to cause unintended or insecure configurations in the Azure environment, such as creation of routes with invalid or overly permissive configurations, demonstrating a potential attack vector. If input validation is properly implemented, the test should fail, indicating no vulnerability for the tested parameter and module. However, further tests on other modules and parameters are needed to ensure complete security coverage across all modules in the role.
