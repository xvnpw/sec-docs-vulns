## Combined Vulnerability List

### Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability in Python Dependency Installation

- **Description:**
  1. The Ansible role instructs users to manually install Python dependencies by running `pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_preview_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt` as described in `/code/README.md`.
  2. This command fetches and installs Python packages listed in the `requirements-azure.txt` file from PyPI (Python Package Index).
  3. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker can intercept the network traffic during the `pip install` process.
  4. The attacker replaces the legitimate Python packages in `requirements-azure.txt` with malicious packages hosted on a rogue PyPI server or through DNS spoofing.
  5. When a user executes the `pip install` command, they unknowingly download and install the malicious packages from attacker controlled source.
  6. These malicious packages can contain arbitrary code that the attacker controls, leading to system compromise.

- **Impact:**
  - Critical: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the user running `pip install`. This can lead to:
    - Full control of the user's system.
    - Data exfiltration, including Azure credentials if configured in the Ansible environment.
    - Deployment of backdoors for persistent access.
    - Lateral movement within the user's network if the compromised system is part of a larger infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None: The project does not implement any mitigations against MITM attacks during dependency installation. The `skip_azure_sdk: true` default variable in `defaults/main.yml` might seem like a mitigation, but it actually disables the dependency installation task in the Ansible role itself, not the user's manual installation step described in the README. The provided files like `/code/library/_azure_rm_managed_disk.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqlconfiguration.py`, etc., do not contain any code related to dependency installation or MITM mitigation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implement dependency integrity checks:
    - Hash checking: Include hashes (e.g., SHA256) of each package in `requirements-azure.txt`. `pip install` can verify package integrity using hashes, preventing installation of modified packages.
    - Consider using a dependency lock file: Generate a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile.lock` file that pins down exact versions and hashes of dependencies.

  - Improve user instructions:
    - Warn users about the MITM vulnerability in the README.
    - Recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the role's dependencies.
    - Suggest installing dependencies over a trusted network (e.g., corporate VPN or direct connection).

- **Preconditions:**
  - User must follow the installation instructions in `README.md` and execute the `pip install -r requirements-azure.txt` command.
  - A MITM attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user's system and PyPI during the dependency download. This could be on a public Wi-Fi network, compromised network infrastructure, or through ARP spoofing on a local network.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - File: `/code/README.md`
  ```markdown
  2. Upgrade Azure Python SDKs required by new Azure modules.

  ``` bash
  $ pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_preview_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt
  ```
  - The `README.md` file provides instructions to install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements-azure.txt`.
  - The `requirements-azure.txt` file is located within the role's `files` directory (not included in this PROJECT FILES, but assumed from project description).
  - The `pip install` command, as used in the README, does not include any integrity checks (e.g., hashes) for the packages listed in `requirements-azure.txt`.
  - Examining the provided Python files (e.g., `/code/library/_azure_rm_managed_disk.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqlconfiguration.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualmachine_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mariadbserver.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabschedule.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabschedule_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetinstance_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_iothubconsumergroup.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_sqlserver.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mariadbdatabase_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqlserver_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqlserver.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_appserviceplan_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_loadbalancer.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_keyvaultsecret.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqldatabase_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_sqlfirewallrule_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebustopic.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_securitygroup_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabarmtemplate_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mariadbserver_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabartifact_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqlserver_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_loganalyticsworkspace.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_image.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_containerregistrywebhook.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mysqlconfiguration_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualnetworkpeering_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_iothubconsumergroup.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_sqlserver.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mariadbdatabase_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqlserver_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqlserver.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_appserviceplan_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_loadbalancer.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_keyvaultsecret.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqldatabase_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_sqlfirewallrule_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebustopic.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_securitygroup_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabarmtemplate_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mariadbserver_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabartifact_info.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_postgresqlserver_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_loganalyticsworkspace.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_image.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_containerregistrywebhook.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mysqlconfiguration_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualnetworkpeering_info.py`) confirms that none of these module files contain code for dependency installation or implement any MITM protection mechanisms for the user's manual installation step. The modules are focused on Azure resource management and do not address the dependency installation security.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Set up a controlled MITM environment to intercept network traffic. This could involve using tools like `Ettercap`, `mitmproxy`, or setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point.
  2. Create a malicious Python package that will be used to replace a legitimate package from `requirements-azure.txt`. This malicious package should contain code to demonstrate successful compromise (e.g., create a file in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`).
  3. Modify the MITM setup to intercept requests to PyPI for the legitimate package and redirect them to the malicious package. This can be done by DNS spoofing or manipulating HTTP traffic.
  4. On a test system, install the Ansible role using `ansible-galaxy install azure.azure_preview_modules`.
  5. Navigate to the installed role directory (e.g., `~/.ansible/roles/azure.azure_preview_modules/files`).
  6. Execute the dependency installation command: `pip install -r requirements-azure.txt`.
  7. Observe if the malicious package is installed instead of the legitimate one.
  8. Check for indicators of compromise on the test system (e.g., the presence of the file created by the malicious package).
  9. If the malicious code executes successfully, it confirms the vulnerability.

### Insecure Storage of Azure Credentials in Ansible Playbooks

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker gains access to an Ansible playbook that utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
  2. The playbook contains hardcoded Azure credentials (e.g., `subscription_id`, `client_id`, `secret`) directly embedded as variables or within task parameters.
  3. The attacker extracts these credentials from the playbook file.
  4. Using the extracted credentials, the attacker authenticates to the victim's Azure environment.
  5. The attacker gains unauthorized access to manage and provision Azure resources within the victim's Azure subscription, according to the permissions associated with the compromised credentials.

- **Impact:**
  - High
  - Unauthorized access to the user's Azure environment.
  - Potential for complete compromise of Azure resources, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion, depending on the scope of the compromised Azure credentials.
  - Resource hijacking and malicious resource provisioning within the victim's Azure subscription, leading to financial loss and operational disruption.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. This vulnerability is due to user misconfiguration and not directly mitigable by the Ansible role itself. The role doesn't enforce secure credential management.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Documentation should be added to strongly discourage hardcoding credentials in Ansible playbooks.
    - Emphasize the security risks associated with hardcoding credentials.
    - Recommend secure credential management practices, such as:
      - Using Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data within playbooks.
      - Utilizing Ansible lookups to retrieve credentials from secure external sources (e.g., environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault - although this role doesn't directly manage Azure Key Vault).
      - Leveraging managed identities (MSI) where applicable to avoid storing credentials altogether.
  - Security test cases demonstrating insecure credential handling should be added to highlight the vulnerability and encourage secure practices (although these tests would be for demonstration and not directly test the role's code).

- **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must gain access to an Ansible playbook file that:
    - Utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
    - Contains hardcoded Azure credentials.
  - The user of the Ansible role must have insecurely embedded Azure credentials directly into their Ansible playbooks instead of using secure credential management practices.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - Vulnerability is not within the provided source code of the Ansible role.
  - The role itself (`azure.azure_preview_modules`) doesn't handle credential storage or exposure.
  - The newly analyzed files ( `/code/library/_azure_rm_functionapp_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_trafficmanagerprofile_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_route.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_subnet.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebussaspolicy.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_autoscale.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqldatabase.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebusqueue.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mysqlconfiguration_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_snapshot.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_deployment.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_virtualmachine_extension.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_routetable.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetextension.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mariadbdatabase_facts.py`) are Ansible modules and facts modules that manage various Azure resources.
  - These modules do not introduce new vulnerabilities related to credential exposure. They focus on using the Azure SDK to interact with Azure services.
  - The test files within the project correctly utilize environment variables for credentials, demonstrating a secure practice for testing purposes within the role's development. However, this does not enforce or guarantee secure credential management by users who adopt this role in their own Ansible playbooks.
  - The vulnerability remains with the *user* who might insecurely create Ansible playbooks using this role and fail to adopt secure credential management practices.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create a sample Ansible playbook (outside of the project's test suite to represent user-created playbook) that utilizes the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
  2. **Intentionally hardcode** Azure credentials (replace placeholders with actual or dummy credentials for demonstration purposes only, never use real production credentials in a test case) within the playbook, for example:
     ```yaml
     - hosts: localhost
       roles:
         - azure.azure_preview_modules
       vars:
         azure_subscription_id: "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
         azure_client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
         azure_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
         resource_group_name: "test-rg"
         storage_account_name: "teststorage"
       tasks:
         - name: Create Resource Group
           azure_rm_resourcegroup:
             name: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
             location: eastus
           delegate_to: localhost

         - name: Create Storage Account
           azure_rm_storageaccount:
             resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
             name: "{{ storage_account_name }}"
             account_type: Standard_LRS
             delegate_to: localhost
     ```
  3. Store this playbook in a publicly accessible location (e.g., a public GitHub repository - for demonstration purposes only and with dummy credentials!).
  4. As an attacker, access the publicly available playbook file.
  5. Extract the hardcoded credentials ( `azure_subscription_id`, `azure_client_id`, `azure_secret`) from the playbook file.
  6. Using the Azure CLI or Azure SDK (outside of Ansible), authenticate to Azure using the extracted credentials.
  7. Verify successful authentication and the ability to list Azure resources within the specified subscription, demonstrating unauthorized access.
  8. **Important**: After the test, immediately remove the playbook and ensure no real credentials were used and exposed. This test case is for demonstration purposes only to highlight the risk of insecure credential handling by users, and should not be performed with production credentials or in a real-world attack scenario.

### Ansible Module Parameter Manipulation for Unauthorized Resource Access/Control

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker identifies an Ansible module within this role, for example, the `azure_rm_route` module for managing Azure routes.
    2. The attacker analyzes the module's parameters, either through documentation (if available) or by examining the module's code (if accessible in the repository).
    3. The attacker crafts a malicious Ansible playbook that utilizes the vulnerable module. This playbook manipulates module parameters in a way not intended by the role's developers.
    4. For instance, in the `azure_rm_route` module, the attacker might try to manipulate `address_prefix` or `next_hop_ip_address` parameters with values that are not properly validated by the module. They might attempt to inject invalid CIDR ranges, private IPs when public are expected or vice versa, or other unexpected inputs.
    5. Upon execution of this malicious playbook, the Ansible module interacts with Azure, potentially performing unauthorized actions on Azure resources. In the case of `azure_rm_route`, this could lead to creating routes that redirect network traffic to attacker-controlled destinations, disrupting network connectivity, or bypassing security measures.

- **Impact:**
    - High
    - Unauthorized access to and control over Azure resources.
    - Potential data breaches due to unauthorized redirection of network traffic or misconfiguration of network resources.
    - Resource manipulation or deletion leading to service disruption or data loss.
    - Escalation of privileges within the Azure environment by compromising network configurations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Unknown. Based on the provided files, there is no specific code available to analyze for implemented mitigations within the Ansible modules beyond basic type checking in `module_arg_spec`. The `SECURITY.md` file provides generic security reporting guidelines but no specific code-level mitigations are mentioned in the provided files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Ansible modules, especially for parameters that directly influence Azure resource configurations. This should include checks for allowed values, formats, ranges, and potentially using regular expressions or other validation techniques to prevent injection of malicious or unexpected data.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege within the Ansible modules to restrict actions performed on Azure to the minimum necessary for the intended functionality. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be misused if a vulnerability is exploited.
    - **Security audits and code reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of Ansible modules to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities, including parameter manipulation flaws.
    - **Security test cases:** Develop and implement security test cases specifically targeting parameter manipulation vulnerabilities in Ansible modules. These tests should cover various modules and parameters, attempting to inject invalid or malicious inputs to assess the module's resilience.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker needs to have the ability to execute Ansible playbooks that utilize this role. This could be through compromised CI/CD pipelines, access to systems where this role is used, or by convincing an authorized user to run a malicious playbook.
    - Vulnerable Ansible modules must exist within the role. Specifically modules that manage resources and accept parameters without proper validation are susceptible.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Source code for Ansible modules is provided in PROJECT FILES, therefore static analysis is possible.
    - Many Ansible modules, including `azure_rm_route.py`, use `module_arg_spec` for defining parameters and basic type checking. However, this mechanism primarily enforces data types (string, int, bool, etc.) and choices from a predefined list, but might lack deeper content validation and sanitization against malicious inputs.
    - Example scenario based on `azure_rm_route.py`:
      ```python
      # File: /code/library/azure_rm_route.py
      def __init__(self):
          self.module_arg_spec = dict(
              resource_group=dict(type='str', required=True),
              name=dict(type='str', required=True),
              state=dict(type='str', default='present', choices=['present', 'absent']),
              address_prefix=dict(type='str'), # Potential vulnerability: no specific validation
              next_hop_type=dict(type='str',
                                 choices=['virtual_network_gateway',
                                          'vnet_local',
                                          'internet',
                                          'virtual_appliance',
                                          'none'],
                                 default='none'),
              next_hop_ip_address=dict(type='str'), # Potential vulnerability: no specific validation
              route_table_name=dict(type='str', required=True)
          )
      ```
      In `azure_rm_route.py`, the `address_prefix` and `next_hop_ip_address` parameters are defined as `type='str'` without further validation rules specified in `module_arg_spec`. If the underlying Azure SDK or API does not sufficiently validate these inputs, or if the module logic itself has flaws, an attacker could potentially inject malicious strings. For example, in `address_prefix`, an attacker might try to provide an overly broad CIDR range or an invalid format that could cause routing misconfigurations. For `next_hop_ip_address`, if not properly validated to be a valid IP address under expected conditions, it might allow unintended routing targets.
      While `next_hop_type` has `choices` defined, limiting allowed values, parameters like `address_prefix` and `next_hop_ip_address` rely on implicit validation or lack thereof, making them potential points for parameter manipulation attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up an Ansible environment with the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role installed.
        - Have an Azure account with permissions to create and manage network resources within a test resource group, specifically route tables and routes.
    2. **Vulnerability Test:**
        - Create a malicious Ansible playbook that uses the `azure_rm_route` module.
        - In the playbook, attempt to manipulate the `address_prefix` parameter with an invalid or overly broad CIDR range, such as `"0.0.0.0/0"` (if not intended for this module) or `"invalid_cidr"`. Alternatively, try to manipulate `next_hop_ip_address` with an invalid IP format or a private IP address when a public one is expected, for example `"10.10.10.10"` when routing to the internet is intended.
        - Execute the malicious playbook against the test Azure environment.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine Ansible execution output logs for any errors or warnings that indicate parameter manipulation attempts and their outcomes.
        - Check the Azure environment to see if the route was created or updated. If the vulnerability exists, the route might be created with the manipulated (invalid or insecure) `address_prefix` or `next_hop_ip_address`.
        - Specifically, verify if a route with an overly permissive or invalid `address_prefix` was created, or if `next_hop_ip_address` was accepted even if it's an invalid or unintended IP address based on the module's intended use.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The vulnerability is confirmed if the attacker is able to successfully manipulate module parameters (e.g., `address_prefix`, `next_hop_ip_address`) to cause unintended or insecure configurations in the Azure environment, such as creation of routes with invalid or overly permissive configurations, demonstrating a potential attack vector. If input validation is properly implemented, the test should fail, indicating no vulnerability for the tested parameter and module. However, further tests on other modules and parameters are needed to ensure complete security coverage across all modules in the role.

### Outdated Ansible Modules

- **Description:** The project uses outdated Ansible modules for Azure resource management because it is no longer maintained and encourages users to switch to AzCollection. Users who continue to use this repository are exposed to vulnerabilities present in the outdated Ansible modules. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct insecure configurations of Azure resources through infrastructure automation.

- **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in outdated Ansible modules can lead to insecure Azure resource configurations. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to Azure resources, modify configurations for malicious purposes, or exfiltrate sensitive data depending on the specific vulnerabilities and the roles using these modules.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project README.md explicitly states that the repository is not maintained and directs users to the official AzCollection, which is a form of documentation-based mitigation by advising users to migrate to a maintained solution.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The project should be archived or marked as deprecated in GitHub to further discourage usage.
    - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment of the modules are missing.
    - Automated checks to warn users about outdated dependencies are missing.
    - There are no implemented code-level mitigations within the roles themselves to address vulnerabilities in the underlying Ansible modules.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Users must choose to use this unmaintained Ansible role for Azure resource management instead of the official and maintained AzCollection.
    - The outdated Ansible modules used by this project must contain exploitable security vulnerabilities.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - The file clearly states: `# This repo is not maintained anymore, instead please go to [AzCollection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/azure).`
        - This indicates that the modules are not actively maintained and might contain outdated and vulnerable code.
    - File: `/code/defaults/main.yml`
        - The file contains `skip_azure_sdk: true`.
        - This setting, although seemingly intended for development or specific use-cases, can contribute to security risks if it leads to using less secure or outdated Azure SDK components instead of the latest recommended versions. However, without further code analysis of the modules themselves, it's hard to concretely assess the impact of this setting as a vulnerability on its own. It is more of a configuration choice with potential security implications depending on how it affects the overall module's dependency management and security posture.
    - Files: `/code/library/_azure_rm_functionapp_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_facts.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_trafficmanagerprofile_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_route.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_subnet.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebussaspolicy.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork_facts.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_autoscale.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_postgresqldatabase.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_servicebusqueue.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_mysqlconfiguration_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_applicationsecuritygroup_info.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_snapshot.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_deployment.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_virtualmachine_extension.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_devtestlabvirtualnetwork.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_routetable.py`, `/code/library/azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetextension.py`, `/code/library/_azure_rm_mariadbdatabase_facts.py`
        - These files are examples of individual Ansible modules for managing various Azure resources.
        - They are part of the `azure.azure_preview_modules` collection, which is explicitly stated as unmaintained.
        - Source code analysis of these and other modules within the project would be necessary to identify specific vulnerabilities within each module, especially concerning their dependencies on potentially outdated Azure SDKs and Ansible libraries.
        - For example, modules like `azure_rm_virtualmachinescaleset.py` and `azure_rm_subnet.py` manage critical infrastructure components, and vulnerabilities within them could lead to significant security misconfigurations.
        - The risk of using outdated modules is further amplified by the lack of recent updates and security patches, making it likely that known vulnerabilities in dependencies or the modules themselves remain unaddressed.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Vulnerability: Outdated Ansible Modules
    - Test Case Steps:
        1. Setup:
            - Set up an Ansible environment and install the `azure.azure_preview_modules` role as described in the README.md.
            - Configure Ansible to manage Azure resources, including setting up credentials.
        2. Vulnerability Scan:
            - Identify the specific versions of Ansible Azure modules included in this role (this might require inspecting the role's files or running Ansible with increased verbosity to see module versions).
            - Check for known vulnerabilities associated with these specific versions of Ansible Azure modules using public vulnerability databases (like CVE database) or security advisory websites.
        3. Exploit Attempt (Example - if a known vulnerability exists in `azure_rm_storageaccount` module of the outdated Ansible version):
            - Craft an Ansible playbook using `azure_rm_storageaccount` module from `azure.azure_preview_modules` role.
            - Attempt to exploit a known vulnerability. For example, if there's a known vulnerability that allows unauthorized modification of storage account configurations:
                - Create a vulnerable playbook that aims to modify storage account settings in a way that should be restricted by newer, patched Ansible modules, but is allowed by the outdated module.
                - Run the playbook against an Azure environment.
            - Expected Result:
                - If vulnerable, the playbook successfully exploits the vulnerability, e.g., by allowing insecure configuration changes that would be prevented by a patched module.
                - This demonstrates that using outdated modules leads to exploitable security weaknesses.
        4. Mitigation Check:
            - Attempt to perform the same action using the latest `azure.azcollection` Ansible modules.
            - Expected Result:
                - The latest modules, being maintained and patched, should prevent the exploitation, either by rejecting the insecure configuration or by having the vulnerability patched.
