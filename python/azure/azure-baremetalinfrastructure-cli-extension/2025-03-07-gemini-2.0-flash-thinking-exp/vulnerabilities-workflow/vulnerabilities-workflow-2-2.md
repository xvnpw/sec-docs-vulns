- Vulnerability Name: Parameter Injection in BareMetal Instance Commands

- Description:
    An attacker can inject malicious commands or payloads through the `--resource-group` and `--instance-name` parameters of the BareMetal instance commands. These parameters are directly passed to the Azure SDK client without sufficient sanitization. By manipulating these parameters, an attacker could potentially influence the API calls made by the extension, leading to unauthorized actions on BareMetal instances.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker uses the Azure CLI with the baremetal-infrastructure extension.
    2. The attacker crafts a command using `az baremetalinstance show`, `az baremetalinstance restart`, `az baremetalinstance start`, `az baremetalinstance shutdown`, `az baremetalinstance update`, or `az baremetalinstance delete`.
    3. In the command, the attacker provides a malicious payload within the `--resource-group` or `--instance-name` parameter. For example, using special characters or command injection sequences.
    4. The extension passes these parameters to the Azure SDK client, which constructs and sends an API request to the Azure Bare Metal Infrastructure service.
    5. If the Azure SDK or the backend service is vulnerable to parameter injection or improper handling of special characters passed through resource group or instance names, the attacker's payload could be executed or misinterpreted, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on Azure BareMetal instances. Depending on the backend service's vulnerability, this could range from information disclosure to unauthorized modification or deletion of instances. In a worst-case scenario, if the backend service is susceptible to command injection via resource group or instance names (which is less likely but needs to be considered as part of a full security assessment of the backend service, though not in scope of this extension), it might lead to significant security breaches. More realistically within the scope of this extension, if the backend service or SDK mishandles special characters, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, potentially disrupting the service or exposing internal information through error messages (though this is more of a stability/availability concern rather than direct unauthorized access via this extension's vulnerability).

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No input validation or sanitization is implemented in the provided code for `resource_group_name` or `instance_name` parameters within the extension itself. The parameters are directly passed to the Azure SDK client as seen in `custom.py`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation and sanitization for `resource_group_name` and `instance_name` parameters are missing. The extension should implement checks to ensure that these parameters conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or command injection sequences before passing them to the Azure SDK.

- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must have access to use the Azure CLI and install the `baremetal-infrastructure` extension.
    2. The attacker needs to know the command structure of the extension and the parameters it accepts.
    3. The Azure SDK or the backend Azure Bare Metal Infrastructure service must be vulnerable to improper handling of special characters or parameter injection via resource group or instance names (or at least exhibit unexpected behavior that could be further exploited).

- Source Code Analysis:

    1. **`_params.py`**:
        ```python
        def load_arguments(self, _):
            with self.argument_context('baremetalinstance') as c:
                c.argument('resource_group_name', arg_type=resource_group_name_type)
                c.argument('instance_name', options_list=['--instance-name', '-n'], help="The name of the BareMetalInstance", id_part='name')
        ```
        This file defines the parameters but does not include any validation logic. `resource_group_name_type` is imported from `azure.cli.core.commands.parameters`, and while it provides some basic structure, it does not inherently sanitize input against injection attacks.

    2. **`custom.py`**:
        ```python
        def show_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name):
            return client.get(resource_group_name, instance_name)

        def list_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name=None):
            if resource_group_name is None:
                return client.list_by_subscription()
            return client.list(resource_group_name)

        def restart_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name, force=False):
            custom_header = {}
            force_parameter = { "forceState": "active" if force else "inactive" }
            return client.begin_restart(resource_group_name, instance_name, force_parameter, headers=custom_header)

        def start_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name):
            custom_header = {}
            custom_header['Content-Type'] = 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
            return client.begin_start(resource_group_name, instance_name, headers=custom_header)

        def shutdown_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name):
            custom_header = {}
            custom_header['Content-Type'] = 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
            return client.begin_shutdown(resource_group_name, instance_name, headers=custom_header)

        def update_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name, **kwargs):
            return client.update(resource_group_name, instance_name, kwargs['parameters'].tags)

        def delete_baremetalinstance(client, resource_group_name, instance_name):
            return client.begin_delete(resource_group_name, instance_name)
        ```
        In `custom.py`, all functions directly pass the `resource_group_name` and `instance_name` parameters received from the CLI to the corresponding client methods (`client.get`, `client.list`, `client.begin_restart`, etc.). There is no validation, sanitization, or encoding of these parameters before they are used in the API calls. This direct passthrough creates a potential vulnerability if the Azure SDK or the backend service does not properly handle or sanitize these inputs.

- Security Test Case:

    Test Case Title: Parameter Injection in `baremetalinstance show` command

    Description: This test case verifies if malicious payloads in `--resource-group` and `--instance-name` parameters of the `az baremetalinstance show` command are handled securely.

    Preconditions:
    1. Azure CLI is installed.
    2. `baremetal-infrastructure` extension is installed.
    3. Access to an Azure subscription with permissions to manage BareMetal instances (or at least attempt to query them).

    Test Steps:
    1. Open a terminal with Azure CLI configured.
    2. Execute the following command to test `--resource-group` parameter injection:
       ```bash
       az baremetalinstance show --resource-group "$(malicious_command)" --instance-name testinstance
       ```
       Replace `$(malicious_command)` with a simple command injection attempt, for example: `testrg\`\` whoami\`\`` or `testrg'$(whoami)'`. For safety and to avoid actual execution, a less harmful command like `testrg\`\` --version\`\`` or `testrg'--version'` can be used to observe if the command is interpreted.
    3. Execute the following command to test `--instance-name` parameter injection:
       ```bash
       az baremetalinstance show --resource-group testrg --instance-name "$(malicious_command)"
       ```
       Replace `$(malicious_command)` with a simple command injection attempt, for example: `testinstance\`\` whoami\`\`` or `testinstance'$(whoami)'`.  Again, use safer alternatives like `--version` for initial testing.
    4. Analyze the output and any error messages.

    Expected Result:
    Ideally, the extension should either:
    *   Sanitize the input and prevent the injection. In this case, the command should execute normally (if valid resource group and instance names are used besides the malicious injection part) or fail gracefully due to invalid resource group or instance name format after sanitization.
    *   If sanitization is not implemented, and the Azure SDK or backend service is vulnerable, the malicious command part might get executed or cause unexpected errors, potentially indicating a vulnerability.

    If the command injection is successful in disrupting the command execution in an unexpected way (beyond just "resource not found" or "invalid parameter name"), or if error messages suggest misinterpretation of the injected part as a command, it would confirm the vulnerability. If the commands fail with standard Azure CLI error messages related to resource not found or parameter validation (by Azure CLI itself, not the extension), it might suggest that the immediate injection is not directly exploitable in this extension *but* the lack of sanitization still represents a risk that needs mitigation. Further investigation on how the Azure SDK and backend service handle these parameters would be needed to fully assess the backend vulnerability. However, for the extension itself, the lack of sanitization is a vulnerability regardless of the backend's behavior.

This vulnerability list provides a starting point for addressing security concerns in the `azure-baremetalinfrastructure-cli-extension`. Implementing input sanitization for resource identifiers is crucial to mitigate potential injection attacks.
