#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `azslurm cost` output directory

- **Description:**
    1. The `azslurm cost` command in `slurmcc/cli.py` allows users to specify an output directory using the `-o OUT` parameter.
    2. The `CostSlurm` class in `slurmcc/cost.py` processes this parameter and creates the directory using `os.makedirs(out, exist_ok=True)`.
    3. The `os.makedirs` function, when provided with a path containing path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths starting from the root `/`, will create directories at those locations if permissions allow.
    4. If an attacker can control the `OUT` parameter (e.g., through a web interface or API that exposes this functionality), they can inject path traversal sequences.
    5. This can lead to creating directories outside the intended output directory, potentially anywhere on the filesystem where the `azslurm` command has write permissions.
    6. By manipulating the path, an attacker might be able to write cost reports to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting sensitive files or creating directories in protected areas.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary Directory Creation:** An attacker can create directories at any location on the filesystem where the Slurm scheduler process has write permissions.
    - **Potential Arbitrary File Write:** By carefully crafting the output path, an attacker might be able to write files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting sensitive system files or placing malicious content in web-accessible directories if the CycleCloud web server shares the same filesystem. This could lead to further compromise or information disclosure.
    - **Information Disclosure (Indirect):** While not direct information disclosure, writing files to unintended locations could be used to log sensitive information in world-readable locations or overwrite configuration files to alter system behavior for information gathering.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses `os.makedirs` on the user-provided output path without any sanitization or validation within the provided project files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation for the `-o OUT` parameter to ensure it is a safe path and does not contain path traversal sequences.
    - **Path Canonicalization:** Canonicalize the output path to resolve symbolic links and `..` components to a standard absolute path, and then validate that the resolved path is within an allowed directory.
    - **Restrict Output Path:** Enforce that the output directory is always within a predefined safe base directory. For example, always prepend a safe base path to the user-provided output path and validate the final path.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Slurm accounting must be enabled for the `azslurm cost` command to function.
    - The `azslurm cost` command functionality must be accessible to an attacker, either directly on the Slurm scheduler node or indirectly through a web interface or API that allows specifying the output directory.
    - The Slurm scheduler process must have write permissions to the target directories for successful exploitation.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/slurm/src/slurmcc/cli.py`
        ```python
        def cost_parser(self, parser: ArgumentParser) -> None:
            parser.add_argument("-o", "--out", required=True, help="Directory name for output CSV")

        def cost(self, config: Dict, start, end, out, fmt=None):
            """ ... """
            driver = cost.CostDriver(azcost, config)
            driver.run(start, end, out, fmt)
        ```
        - The `cost_parser` function defines the `-o` or `--out` argument, which is required and its value is passed to the `cost` function as `out`.
        - The `cost` function then creates a `CostDriver` instance and calls its `run` method, passing the `out` parameter.

    - **File:** `/code/slurm/src/slurmcc/cost.py`
        ```python
        class CostSlurm:
            def __init__(self, start:str, end: str, cluster: str, cache_root: str, fmt: str=None) -> None:
                """ ... """
                self.cache = f"{cache_root}/slurm"
                try:
                    os.makedirs(self.cache, 0o777, exist_ok=True)
                except OSError as e:
                    log.error("Unable to create cache directory {self.cache}")
                    log.error(e.strerror)
                    raise
                """ ... """

        class CostDriver:
            def __init__(self, azcost: azurecost, config: dict):
                """ ... """

            def run(self, start: datetime, end: datetime, out: str, fmt: str):
                """ ... """
                try:
                    os.makedirs(out, exist_ok=True) # Vulnerable line
                except OSError as e:
                    log.error(f"Cannot create output directory {out}")
                    raise
                jobs_csv = os.path.join(out, "jobs.csv")
                part_csv = os.path.join(out, "partition.csv")
                part_hourly = os.path.join(out, "partition_hourly.csv")
                """ ... """
        ```
        - In `CostDriver.run`, the `out` parameter, which is directly derived from user input via the `-o OUT` argument, is used in `os.makedirs(out, exist_ok=True)`.
        - There is no input validation or sanitization on the `out` variable before calling `os.makedirs`, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure Slurm accounting is enabled on the target Slurm cluster.
        - Access to the Slurm scheduler node as root or a user with permissions to run `azslurm cost`.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Log in to the Slurm scheduler node.
        - Execute the `azslurm cost` command with a path traversal payload for the `-o OUT` parameter:
          ```bash
          sudo /opt/azurehpc/slurm/venv/bin/azslurm cost -s $(date +%Y-%m-%d) -e $(date +%Y-%m-%d) -o "/tmp/../../../../tmp/test_dir_traversal"
          ```
        - Check if the directory `test_dir_traversal` is created in the `/tmp` directory (or another location outside the intended output directory if a different path is used).
          ```bash
          ls -ld /tmp/test_dir_traversal
          ```
        - To test potential file write, attempt to write to a protected directory (this might fail due to permissions, but confirms path traversal):
          ```bash
          sudo /opt/azurehpc/slurm/venv/bin/azslurm cost -s $(date +%Y-%m-%d) -e $(date +%Y-%m-%d) -o "/etc/cron.d/test_file_write"
          ```
        - Check for error messages and attempt to verify if any files were created in `/etc/cron.d/` (Note: writing to `/etc/cron.d/` will likely be restricted).
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The directory `test_dir_traversal` should be created in `/tmp`, confirming path traversal.
        - Attempting to write to `/etc/cron.d/` might result in a permission error but will still indicate that the path traversal is possible and the command attempted to operate outside the intended output location.
        - No errors related to path validation should be reported by `azslurm cost`.
