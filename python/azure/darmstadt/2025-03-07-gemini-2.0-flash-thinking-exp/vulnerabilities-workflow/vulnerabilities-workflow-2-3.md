### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `ContainerController.run()`
* Description:
    1. The `ContainerController.run()` method in `remote_controller.py` is designed to execute commands within a Docker container.
    2. The method takes a `command` string as input, which is intended to be the command executed inside the container.
    3. This `command` string is directly embedded into a larger shell command string that uses `docker exec`.
    4. Specifically, the code constructs a command like `docker exec --user root {docker_options} {self.name} {command}`.
    5. The user-provided `command` is appended to this string without any sanitization or escaping.
    6. An attacker can craft a malicious `command` string that includes shell metacharacters (like `&&`, `;`, `|`, `$()`, etc.) to inject arbitrary commands alongside the intended command.
    7. When `context.run()` is executed, the entire string, including the injected commands, is passed to the shell for execution within the Docker container.
    8. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands inside the container with root privileges, effectively bypassing the intended command and control flow.

* Impact:
    * **Critical Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands within the Docker container with root privileges.
    * **Container Compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the Docker container.
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive data stored within the container.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete critical data and configurations within the container.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Depending on the container's configuration and network access, attackers might be able to use the compromised container to pivot and attack other systems or resources accessible from within the container's network.
    * **Host System Compromise (Potentially):** In some misconfigured Docker environments or with specific container escapes, it might be possible to escalate the attack from the container to the host system.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The code directly uses string concatenation to build the command executed by the shell, without any input validation or sanitization of the `command` argument.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input Sanitization:** The most crucial missing mitigation is input sanitization for the `command` argument in the `ContainerController.run()` method. All user-provided input should be carefully validated and sanitized to remove or escape shell metacharacters before being used in shell commands.
    * **Parameterized Commands or Shell Escaping:** Instead of directly embedding the command string, consider using parameterized commands or proper shell escaping mechanisms provided by the underlying execution library (`invoke` or `fabric`) to prevent command injection.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly mitigating command injection, running containers with non-root users whenever possible can reduce the impact of such vulnerabilities. However, the code explicitly uses `--user root` in `docker run` and `docker exec`.
    * **Direct Docker API Usage:** A more robust solution would be to avoid using shell commands altogether and interact with the Docker daemon directly through the Docker SDK for Python. This would involve using functions within the `docker-py` library to execute commands within containers, which typically provides safer ways to execute commands without shell injection risks.

* Preconditions:
    * An attacker must have the ability to call the `run()` method of a `ContainerController` instance.
    * The `ContainerController` must be properly initialized with a container name and image, and the container must be started.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/darmstadt/remote_controller.py`
    2. **Class:** `ContainerController`
    3. **Method:** `run(self, command: str, pty: bool = False, **kwargs: Any)`
    4. **Line:**
       ```python
       return self.context.run(f"{docker_cmd} {command}", pty=pty, **kwargs)
       ```
    5. **Vulnerable Code:** The f-string `f"{docker_cmd} {command}"` directly concatenates the `docker_cmd` (which sets up the `docker exec` command) with the user-provided `command` string.
    6. **No Sanitization:** There is no input validation, sanitization, or escaping applied to the `command` variable before it is embedded in the shell command.
    7. **Command Injection Point:** This direct concatenation creates a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can insert malicious shell commands within the `command` argument, which will be executed by the shell within the Docker container.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Input: command] --> B(ContainerController.run());
        B --> C{f-string concatenation: f"{docker_cmd} {command}"};
        C --> D[invoke.context.run()];
        D --> E[Shell Execution within Container];
        E --> F[Compromised Container];
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure you have Docker installed and running. You also need to have the `darmstadt` library installed or be in a development environment where you can run the code.
    2. **Create Test Script:** Create a Python script (e.g., `test_command_injection.py`) with the following content:

       ```python
       from darmstadt.remote_controller import ContainerController
       import secrets

       test_uid = secrets.token_hex(8)
       container = ContainerController(f"vuln-test-{test_uid}", "alpine")
       container.start()

       try:
           # Malicious command injection payload:
           malicious_command = "sh -c 'echo vulnerable > /tmp/test.txt && cat /tmp/test.txt'"
           result = container.run(malicious_command, in_stream=False)
           print(f"Command Output: {result.stdout}")

           # Verify file creation:
           verify_command = "cat /tmp/test.txt"
           verify_result = container.run(verify_command, in_stream=False)
           print(f"Verification Output: {verify_result.stdout}")

           assert "vulnerable" in verify_result.stdout, "Command injection failed!"
           print("[SUCCESS] Command Injection Vulnerability Verified!")

       except Exception as e:
           print(f"[FAILURE] Test Failed: {e}")
           assert False, f"Test Failed: {e}" # Fail the test if exception occurs

       finally:
           container.remove()
       ```
    3. **Run Test Script:** Execute the Python script: `python test_command_injection.py`
    4. **Expected Result:**
        * The script should successfully execute without errors.
        * The output should contain:
            * `Command Output: vulnerable\n` (or similar, depending on shell output nuances)
            * `Verification Output: vulnerable\n`
            * `[SUCCESS] Command Injection Vulnerability Verified!`
        * The assertion `assert "vulnerable" in verify_result.stdout` should pass, confirming that the injected command `echo vulnerable > /tmp/test.txt` was successfully executed and created the file within the container, proving the command injection vulnerability.
    5. **Interpretation:** If the test script runs successfully and produces the expected output with "[SUCCESS] Command Injection Vulnerability Verified!", it confirms the presence of a command injection vulnerability in the `ContainerController.run()` method. This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands within the Docker container.
