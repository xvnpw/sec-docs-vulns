- Vulnerability Name: Integer Overflow in FP8 GEMM Scaling
- Description:
    1. The MS-AMP library utilizes FP8 data types for performance optimization in deep learning models.
    2. In the `Gemm.fp8_gemm` function, which performs General Matrix Multiplication in FP8 precision, a scaling factor is applied to the input tensors to map higher-precision values to the limited range of FP8.
    3. Source code analysis reveals that the scaling factor calculation involves exponentiation and multiplication, which, under specific conditions with crafted inputs, could lead to an integer overflow when converting scale factors to integer representations used in CUDA kernels for FP8 operations.
    4. An attacker could craft input tensors with extreme value ranges that, when processed by a deep learning model using MS-AMP, trigger the vulnerable `Gemm.fp8_gemm` operation.
    5. This integer overflow in scaling would result in incorrect scaling factors being applied during the FP8 GEMM computation.
    6. Consequently, the numerical computations within the GEMM operation would be flawed, leading to corrupted or invalid output tensors from the layer.
    7. These incorrect outputs propagate through the deep learning model, ultimately causing the model to produce incorrect predictions.
    8. For example, in a classification model, this could lead to misclassification, while in a language model, it might result in the generation of nonsensical or harmful text.
- Impact:
    - Incorrect Model Predictions: Exploiting this vulnerability leads to numerical inaccuracies in model computations, causing the model to generate wrong predictions.
    - Application-Level Security Breach: For applications relying on the accuracy of deep learning models (e.g., autonomous systems, medical diagnosis), incorrect predictions due to this numerical vulnerability can lead to serious application-level security breaches and potentially harmful outcomes.
    - Data Integrity Violation: The vulnerability can be exploited to manipulate the output of the deep learning model in a way that violates the integrity of the processed data, leading to untrustworthy results.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Codebase includes unit tests (e.g., `/code/tests/operators/test_gemm.py`) that verify the functional correctness of `Gemm.fp8_gemm`. However, these tests primarily focus on basic functionality and might not cover extreme value ranges or edge cases that could trigger integer overflows in scaling factor calculations.
    - The `ScalingMeta` class and related functions in `/code/common/tensor/meta.py` and `/code/common/tensor/tensor.py` manage scaling and amax values, but there is no explicit overflow check or handling in the `Gemm.fp8_gemm` implementation itself within the provided code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement checks to validate the input tensor ranges and potentially sanitize or clip extreme values before they are processed by `Gemm.fp8_gemm`. This could prevent the generation of excessively large scaling factors.
    - Integer Overflow Checks in `Gemm.fp8_gemm`: Add explicit checks within the CUDA kernel or C++ code of `Gemm.fp8_gemm` to detect potential integer overflows during scaling factor calculations. Implement error handling or fallback mechanisms if overflows are detected.
    - Numerical Stability Testing: Develop more comprehensive numerical stability test cases specifically for `Gemm.fp8_gemm` that cover a wider range of input values, including extreme values and edge cases, to identify and address potential overflow or precision issues. These tests should verify not only functional correctness but also the numerical robustness of the operation.
- Preconditions:
    - Deep learning model must utilize MS-AMP library for mixed precision training or inference.
    - The model architecture must involve matrix multiplications performed by `msamp.operators.gemm.Gemm.fp8_gemm`.
    - Threat actor needs to be able to craft or manipulate input data fed to the deep learning model to contain extreme value ranges that can trigger the overflow.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/msamp/operators/gemm/gemm.py`
    2. Function: `fp8_gemm`
    3. The code calculates scaling factors without explicit checks for potential integer overflows during the exponentiation or multiplication operations.
    4. Specifically, the following lines in `msamp/common/tensor/meta.py`:
        ```python
        @staticmethod
        @torch.jit.script
        def compute_scaling_factor(amax, scale, fp_max: float, margin: int):
            """A function to compute scaling factor."""
            exp = torch.floor(torch.log2(fp_max / amax)) - margin
            sf = torch.round(torch.pow(2, torch.abs(exp))) # Potential overflow here during exponentiation or multiplication
            sf = torch.where(amax > 0.0, sf, scale)
            sf = torch.where(torch.isfinite(amax), sf, scale)
            sf = torch.where(exp < 0, 1 / sf, sf)
            return sf
        ```
        - The line `sf = torch.round(torch.pow(2, torch.abs(exp)))` calculates the scaling factor using exponentiation. If `exp` is sufficiently large, `torch.pow(2, torch.abs(exp))` could result in a value that exceeds the maximum representable integer, leading to an overflow when `torch.round` converts it to an integer type used internally.
    5. The `Gemm.fp8_gemm` function then uses these potentially overflowed scaling factors in subsequent FP8 matrix multiplication, leading to incorrect numerical results.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a deep learning model that uses `msamp.nn.Linear` or any MS-AMP integrated module that utilizes `Gemm.fp8_gemm` internally. For example, the `Net` model from `/code/examples/mnist.py` or `/code/examples/cifar10_deepspeed.py` can be adapted.
    2. Craft a malicious input tensor with values designed to maximize the `amax` value during FP8 scaling. This can be achieved by creating a tensor with very large absolute values (e.g., values close to the maximum representable float32/float16).
    3. Run inference with the crafted input tensor through the MS-AMP enabled model.
    4. Observe the model's output prediction. Compare this prediction to the expected output if the model were run without MS-AMP or with correct numerical behavior.
    5. If the model with MS-AMP produces a significantly different or incorrect prediction compared to the baseline, and if this deviation can be attributed to numerical instability caused by integer overflow in scaling (e.g., by examining intermediate tensor values or profiling the execution), then the vulnerability is confirmed.
    6. Example test case code snippet (conceptual, needs adaptation to a runnable test):
    ```python
    import torch
    import msamp
    from msamp.nn import FP8Linear
    from msamp.common.dtype import Dtypes

    # Initialize model with MS-AMP
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(FP8Linear(10, 10)).cuda()
    model = msamp.initialize(model, None, opt_level="O1")[0]

    # Craft malicious input to trigger potential overflow
    malicious_input = torch.full((1, 10), 1e6, dtype=torch.float32).cuda() # Large values to maximize amax

    # Run inference with MS-AMP
    output_msamp = model(malicious_input)

    # Run inference without MS-AMP (baseline - assuming FP32/FP16 is more stable)
    model_baseline = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(10, 10).cuda()) # Baseline model
    model_baseline.load_state_dict(model.state_dict()) # Load weights from MS-AMP model
    output_baseline = model_baseline(malicious_input)

    # Compare outputs
    if not torch.allclose(output_msamp.float(), output_baseline, rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2): # Increased tolerance for FP8
        print("Vulnerability Found: MS-AMP output deviates significantly from baseline!")
        print("MS-AMP Output:", output_msamp)
        print("Baseline Output:", output_baseline)
    else:
        print("Test inconclusive: No significant deviation observed.")
    ```
    7. The success of this test case depends on the specific architecture of the model, the range of input values that can be controlled by an attacker, and the precision characteristics of the FP8 implementation in MS-AMP. It serves as a starting point and might require refinement to reliably trigger the vulnerability if it exists.
