### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Log Injection leading to Regex Evasion
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains the ability to inject arbitrary log entries into a log file that is being monitored by Toothcomb. This could be achieved through various means depending on the system architecture, such as exploiting a vulnerability in a logging mechanism or gaining unauthorized access to the logging system.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious log entry that is designed to resemble legitimate log data but contains malicious content or signifies a security breach.
    3. Simultaneously, the attacker ensures that this crafted log entry does not match any of the regular expressions defined in the user's Toothcomb specification file. This evasion is achieved by subtly altering the log message syntax, wording, or formatting while preserving the semantic meaning for a human reader but diverging from the regex patterns.
    4. Toothcomb processes the log file, applying the user-defined regular expressions to categorize log entries.
    5. Due to the crafted nature of the injected log entry, it fails to match any of the 'livewith' or 'monitor' regular expressions.
    6. Consequently, Toothcomb categorizes the injected log entry as 'unexplained' and includes it in the 'unexplained' report section.
    7. The security analyst or monitoring personnel, relying on Toothcomb's reports, may overlook the 'unexplained' section or consider these entries as benign anomalies, thus missing the malicious log entry and the underlying security issue it represents.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows malicious activities to go unnoticed during log analysis.
    - Critical security events can be miscategorized as 'unexplained' and potentially ignored by monitoring personnel.
    - This can lead to delayed incident response, prolonged security breaches, and potential data loss or system compromise as malicious actions are not promptly identified and addressed.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application relies entirely on the user-provided regular expressions for log categorization. There are no built-in mechanisms to prevent regex evasion or detect maliciously crafted log entries beyond the user-defined rules.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Guidance on Robust Regex Design:** Provide users with best practices and examples for writing more robust and comprehensive regular expressions that are less susceptible to evasion. This could include recommendations on handling variations in log formats, common evasion techniques to consider, and testing methodologies for regex effectiveness.
    - **Regular Expression Testing Tools:** Integrate or recommend tools that allow users to test their regular expressions against a diverse set of log samples, including potential evasion attempts, to ensure their specifications are effective.
    - **Anomaly Detection (Future Enhancement):** For a more advanced mitigation, consider incorporating anomaly detection techniques that go beyond simple regex matching. This could involve analyzing log patterns, frequencies, and deviations from normal behavior to identify suspicious entries even if they evade regex-based detection. However, this is a more complex feature and might be outside the scope of the current tool. For now, improving regex robustness guidance is the most pertinent mitigation.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to inject log entries into the log files that are processed by Toothcomb.
    - The user's comb specification must contain regular expressions that are not sufficiently comprehensive to cover all potential variations of malicious log entries, allowing for crafted evasion.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is located in the `src/toothcomb/comb.py` file, specifically within the `match_spec` and `unmatched_blocks` functions.
    - **`match_spec(text, spec)` function:** This function iterates through the user-defined regular expressions in the `spec` dictionary. For each regular expression, it uses `regex.search(text)` to check if the provided `text` (a log block) matches the regex. If a match is found, the function returns the corresponding label. If no regex matches, it returns `None`.

    ```python
    def match_spec(text, spec):
        """
        Match text against keyed re spec.

        :param text: text to check
        :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
        :return: matched key or None
        """
        for (label, re_list) in spec.items():
            for regex in re_list:
                if regex.search(text): # Vulnerability: Relies solely on regex.search for matching
                    return label
        return None
    ```

    - **`unmatched_blocks(blocks, spec)` function:** This function utilizes `match_spec` to identify blocks of log text that do not match any of the regular expressions in the `spec`. It iterates through the `blocks` and, for each block, calls `match_spec`. If `match_spec` returns `None` (no match), the block is considered "unmatched" and added to the `unmatched` list.

    ```python
    def unmatched_blocks(blocks, spec):
        """
        Return list of unmatched blocks.

        :param blocks: list of blocks of text to check
        :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
        :return: list of unmatched blocks
        """
        unmatched = []
        for block in blocks:
            if block and not match_spec(block, spec): # Relies on match_spec for determining unmatched blocks
                unmatched.append(block)
        return unmatched
    ```

    - **Vulnerability Trigger:** An attacker exploits this by injecting a log entry that is semantically similar to entries that *should* be monitored or considered 'livewith', but syntactically deviates enough to avoid triggering `regex.search` for all regexes defined in `spec`.  Because `match_spec` returns `None`, and consequently `unmatched_blocks` includes this block in its output, the malicious log entry ends up in the "unexplained" report, potentially being overlooked.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Comb Specification (e.g., `evasion_comb.yaml`):**
        ```yaml
        monitor:
          - label: Failed Login Attempt
            regexp:
              - "Failed login for user .* from .*"
        ```
        This specification is designed to monitor for failed login attempts using a simple regular expression.

    2. **Prepare a Log File with an Evasion Attempt (e.g., `evasion_log.txt`):**
        ```text
        [INFO] System started successfully.
        [ERROR] Failed login for user 'admin' from 192.168.1.100.
        [WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure.
        [INFO] System shutdown initiated.
        ```
        In this log file, the second line is a standard failed login attempt that *should* be caught by the regex. The third line is a crafted evasion attempt. It describes a similar event ("Unauthorized access attempt", "Login Failure") but uses different phrasing ("Unauthorized access attempt", "IP:", "Login Failure") to potentially evade the simple regex "Failed login for user .* from .*".

    3. **Run Toothcomb with the Comb Specification and Log File:**
        ```bash
        toothcomb evasion_comb.yaml evasion_log.txt
        ```

    4. **Analyze the Toothcomb Output:**
        The expected output should show that the standard "Failed login" entry is correctly categorized under 'monitor', but the crafted evasion attempt is categorized as 'unexplained'.

        ```text
        livewith
        ========

        monitor
        =======
        Failed Login Attempt: 1

        unexplained
        ===========
        [WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure.
        ```

    5. **Verification:**
        By examining the output, we can confirm that the crafted log entry "[WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure." is indeed listed under 'unexplained'. This demonstrates that the simple regex in `evasion_comb.yaml` was evaded, and a semantically relevant security event was not correctly categorized as 'monitor', proving the Log Injection leading to Regex Evasion vulnerability.
