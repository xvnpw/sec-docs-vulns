- Vulnerability Name: YAML Configuration Regular Expression Injection leading to Misclassification of Log Entries
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML configuration file.
    2. This YAML file contains regular expressions within the `livewith` and `monitor` sections.
    3. These regular expressions are designed to either:
        - Be overly specific and miss genuine error messages in the logs, causing critical errors to be categorized as "unexplained" and potentially overlooked.
        - Be overly broad or specifically target benign log entries, causing important security events or errors to be misclassified as "livewith" or "monitor" (known issues) and thus ignored.
    4. A user is tricked into using this malicious YAML configuration file with the `toothcomb` tool to analyze their logs.
    5. The `toothcomb` tool, using the attacker's malicious configuration, misclassifies or misses important log entries based on the attacker-controlled regular expressions.
    6. The user, relying on the tool's output, overlooks genuine issues within their logs because they are either miscategorized or not categorized at all.
- Impact:
    - Security events or critical errors in logs can be missed or misclassified.
    - Users may fail to identify and respond to real security incidents or system problems.
    - This can lead to undetected security breaches, system instability, or prolonged outages.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses regular expressions provided in the YAML configuration without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for regular expressions in the YAML configuration.
    - Documentation warning users about the risks of using untrusted YAML configuration files and the potential for misclassification based on regex definitions.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide or convince a user to use a maliciously crafted YAML configuration file with the `toothcomb` tool.
    - The user must run the `toothcomb` tool with the malicious YAML configuration against their log files.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/toothcomb/comb.py` - `Toothcomb.__init__(self, spec, text)`**:
        ```python
        class Toothcomb:
            """Toothcomb."""

            def __init__(self, spec, text):
                """
                Initialise.

                :param spec: comb specification dictionary
                :param text: text to be analysed
                """
                self._explained = {}
                self._livewith = {}
                self._monitor = {}
                for live_spec in spec.get("livewith"):
                    label = live_spec.get("label", "other")
                    if label not in self._livewith.keys():
                        self._livewith[label] = []
                    if label not in self._explained.keys():
                        self._explained[label] = []
                    for exp in live_spec.get("regexp", []):
                        self._livewith[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                        self._explained[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                for monitor_spec in spec.get("monitor"):
                    label = monitor_spec.get("label", "other")
                    if label not in self._monitor.keys():
                        self._monitor[label] = []
                    if label not in self._explained.keys():
                        self._explained[label] = []
                    for exp in monitor_spec.get("regexp", []):
                        self._monitor[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                        self._explained[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                self._blocksplit = spec.get("blocksplit", "\n")
                self._blocks = text.split(self._blocksplit)
        ```
        - The `Toothcomb` class initializes by processing the `spec` dictionary, which is loaded from the YAML file in `toothcomb.scripts.toothcomb.py`.
        - It iterates through the `livewith` and `monitor` sections of the spec.
        - For each regular expression string `exp` found under the `regexp` key, it directly compiles it using `re.compile(exp)`.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: There is no validation or sanitization of the regular expression strings before compilation. This means any regex provided in the YAML will be used as is.

    2. **File: `/code/src/toothcomb/comb.py` - `match_spec(text, spec)`**:
        ```python
        def match_spec(text, spec):
            """
            Match text against keyed re spec.

            :param text: text to check
            :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
            :return: matched key or None
            """
            for (label, re_list) in spec.items():
                for regex in re_list: # [!] Using compiled regex from spec
                    if regex.search(text): # [!] Executing regex search
                        return label
            return None
        ```
        - The `match_spec` function takes the compiled regular expressions from the `spec` (created from the YAML) and uses `regex.search(text)` to match them against the input text.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: The behavior of `toothcomb` is directly controlled by the regular expressions defined in the YAML configuration. Malicious regexes will be executed without restriction.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious YAML configuration file (e.g., `malicious_comb.yaml`):**
        ```yaml
        livewith:
          - label: MissedError
            regexp:
              - 'ThisErrorWillNotBeReportedBecauseRegexIsTooSpecific'
        monitor:
          - label: BenignEventMisclassified
            regexp:
              - '.*Benign Log Message.*'
        ```
        This malicious configuration has two parts:
            - `MissedError`:  A regex designed to be too specific and unlikely to match real errors, aiming to make the tool miss actual "unexplained" errors by categorizing nothing as "livewith" for this label.
            - `BenignEventMisclassified`: A broad regex `'.*Benign Log Message.*'` that will match any line containing "Benign Log Message", misclassifying these benign messages as "monitor" events.

    2. **Prepare a sample log file (e.g., `sample.log`):**
        ```text
        This is a benign log message.
        This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
        Another benign log message.
        ```

    3. **Run `toothcomb` with the malicious YAML configuration and the sample log file:**
        ```bash
        toothcomb malicious_comb.yaml sample.log
        ```

    4. **Expected Output (without `-a` flag, default report):**
        ```text
        livewith
        ========
        MissedError: 0

        monitor
        =======
        BenignEventMisclassified: 2

        unexplained
        ===========
        This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
        ```
        - **Verification**:
            - The "Benign Log Message" entries are correctly misclassified as "monitor".
            - The "critical error message" is categorized as "unexplained". However, if the attacker wanted to completely hide errors, they could craft regexes in "livewith" or "monitor" to aggressively match and categorize log lines, effectively masking "unexplained" entries from the report if all lines are matched.
            - If the attacker provides very narrow regexes in `livewith` and `monitor`, they can effectively cause the tool to report almost everything as "unexplained", even known errors, defeating the purpose of categorization.

    5. **Run `toothcomb` with the malicious YAML configuration and the sample log file with annotate flag:**
        ```bash
        toothcomb -a malicious_comb.yaml sample.log
        ```

    6. **Expected Output (with `-a` flag, annotated report):**
        ```text

          This is a benign log message.
        M   Another benign log message.

          This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
        ```
        - **Verification**:
            - "Benign log message" lines are annotated with 'M' (monitor), confirming misclassification.
            - "critical error message" line is annotated with '  ' (unexplained).

This test case demonstrates that a malicious YAML configuration can indeed influence the classification of log entries, leading to misrepresentation of the log analysis results and potentially causing users to overlook important issues.
