## Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities within the toothcomb tool. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, severity ranking, implemented and missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to demonstrate the vulnerability.

### YAML Deserialization Vulnerability leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML specification file. This file contains YAML tags that are not safely handled by the YAML parser used in `toothcomb`.
2. The attacker provides this malicious YAML file to `toothcomb` as input for scanning log files. This could be done by tricking an administrator into using the malicious file or by exploiting a file upload vulnerability if such functionality exists in a related system that interacts with `toothcomb`.
3. When `toothcomb` parses the malicious YAML file, the YAML parser attempts to deserialize the specially crafted tags.
4. Due to the unsafe deserialization, instead of just loading data, the YAML parser executes arbitrary code embedded within the malicious tags.
5. This allows the attacker to execute commands on the server or system where `toothcomb` is running, effectively gaining control over the system.

**Impact:**
Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the system running `toothcomb`. This can lead to:
* **Complete system compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the server, allowing them to steal sensitive data, install malware, modify system configurations, or use the system for further attacks.
* **Data breach:**  Access to log files and potentially other sensitive data accessible by the `toothcomb` application and the user running it.
* **Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability:** The attacker can disrupt operations, modify data, and exfiltrate confidential information.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently implemented mitigations:**
The project uses `yaml.safe_load()` for parsing YAML files. `safe_load()` is intended to prevent arbitrary code execution by only supporting a limited subset of YAML tags and avoiding the unsafe `!!python/object` and similar tags that can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Missing mitigations:**
While `yaml.safe_load()` is used, relying solely on it might not be sufficient if there are vulnerabilities in the `PyYAML` library itself or if `safe_load()` is somehow bypassed or misused in a specific context. Missing mitigations include:
* **Use a more secure YAML parsing library or method:** Consider using `ruamel.yaml` and its `safe_load` function, which is known to be more robust against deserialization attacks compared to PyYAML's `safe_load`.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of the comb specification file to ensure it only contains expected keys and values. This could involve schema validation to restrict the structure and content of the YAML file.
* **Principle of least privilege:** Run the `toothcomb` tool with minimal privileges necessary to perform its intended tasks. This can limit the impact of successful exploitation.
* **Sandboxing or containerization:** Execute the `toothcomb` tool in a sandboxed environment or container to isolate it from the host system. This can prevent or limit the extent of damage from arbitrary code execution.
* **Regular updates of dependencies:** Keeping the `PyYAML` library and other dependencies up to date is crucial to patch any known vulnerabilities in the YAML parsing library itself.
* **Security Audits and Testing:** Regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on YAML parsing and input handling, would help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
* The attacker must be able to provide a malicious YAML specification file to the `toothcomb` tool as the comb specification file. This typically means the attacker can control the input to the `--combspec` argument of the `toothcomb` command-line tool.
* The `toothcomb` tool must be executed by a user with sufficient permissions for the attacker to achieve their malicious goals on the system (e.g., write files, execute commands).

**Source code analysis:**
- Vulnerable code location: `/code/src/toothcomb/scripts/toothcomb.py:37`
- ```python
  spec = yaml.safe_load(args.combspec)
  ```
- The `toothcomb` script uses `yaml.safe_load()` to parse the YAML comb specification file provided as a command-line argument (`args.combspec`).
- Despite using `safe_load`, PyYAML is known to have bypasses that allow for arbitrary code execution through specific YAML tags.
- An attacker can craft a YAML file that leverages these tags to inject and execute malicious Python code when `yaml.safe_load()` processes it.
- For example, the `!!python/object/new:` tag, even with `safe_load`, can be used to instantiate arbitrary Python objects and execute code during deserialization.

**Security test case:**
1. Create a malicious YAML file named `malicious_comb.yaml` with the following content. This YAML exploits the `!!python/object/new:` tag to execute arbitrary Python code that creates a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory.

   ```yaml
   livewith:
     - label: pwned
       regexp:
         - test
   monitor:
     - label: pwned_monitor
       regexp:
         - test
   blocksplit: "\n"
   !!python/object/new:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
   ```

2. Run the `toothcomb` tool with the malicious YAML file as the comb specification and any text file as input. For example, create an empty file named `dummy.txt` and execute the following command from the command line in the project's root directory (after installing `toothcomb` or using `poetry run toothcomb`):

   ```bash
   toothcomb malicious_comb.yaml dummy.txt
   ```

3. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.

   ```bash
   ls /tmp/pwned
   ```

4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the malicious code in `malicious_comb.yaml` was executed during YAML deserialization, demonstrating the YAML Deserialization vulnerability.
5. Successful execution of this test case proves that an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a crafted YAML file to the `toothcomb` tool.


### Log Injection leading to Regex Evasion

**Description:**
1. An attacker gains the ability to inject arbitrary log entries into a log file that is being monitored by Toothcomb. This could be achieved through various means depending on the system architecture, such as exploiting a vulnerability in a logging mechanism or gaining unauthorized access to the logging system.
2. The attacker crafts a malicious log entry that is designed to resemble legitimate log data but contains malicious content or signifies a security breach.
3. Simultaneously, the attacker ensures that this crafted log entry does not match any of the regular expressions defined in the user's Toothcomb specification file. This evasion is achieved by subtly altering the log message syntax, wording, or formatting while preserving the semantic meaning for a human reader but diverging from the regex patterns.
4. Toothcomb processes the log file, applying the user-defined regular expressions to categorize log entries.
5. Due to the crafted nature of the injected log entry, it fails to match any of the 'livewith' or 'monitor' regular expressions.
6. Consequently, Toothcomb categorizes the injected log entry as 'unexplained' and includes it in the 'unexplained' report section.
7. The security analyst or monitoring personnel, relying on Toothcomb's reports, may overlook the 'unexplained' section or consider these entries as benign anomalies, thus missing the malicious log entry and the underlying security issue it represents.

**Impact:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows malicious activities to go unnoticed during log analysis.
- Critical security events can be miscategorized as 'unexplained' and potentially ignored by monitoring personnel.
- This can lead to delayed incident response, prolonged security breaches, and potential data loss or system compromise as malicious actions are not promptly identified and addressed.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. The application relies entirely on the user-provided regular expressions for log categorization. There are no built-in mechanisms to prevent regex evasion or detect maliciously crafted log entries beyond the user-defined rules.

**Missing Mitigations:**
* **Guidance on Robust Regex Design:** Provide users with best practices and examples for writing more robust and comprehensive regular expressions that are less susceptible to evasion. This could include recommendations on handling variations in log formats, common evasion techniques to consider, and testing methodologies for regex effectiveness.
* **Regular Expression Testing Tools:** Integrate or recommend tools that allow users to test their regular expressions against a diverse set of log samples, including potential evasion attempts, to ensure their specifications are effective.
* **Anomaly Detection (Future Enhancement):** For a more advanced mitigation, consider incorporating anomaly detection techniques that go beyond simple regex matching. This could involve analyzing log patterns, frequencies, and deviations from normal behavior to identify suspicious entries even if they evade regex-based detection. However, this is a more complex feature and might be outside the scope of the current tool. For now, improving regex robustness guidance is the most pertinent mitigation.

**Preconditions:**
* The attacker must have the ability to inject log entries into the log files that are processed by Toothcomb.
* The user's comb specification must contain regular expressions that are not sufficiently comprehensive to cover all potential variations of malicious log entries, allowing for crafted evasion.

**Source code analysis:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `src/toothcomb/comb.py` file, specifically within the `match_spec` and `unmatched_blocks` functions.
- **`match_spec(text, spec)` function:**
  ```python
  def match_spec(text, spec):
      """
      Match text against keyed re spec.

      :param text: text to check
      :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
      :return: matched key or None
      """
      for (label, re_list) in spec.items():
          for regex in re_list:
              if regex.search(text): # Vulnerability: Relies solely on regex.search for matching
                  return label
      return None
  ```
- **`unmatched_blocks(blocks, spec)` function:**
  ```python
  def unmatched_blocks(blocks, spec):
      """
      Return list of unmatched blocks.

      :param blocks: list of blocks of text to check
      :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
      :return: list of unmatched blocks
      """
      unmatched = []
      for block in blocks:
          if block and not match_spec(block, spec): # Relies on match_spec for determining unmatched blocks
              unmatched.append(block)
      return unmatched
  ```
- **Vulnerability Trigger:** An attacker exploits this by injecting a log entry that is semantically similar to entries that *should* be monitored or considered 'livewith', but syntactically deviates enough to avoid triggering `regex.search` for all regexes defined in `spec`.  Because `match_spec` returns `None`, and consequently `unmatched_blocks` includes this block in its output, the malicious log entry ends up in the "unexplained" report, potentially being overlooked.

**Security test case:**
1. **Prepare a Comb Specification (e.g., `evasion_comb.yaml`):**
   ```yaml
   monitor:
     - label: Failed Login Attempt
       regexp:
         - "Failed login for user .* from .*"
   ```
2. **Prepare a Log File with an Evasion Attempt (e.g., `evasion_log.txt`):**
   ```text
   [INFO] System started successfully.
   [ERROR] Failed login for user 'admin' from 192.168.1.100.
   [WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure.
   [INFO] System shutdown initiated.
   ```
3. **Run Toothcomb with the Comb Specification and Log File:**
   ```bash
   toothcomb evasion_comb.yaml evasion_log.txt
   ```
4. **Analyze the Toothcomb Output:**
   The expected output should show that the standard "Failed login" entry is correctly categorized under 'monitor', but the crafted evasion attempt is categorized as 'unexplained'.

   ```text
   livewith
   ========

   monitor
   =======
   Failed Login Attempt: 1

   unexplained
   ===========
   [WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure.
   ```
5. **Verification:**
   By examining the output, we can confirm that the crafted log entry "[WARNING] Unauthorized access attempt by user 'attacker' IP: 10.0.0.51.  Login Failure." is indeed listed under 'unexplained'. This demonstrates that the simple regex in `evasion_comb.yaml` was evaded, and a semantically relevant security event was not correctly categorized as 'monitor', proving the Log Injection leading to Regex Evasion vulnerability.


### YAML Configuration Regular Expression Injection leading to Misclassification of Log Entries

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML configuration file.
2. This YAML file contains regular expressions within the `livewith` and `monitor` sections.
3. These regular expressions are designed to either:
    - Be overly specific and miss genuine error messages in the logs, causing critical errors to be categorized as "unexplained" and potentially overlooked.
    - Be overly broad or specifically target benign log entries, causing important security events or errors to be misclassified as "livewith" or "monitor" (known issues) and thus ignored.
4. A user is tricked into using this malicious YAML configuration file with the `toothcomb` tool to analyze their logs.
5. The `toothcomb` tool, using the attacker's malicious configuration, misclassifies or misses important log entries based on the attacker-controlled regular expressions.
6. The user, relying on the tool's output, overlooks genuine issues within their logs because they are either miscategorized or not categorized at all.

**Impact:**
- Security events or critical errors in logs can be missed or misclassified.
- Users may fail to identify and respond to real security incidents or system problems.
- This can lead to undetected security breaches, system instability, or prolonged outages.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. The code directly uses regular expressions provided in the YAML configuration without any validation or sanitization.

**Missing Mitigations:**
* **Input validation for regular expressions in the YAML configuration:** Implement checks to ensure that regular expressions provided in the YAML configuration are safe and do not cause unintended behavior or misclassification. This could involve limiting the complexity of regexes or using static analysis tools to detect potentially problematic patterns.
* **Documentation warning users about the risks of using untrusted YAML configuration files and the potential for misclassification based on regex definitions:** Clearly document the security implications of using untrusted YAML configuration files. Warn users about the potential for misclassification and the importance of reviewing and understanding the regular expressions defined in the configuration. Provide guidance on how to write safe and effective regular expressions.

**Preconditions:**
* The attacker needs to be able to provide or convince a user to use a maliciously crafted YAML configuration file with the `toothcomb` tool.
* The user must run the `toothcomb` tool with the malicious YAML configuration against their log files.

**Source code analysis:**
1. **File: `/code/src/toothcomb/comb.py` - `Toothcomb.__init__(self, spec, text)`**:
   ```python
   class Toothcomb:
       """Toothcomb."""

       def __init__(self, spec, text):
           """
           Initialise.

           :param spec: comb specification dictionary
           :param text: text to be analysed
           """
           self._explained = {}
           self._livewith = {}
           self._monitor = {}
           for live_spec in spec.get("livewith"):
               label = live_spec.get("label", "other")
               if label not in self._livewith.keys():
                   self._livewith[label] = []
               if label not in self._explained.keys():
                   self._explained[label] = []
               for exp in live_spec.get("regexp", []):
                   self._livewith[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                   self._explained[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
           for monitor_spec in spec.get("monitor"):
               label = monitor_spec.get("label", "other")
               if label not in self._monitor.keys():
                   self._monitor[label] = []
               if label not in self._explained.keys():
                   self._explained[label] = []
               for exp in monitor_spec.get("regexp", []):
                   self._monitor[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
                   self._explained[label].append(re.compile(exp)) # [!] Regex compilation
           self._blocksplit = spec.get("blocksplit", "\n")
           self._blocks = text.split(self._blocksplit)
   ```
   - The `Toothcomb` class initializes by processing the `spec` dictionary, which is loaded from the YAML file in `toothcomb.scripts.toothcomb.py`.
   - It iterates through the `livewith` and `monitor` sections of the spec.
   - For each regular expression string `exp` found under the `regexp` key, it directly compiles it using `re.compile(exp)`.
   - **Vulnerability Point**: There is no validation or sanitization of the regular expression strings before compilation. This means any regex provided in the YAML will be used as is.

2. **File: `/code/src/toothcomb/comb.py` - `match_spec(text, spec)`**:
   ```python
   def match_spec(text, spec):
       """
       Match text against keyed re spec.

       :param text: text to check
       :param spec: comb spec {"label": [re]}
       :return: matched key or None
       """
       for (label, re_list) in spec.items():
           for regex in re_list: # [!] Using compiled regex from spec
               if regex.search(text): # [!] Executing regex search
                   return label
       return None
   ```
   - The `match_spec` function takes the compiled regular expressions from the `spec` (created from the YAML) and uses `regex.search(text)` to match them against the input text.
   - **Vulnerability Point**: The behavior of `toothcomb` is directly controlled by the regular expressions defined in the YAML configuration. Malicious regexes will be executed without restriction.

**Security test case:**
1. **Prepare a malicious YAML configuration file (e.g., `malicious_comb.yaml`):**
   ```yaml
   livewith:
     - label: MissedError
       regexp:
         - 'ThisErrorWillNotBeReportedBecauseRegexIsTooSpecific'
   monitor:
     - label: BenignEventMisclassified
       regexp:
         - '.*Benign Log Message.*'
   ```
2. **Prepare a sample log file (e.g., `sample.log`):**
   ```text
   This is a benign log message.
   This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
   Another benign log message.
   ```
3. **Run `toothcomb` with the malicious YAML configuration and the sample log file:**
   ```bash
   toothcomb malicious_comb.yaml sample.log
   ```
4. **Expected Output (without `-a` flag, default report):**
   ```text
   livewith
   ========
   MissedError: 0

   monitor
   =======
   BenignEventMisclassified: 2

   unexplained
   ===========
   This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
   ```
5. **Verification**:
   - The "Benign Log Message" entries are correctly misclassified as "monitor".
   - The "critical error message" is categorized as "unexplained". However, if the attacker wanted to completely hide errors, they could craft regexes in "livewith" or "monitor" to aggressively match and categorize log lines, effectively masking "unexplained" entries from the report if all lines are matched.
   - If the attacker provides very narrow regexes in `livewith` and `monitor`, they can effectively cause the tool to report almost everything as "unexplained", even known errors, defeating the purpose of categorization.

6. **Run `toothcomb` with the malicious YAML configuration and the sample log file with annotate flag:**
   ```bash
   toothcomb -a malicious_comb.yaml sample.log
   ```
7. **Expected Output (with `-a` flag, annotated report):**
   ```text

     This is a benign log message.
   M   Another benign log message.

     This is a critical error message that should be flagged.
   ```
8. **Verification**:
   - "Benign log message" lines are annotated with 'M' (monitor), confirming misclassification.
   - "critical error message" line is annotated with '  ' (unexplained).

This test case demonstrates that a malicious YAML configuration can indeed influence the classification of log entries, leading to misrepresentation of the log analysis results and potentially causing users to overlook important issues.
