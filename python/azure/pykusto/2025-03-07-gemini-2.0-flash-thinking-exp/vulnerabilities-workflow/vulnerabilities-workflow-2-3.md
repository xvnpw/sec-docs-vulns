### Vulnerability List for PyKusto Project

* Vulnerability Name: Python User-Defined Function (UDF) Code Injection
* Description:
    1. The `_stringify_python_func` function in `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py` converts a Python function object into a string representation of Python code.
    2. This string is then embedded directly into a Kusto query when using the `evaluate_udf` function.
    3. If an attacker could influence the Python function object that is passed to `evaluate_udf`, they could inject arbitrary Python code into the Kusto query.
    4. While direct external control over the function object is not exposed through the PyKusto API, if an application using PyKusto constructs UDFs based on external or untrusted input (e.g., reading function code from a file specified by a user, or dynamically generating function code based on user-provided parameters), a code injection vulnerability could arise.
    5. When the query with the injected UDF is executed against Azure Data Explorer, the injected Python code will be executed within the context of the Kusto Python plugin, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data access, or manipulation.

* Impact:
    An attacker could execute arbitrary Python code within the Azure Data Explorer's Python plugin sandbox. This could lead to:
    1. Unauthorized data access: The attacker could bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive information from the Kusto database.
    2. Data manipulation: The attacker could modify or delete data within the Kusto database, leading to data integrity issues.
    3. Lateral movement: In a compromised environment, the attacker might be able to leverage code execution within the Kusto plugin to pivot to other parts of the Azure environment, depending on the plugin's permissions and network access.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    There are no specific mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent code injection through the `_stringify_python_func` function. The code focuses on functionality rather than input sanitization or validation for security purposes in this area.

* Missing Mitigations:
    1. Input validation and sanitization: If UDF definitions are ever constructed based on external input, rigorous validation and sanitization of the function code would be necessary before passing it to `_stringify_python_func`. However, the current PyKusto API does not expose a direct mechanism for users to provide raw function code strings, so this is more of a concern for applications *using* PyKusto if they choose to build such functionality.
    2. Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the Kusto cluster and the permissions granted to the identity running PyKusto queries follow the principle of least privilege. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if code injection is successful. However, this is a general security best practice and not a specific mitigation within PyKusto itself.

* Preconditions:
    1. An application using PyKusto must allow for dynamic construction of Python UDFs based on potentially untrusted or externally influenced input.
    2. The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the Python function that gets stringified and sent to Kusto.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py`
    2. **Function:** `_stringify_python_func(func: FunctionType)`
    3. **Code:**
    ```python
    from types import FunctionType


    def _stringify_python_func(func: FunctionType):
        return """from types import CodeType\\ncode=CodeType({},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{})\\nexec(code)\\n""".format(
            func.__code__.co_argcount,
            func.__code__.co_kwonlyargcount,
            func.__code__.co_nlocals,
            func.__code__.co_stacksize,
            func.__code__.co_flags,
            func.__code__.co_code,
            func.__code__.co_consts,
            func.__code__.co_names,
            func.__code__.co_varnames,
            "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_filename),
            "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_name),
            func.__code__.co_firstlineno,
            func.__code__.co_lnotab,
            func.__code__.co_freevars,
            func.__code__.co_cellvars
        ).replace("\\x", "\\\\x")
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Point:** The function takes a Python `FunctionType` object and extracts various code attributes like `co_code`, `co_consts`, `co_names`, etc. These attributes are then directly formatted into a string that constructs Python code using `CodeType` and `exec(code)`.
    5. **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can somehow manipulate the attributes of the `func` object (which is not directly through PyKusto API but possible in a broader application context), they can inject arbitrary code into the string. This string is then sent to Kusto as part of the `evaluate python(...)` query. When Kusto executes this query, the `exec(code)` part will run the attacker's injected code within the Kusto Python plugin environment.
    6. **Visualization:**

    ```
    [Attacker Input (indirectly through application)] --> Manipulated Function Object --> _stringify_python_func() --> Malicious Python Code String --> Embedded in Kusto Query (evaluate python(...)) --> Azure Data Explorer (Kusto Python Plugin execution) --> Vulnerability Triggered (Code Injection)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** You will need a PyKusto client connected to a test Kusto cluster or a mock environment that can execute queries with the `evaluate python` plugin. For a real test, ensure you have appropriate permissions to execute Python plugins in your test Kusto cluster.
    2. **Craft Malicious Function:** Define a Python function with malicious code. For example, a function that attempts to read environment variables or access other resources (in a real-world scenario, more damaging actions could be attempted). For testing, a simple example is to try to write to a file within the sandbox (though file system access might be restricted in the Kusto plugin). A less risky test is to simply try to return a string that indicates successful code injection.
    3. **Example Malicious Function (for testing - be cautious in production):**
    ```python
    def malicious_func():
        import os
        return "INJECTED: " + os.environ.get("PATH", "FAILED_TO_GET_PATH")
    ```
    4. **Execute `evaluate_udf` with Malicious Function:** Use PyKusto's `evaluate_udf` to execute a query with the `malicious_func`.
    ```python
    from pykusto import PyKustoClient, Query, column_generator as col, Functions as f, _KustoType

    # Assume 'client' is your PyKustoClient instance
    table = client.database("Samples").table("StormEvents")

    def malicious_func():
        import os
        return "INJECTED: " + os.environ.get("PATH", "FAILED_TO_GET_PATH")

    query_with_injection = Query(table).take(1) # Simple query to add the UDF to
    query_with_udf = query_with_injection.evaluate_udf(malicious_func, injected_code_result=_KustoType.STRING) # Capture output in 'injected_code_result' column

    df_with_injection = query_with_udf.to_dataframe()
    print(df_with_injection['injected_code_result']) # Check if 'INJECTED:' is in the output, indicating code execution
    ```
    5. **Verify Code Execution:** Examine the results of the query execution. If the function `malicious_func`'s code was executed, you should see the string "INJECTED: ..." in the output column `injected_code_result`. This confirms the code injection vulnerability. In a real attack scenario, a successful exploit would not be as easily visible in the output but could have side effects like data exfiltration or modification.

This vulnerability highlights a risk associated with dynamic code generation, especially when user-provided data influences the code being generated. While PyKusto itself does not directly expose an API to inject malicious function code through *input*, applications built on top of PyKusto need to be extremely careful if they dynamically construct UDFs based on external or untrusted sources.
