### Vulnerabilities Found

#### 1. KQL Injection via User-Defined Function (UDF)

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker can craft a Python function containing malicious Kusto Query Language (KQL) code.
    2.  This malicious function, when provided to `pykusto` for User-Defined Function (UDF) execution, is stringified using `_stringify_python_func` in `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py`.
    3.  The stringified function is then embedded directly into a KQL query string that is sent to the Azure Data Explorer (ADX) service for execution via the `evaluate python` plugin.
    4.  Due to insecure stringification, the attacker's malicious KQL code within the Python function is executed by ADX as part of the query, leading to Kusto query injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** An attacker can execute arbitrary KQL queries within the context of the ADX database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, data manipulation, or even denial of service depending on the permissions of the identity used by `pykusto` to connect to ADX.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly stringifies and injects the Python function into the KQL query without any sanitization or validation.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  The `pykusto` library should sanitize or validate the input Python function to prevent the injection of malicious KQL code. This is extremely difficult to achieve reliably for arbitrary code.
    *   **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Ideally, UDF execution should be sandboxed or isolated to prevent malicious code from affecting the wider ADX environment. However, this is a feature that would need to be implemented by the ADX service itself, not just the SDK.
    *   **Discourage UDF usage for untrusted inputs:** Documentation should strongly discourage the use of UDFs with untrusted or user-controlled Python functions and highlight the severe security risks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The application using `pykusto` must allow users to define or provide Python functions that are then executed as UDFs via `pykusto`'s `evaluate_udf` functionality.
    *   The attacker must be able to provide a Python function that contains malicious KQL code.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **File: `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py`**
        ```python
        from types import FunctionType


        def _stringify_python_func(func: FunctionType):
            return """from types import CodeType\\ncode=CodeType({},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{})\\nexec(code)\\n""".format(
                func.__code__.co_argcount,
                func.__code__.co_kwonlyargcount,
                func.__code__.co_nlocals,
                func.__code__.co_stacksize,
                func.__code__.co_flags,
                func.__code__.co_code,
                func.__code__.co_consts,
                func.__code__.co_names,
                func.__code__.co_varnames,
                "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_filename),
                "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_name),
                func.__code__.co_firstlineno,
                func.__code__.co_lnotab,
                func.__code__.co_freevars,
                func.__code__.co_cellvars
            ).replace("\\x", "\\\\x")
        ```
        This function `_stringify_python_func` takes a Python function (`func`) and converts its bytecode into a string representation of Python code that, when executed in Kusto's Python plugin, reconstructs and executes the original function. The key vulnerability lies in the fact that the *content* of the function is taken directly from the `func` object's code attributes (`__code__`) and stringified without any inspection or sanitization.

    2.  **File: `/code/pykusto/_src/query.py`**
        ```python
        class Query:
            # ...
            def evaluate_udf(
                    self, udf: FunctionType, extend: bool = True, distribution: Distribution = None, **type_specs: _KustoType
            ) -> '_EvaluateQuery':
                """
                https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/pythonplugin
                """
                return _EvaluateQuery(
                    self, 'python',
                    AnyExpression(KQL(f'typeof({("*, " if extend else "") + ", ".join(field_name + ":" + kusto_type.primary_name for field_name, kusto_type in type_specs.items())})')),
                    _stringify_python_func(udf), # Vulnerable function is used here
                    distribution=distribution
                )
        ```
        The `evaluate_udf` function in the `Query` class uses `_stringify_python_func` to convert the user-provided `udf` function into a string. This string is then directly embedded into the KQL query as an argument to the `python` plugin.

    3.  **Visualization:**

        ```
        User Input (Malicious Python Function) --> _stringify_python_func() --> Stringified Python Code with potentially malicious KQL --> KQL Query ("evaluate python(...)") --> Azure Data Explorer --> Malicious KQL Execution
        ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Access to a pykusto project instance that allows defining and executing UDFs.
        *   Permissions to execute queries against an ADX database using pykusto.

    2.  **Steps:**
        *   Craft a malicious Python function that, when stringified and executed in ADX via `evaluate python`, will perform a Kusto query injection. For example, a function that appends `; getdatabase().Table.ToList() //` to the end of a seemingly benign query within the UDF.
        *   In your pykusto application code, use `evaluate_udf` to execute this malicious function. For example:
            ```python
            from pykusto import PyKustoClient, Query, Functions as f
            from datetime import timedelta

            client = PyKustoClient("https://<your_cluster>.kusto.windows.net") # Replace with your cluster
            db = client.database("<your_database>") # Replace with your database
            table = db.table("<your_table>") # Replace with your table

            def malicious_udf(df):
                malicious_kql = ";StormEvents | take 10 //"  # Example malicious KQL - data exfiltration
                exec_code = f"""
                from pykusto import Query
                malicious_query = "{malicious_kql}"
                q = Query(table) # Using 'table' from outer scope, might need adjustment based on your setup
                exec(malicious_query)
                """
                exec(exec_code)
                return df

            query_result_df = Query(table).take(5).evaluate_udf(malicious_udf, table_name="StormEvents").to_dataframe()
            print(query_result_df)
            ```
        *   Run the pykusto application.

    3.  **Expected Result:**
        *   The malicious KQL code injected through the UDF will be executed by ADX. In the example above, it would likely execute `StormEvents | take 10` in addition to the intended query. The output might contain data from the `StormEvents` table, demonstrating successful injection and potential data exfiltration.
        *   Observe the KQL query logs in ADX to confirm the execution of injected commands.

    4.  **Success Condition:**
        *   If the test successfully executes the injected KQL code (e.g., retrieves data from a table that should not be accessible under normal circumstances or performs unintended data manipulation), the vulnerability is confirmed.


#### 2. Kusto Query Injection via String Literal in `split` Function

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker can control the `delimiter` argument of the `split` function, which is used to construct a Kusto query.
    2. The `split` function in `_StringExpression` in `expressions.py` directly embeds the `delimiter` into the Kusto query string without proper sanitization.
    3. By providing a malicious string as `delimiter`, an attacker can inject arbitrary Kusto query language into the generated query.
    4. For example, an attacker could set `delimiter` to `');injection_code//` to inject `injection_code` into the Kusto query.
    5. When `pykusto` executes this query against Azure Data Explorer, the injected Kusto code will be executed, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** An attacker can execute arbitrary Kusto queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or denial of service within the Azure Data Explorer environment.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly incorporates the delimiter string into the Kusto query without any sanitization or validation.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization or validation for the `delimiter` argument in the `split` function to prevent injection of malicious Kusto syntax.
    *   Parameterization of the Kusto query to separate code from data, preventing injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The application using `pykusto` must allow user-controlled input to be passed as the `delimiter` argument to the `split` function of a `_StringExpression`.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/pykusto/_src/expressions.py`**
    2. **Class: `_StringExpression`**
    3. **Function: `split(self, delimiter: StringType, requested_index: NumberType = None)`**
    4. **Code snippet:**
    ```python
    def split(self, delimiter: StringType, requested_index: NumberType = None) -> '_ArrayExpression':
        """
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/splitfunction
        """
        if requested_index is None:
            return _ArrayExpression(KQL(f'split({self.kql}, {_to_kql(delimiter)})')) # Vulnerability: delimiter is directly injected
        return _ArrayExpression(KQL(f'split({self.kql}, {_to_kql(delimiter)}, {_to_kql(requested_index)})')) # Vulnerability: delimiter is directly injected
    ```
    5. **Visualization:**
       ```
       User Input (delimiter) --> split() function --> KQL query string (delimiter injected) --> Azure Data Explorer (query executed with injected code)
       ```
    6. The `_to_kql(delimiter)` function is used to convert the delimiter to KQL format, but it does not sanitize or validate the input to prevent injection. It simply wraps string literals in quotes. If the delimiter itself contains malicious KQL code, it will be included in the final query.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition**: Assume an application uses pykusto to query Azure Data Explorer and allows users to specify a delimiter for the `split` function on a string column.
    2. **Attacker Input**: The attacker provides the following malicious delimiter: `');take 9999//`
    3. **Code to trigger vulnerability**:
    ```python
    from pykusto import PyKustoClient, Query, column_generator as col

    client = PyKustoClient("https://help.kusto.windows.net") # Replace with your cluster if needed
    table = client.Samples.StormEvents
    string_col = table.EventDetails # Assuming StormEvents table has EventDetails column of type string

    malicious_delimiter = "');take 9999//"
    query = Query(table).extend(
        injected_query=string_col.split(malicious_delimiter).array_length()
    )
    kql_query = query.render()
    print(kql_query)
    # Execute the query (replace with actual execution if you have access to a Kusto cluster)
    # result = table.execute(kql_query)
    # print(result.to_dataframe())
    ```
    4. **Expected Outcome**:
        - The generated KQL query will be:
        ```
        StormEvents
        | extend injected_query = split(EventDetails, ');take 9999//').array_length()
        ```
        - When executed, this query will first perform the `split` operation, and then the injected Kusto code `;take 9999//` will be executed. The `take 9999` command, while not immediately harmful, demonstrates successful code injection. A real attacker could inject more malicious code.
    5. **Evidence of Vulnerability**: The injected `take 9999` command is appended and executed as part of the Kusto query, demonstrating successful injection.


#### 3. Python Code Injection in User-Defined Function (UDF)

*   **Description:**
    1. The `_stringify_python_func` function in `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py` converts a Python function object into a string representation of Python code.
    2. This string is then embedded directly into a Kusto query when using the `evaluate_udf` function.
    3. If an attacker could influence the Python function object that is passed to `evaluate_udf`, they could inject arbitrary Python code into the Kusto query.
    4. While direct external control over the function object is not exposed through the PyKusto API, if an application using PyKusto constructs UDFs based on external or untrusted input (e.g., reading function code from a file specified by a user, or dynamically generating function code based on user-provided parameters), a code injection vulnerability could arise.
    5. When the query with the injected UDF is executed against Azure Data Explorer, the injected Python code will be executed within the context of the Kusto Python plugin, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data access, or manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** An attacker could execute arbitrary Python code within the Azure Data Explorer's Python plugin sandbox. This could lead to:
        1. Unauthorized data access: The attacker could bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive information from the Kusto database.
        2. Data manipulation: The attacker could modify or delete data within the Kusto database, leading to data integrity issues.
        3. Lateral movement: In a compromised environment, the attacker might be able to leverage code execution within the Kusto plugin to pivot to other parts of the Azure environment, depending on the plugin's permissions and network access.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   There are no specific mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent code injection through the `_stringify_python_func` function. The code focuses on functionality rather than input sanitization or validation for security purposes in this area.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input validation and sanitization:** If UDF definitions are ever constructed based on external input, rigorous validation and sanitization of the function code would be necessary before passing it to `_stringify_python_func`. However, the current PyKusto API does not expose a direct mechanism for users to provide raw function code strings, so this is more of a concern for applications *using* PyKusto if they choose to build such functionality.
    *   **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure that the Kusto cluster and the permissions granted to the identity running PyKusto queries follow the principle of least privilege. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if code injection is successful. However, this is a general security best practice and not a specific mitigation within PyKusto itself.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   An application using PyKusto must allow for dynamic construction of Python UDFs based on potentially untrusted or externally influenced input.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the Python function that gets stringified and sent to Kusto.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/pykusto/_src/udf.py`
    2. **Function:** `_stringify_python_func(func: FunctionType)`
    3. **Code:**
    ```python
    from types import FunctionType


    def _stringify_python_func(func: FunctionType):
        return """from types import CodeType\\ncode=CodeType({},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{})\\nexec(code)\\n""".format(
            func.__code__.co_argcount,
            func.__code__.co_kwonlyargcount,
            func.__code__.co_nlocals,
            func.__code__.co_stacksize,
            func.__code__.co_flags,
            func.__code__.co_code,
            func.__code__.co_consts,
            func.__code__.co_names,
            func.__code__.co_varnames,
            "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_filename),
            "'{}'".format(func.__code__.co_name),
            func.__code__.co_firstlineno,
            func.__code__.co_lnotab,
            func.__code__.co_freevars,
            func.__code__.co_cellvars
        ).replace("\\x", "\\\\x")
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Point:** The function takes a Python `FunctionType` object and extracts various code attributes like `co_code`, `co_consts`, `co_names`, etc. These attributes are then directly formatted into a string that constructs Python code using `CodeType` and `exec(code)`.
    5. **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can somehow manipulate the attributes of the `func` object (which is not directly through PyKusto API but possible in a broader application context), they can inject arbitrary code into the string. This string is then sent to Kusto as part of the `evaluate python(...)` query. When Kusto executes this query, the `exec(code)` part will run the attacker's injected code within the Kusto Python plugin environment.
    6. **Visualization:**

    ```
    [Attacker Input (indirectly through application)] --> Manipulated Function Object --> _stringify_python_func() --> Malicious Python Code String --> Embedded in Kusto Query (evaluate python(...)) --> Azure Data Explorer (Kusto Python Plugin execution) --> Vulnerability Triggered (Code Injection)
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** You will need a PyKusto client connected to a test Kusto cluster or a mock environment that can execute queries with the `evaluate python` plugin. For a real test, ensure you have appropriate permissions to execute Python plugins in your test Kusto cluster.
    2. **Craft Malicious Function:** Define a Python function with malicious code. For example, a function that attempts to read environment variables or access other resources (in a real-world scenario, more damaging actions could be attempted). For testing, a simple example is to try to write to a file within the sandbox (though file system access might be restricted in the Kusto plugin). A less risky test is to simply try to return a string that indicates successful code injection.
    3. **Example Malicious Function (for testing - be cautious in production):**
    ```python
    def malicious_func():
        import os
        return "INJECTED: " + os.environ.get("PATH", "FAILED_TO_GET_PATH")
    ```
    4. **Execute `evaluate_udf` with Malicious Function:** Use PyKusto's `evaluate_udf` to execute a query with the `malicious_func`.
    ```python
    from pykusto import PyKustoClient, Query, column_generator as col, Functions as f, _KustoType

    # Assume 'client' is your PyKustoClient instance
    table = client.database("Samples").table("StormEvents")

    def malicious_func():
        import os
        return "INJECTED: " + os.environ.get("PATH", "FAILED_TO_GET_PATH")

    query_with_injection = Query(table).take(1) # Simple query to add the UDF to
    query_with_udf = query_with_injection.evaluate_udf(malicious_func, injected_code_result=_KustoType.STRING) # Capture output in 'injected_code_result' column

    df_with_injection = query_with_udf.to_dataframe()
    print(df_with_injection['injected_code_result']) # Check if 'INJECTED:' is in the output, indicating code execution
    ```
    5. **Verify Code Execution:** Examine the results of the query execution. If the function `malicious_func`'s code was executed, you should see the string "INJECTED: ..." in the output column `injected_code_result`. This confirms the code injection vulnerability. In a real attack scenario, a successful exploit would not be as easily visible in the output but could have side effects like data exfiltration or modification.
