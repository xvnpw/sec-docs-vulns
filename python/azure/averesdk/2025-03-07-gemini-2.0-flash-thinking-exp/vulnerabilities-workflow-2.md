### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Weak Default Administrative Password
- Description:
    1. The `vfxt.py` script allows users to create Avere vFXT clusters with an administrative password set using the `--admin-password` option.
    2. The documentation examples in `README.md` and `docs/azure_reference.md` use `admin_password` as a placeholder value for this option.
    3. A user might mistakenly use this placeholder value or a common password when creating a cluster.
    4. An attacker could attempt to gain unauthorized access to the vFXT cluster by trying to log in with this weak or default password.
    5. If successful, the attacker can manage the vFXT cluster and potentially access sensitive data or disrupt operations.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Avere vFXT cluster's administrative interface.
    - Potential compromise of sensitive data stored in or accessed through the vFXT cluster.
    - Disruption of vFXT cluster operations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself. The script relies on the user to provide a strong password.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Password strength validation during cluster creation to enforce strong passwords.
    - Warning message in the documentation against using weak or default passwords, and recommending strong, unique passwords.
    - Option to generate a strong random password if the user does not provide one, encouraging better security practices.
- Preconditions:
    - A user creates an Avere vFXT cluster using `vfxt.py`.
    - The user sets a weak administrative password, such as the placeholder `admin_password` from documentation examples or a common password.
    - The attacker knows or guesses the cluster's management address.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/vfxt.py`
    2. Argument parser is initialized, including `--admin-password` option:
    ```python
    cluster_opts = parser.add_argument_group('Cluster configuration', 'Options for cluster configuration')
    cluster_opts.add_argument("--cluster-name", help="Name for the cluster (also used to tag resources)")
    ...
    cluster_opts.add_argument("--admin-password", help="Admin password for cluster", default=None, type=_validate_ascii)
    ```
    3. The `admin_password` argument is used in `Cluster.create` function call:
    ```python
    cluster = Cluster.create(service, args.instance_type, args.cluster_name, args.admin_password, **options)
    ```
    4. The `Cluster.create` function in `/code/vFXT/cluster.py` passes the `admin_password` to the backend service without any strength validation:
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, service, machine_type, name, admin_password, **options):
        ...
        try:
            cluster = Cluster.create(service, args.instance_type, args.cluster_name, args.admin_password, **options)
        ...
    ```
    5. The password is used to initialize the cluster without any checks for password complexity or common weak passwords.
    6. The documentation examples in `/code/README.md` and `/code/docs/azure_reference.md` use `admin_password` as a placeholder, which could be directly copied and used by users:
    ```markdown
    ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin_password"
    ```
    ```bash
    --admin-password       "admin_password"
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: An Avere vFXT cluster is deployed using `vfxt.py` with the administrative password set to the weak password `admin_password` (or any other common weak password like `password123`).
    2. **Action**: An attacker attempts to access the Avere Control Panel or XML-RPC API of the deployed vFXT cluster using the username `admin` and the password `admin_password`.
    3. **Expected Result**: The attacker successfully authenticates to the vFXT cluster's administrative interface due to the weak password, gaining unauthorized access.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Azure Credentials in Environment Variables
- Description:
    1. `vfxt.py` supports authentication using Azure service principal credentials passed via command-line arguments: `--subscription-id`, `--tenant-id`, `--application-id`, and `--application-secret`.
    2. When using the `--from-environment` option, `vfxt.py` reads these credentials from environment variables `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. This is explicitly mentioned in the source code analysis section of `vfxt.py`.
    3. Environment variables are often stored in process memory and can be potentially exposed to other processes or users on the system, especially in shared environments or if not properly secured.
    4. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the environment where `vfxt.py` is executed could potentially retrieve these credentials.
    5. With compromised Azure credentials, an attacker can manage Avere vFXT clusters and potentially other Azure resources within the scope of the compromised service principal.
- Impact:
    - High
    - An attacker who gains access to the environment where `vfxt.py` is run (e.g., a compromised controller VM or a user's workstation) can steal the Azure service principal credentials.
    - Using these credentials, the attacker can then use `vfxt.py` or other Azure tools to:
        - Manage, modify, or delete Avere vFXT clusters.
        - Potentially access data stored in the cloud core filers associated with the clusters.
        - Potentially manage other Azure resources if the compromised service principal has broader permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself regarding environment variable storage.
    - Documentation (`docs/azure_reference.md`) recommends using azure-cli authentication as a user, which relies on user-specific credentials managed by azure-cli, potentially offering better isolation than shared environment variables. However, it still mentions service principal and environment variable based authentication without explicit security warnings.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Warning in documentation**: Explicitly warn users in the documentation against storing service principal credentials in environment variables due to security risks. Recommend using more secure methods like Azure Managed Identities where possible, or securely storing and retrieving credentials from a vault.
    - **Input sanitization**: While not directly mitigating the storage issue, ensure that if environment variables are used, the values are read securely and validated, although this doesn't prevent exposure at rest or in memory.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must choose to use service principal authentication with the `--from-environment` option, and store Azure credentials in environment variables.
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the environment (e.g., shell session, controller VM, CI/CD pipeline) where `vfxt.py` is executed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `vfxt.py`, within the `main` function, under the `elif args.cloud_type == 'azure':` block, and further inside `if args.from_environment:`:
    ```python
    if args.from_environment:
        if not all([args.resource_group, args.location, args.azure_network, args.azure_subnet]):
            logger.error("Arguments azure-network, azure-subnet, location, and resource_group are required with environment")
            parser.exit(1)
    else:
        if not all([args.application_id, args.application_secret, args.tenant_id]):
            logger.error("Arguments tenant-id, application-id, and application-secret are required")
            parser.exit(1)

            if not args.subscription_id:
                subscriptions = Service._list_subscriptions(
                    application_id=args.application_id,
                    application_secret=args.application_secret,
                    tenant_id=args.tenant_id)
                args.subscription_id = subscriptions[0]['subscriptionId']

        if not all([args.subscription_id, args.azure_network, args.azure_subnet, args.resource_group, args.location]):
            logger.error("Arguments subscription-id, azure-network, azure-subnet, resource_group, and location are required")
            parser.exit(1)


        # set these env vars based on the credentials passed into vfxt.py
        # DefaultAzureCredential will use them to create an EnvironmentCredential
        os.environ['AZURE_TENANT_ID'] = args.tenant_id
        os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'] = args.application_id
        os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'] = args.application_secret
    ```
    - This code block shows that when `--from-environment` is used, and when `--application-id`, `--application-secret`, and `--tenant-id` are provided as command-line arguments (even if not using `--from-environment` directly but other authentication methods which might eventually use environment variables), the script sets environment variables `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    - Later in the `Service.environment_init()` function in `vFXT/msazure.py`, the `DefaultAzureCredential` is used, which by default can pick up credentials from environment variables if set.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up an Azure Service Principal and obtain its `application-id`, `application-secret`, and `tenant-id`.
    2. On a test machine (e.g., a VM or a local machine), set environment variables `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` with the Service Principal credentials obtained in step 1.
    3. Install `vfxt.py` and its dependencies on the test machine.
    4. As an attacker, gain access to the environment where `vfxt.py` is installed. This could be through SSH access, local access if it's a shared machine, or by compromising a process running with the same user.
    5. Once inside the environment, retrieve the environment variables `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. The method to retrieve environment variables depends on the OS (e.g., `printenv` or `echo %VARIABLE_NAME%` in shell, or accessing `os.environ` in Python).
    6. Using these retrieved credentials, attempt to authenticate to Azure using the Azure CLI or another Azure SDK. For example, use `az login --service-principal -u <application-id> -p <application-secret> --tenant <tenant-id>`.
    7. If login is successful, it confirms that the credentials stored in environment variables can be used to authenticate to Azure, demonstrating the vulnerability.
    8. As a further step, attempt to use `vfxt.py` with the `--from-environment` flag from a different, attacker-controlled machine, confirming that the stolen credentials allow managing vFXT clusters.

These vulnerabilities represent critical security concerns that should be addressed to enhance the security posture of the Avere vFXT cluster deployment and management tools.
