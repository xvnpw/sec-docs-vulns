- Vulnerability Name: Weak Default Administrative Password
- Description:
    1. The `vfxt.py` script allows users to create Avere vFXT clusters with an administrative password set using the `--admin-password` option.
    2. The documentation examples in `README.md` and `docs/azure_reference.md` use `admin_password` as a placeholder value for this option.
    3. A user might mistakenly use this placeholder value or a common password when creating a cluster.
    4. An attacker could attempt to gain unauthorized access to the vFXT cluster by trying to log in with this weak or default password.
    5. If successful, the attacker can manage the vFXT cluster and potentially access sensitive data or disrupt operations.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Avere vFXT cluster's administrative interface.
    - Potential compromise of sensitive data stored in or accessed through the vFXT cluster.
    - Disruption of vFXT cluster operations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself. The script relies on the user to provide a strong password.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Password strength validation during cluster creation to enforce strong passwords.
    - Warning message in the documentation against using weak or default passwords, and recommending strong, unique passwords.
    - Option to generate a strong random password if the user does not provide one, encouraging better security practices.
- Preconditions:
    - A user creates an Avere vFXT cluster using `vfxt.py`.
    - The user sets a weak administrative password, such as the placeholder `admin_password` from documentation examples or a common password.
    - The attacker knows or guesses the cluster's management address.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/vfxt.py`
    2. Argument parser is initialized, including `--admin-password` option:
    ```python
    cluster_opts = parser.add_argument_group('Cluster configuration', 'Options for cluster configuration')
    cluster_opts.add_argument("--cluster-name", help="Name for the cluster (also used to tag resources)")
    ...
    cluster_opts.add_argument("--admin-password", help="Admin password for cluster", default=None, type=_validate_ascii)
    ```
    3. The `admin_password` argument is used in `Cluster.create` function call:
    ```python
    cluster = Cluster.create(service, args.instance_type, args.cluster_name, args.admin_password, **options)
    ```
    4. The `Cluster.create` function in `/code/vFXT/cluster.py` passes the `admin_password` to the backend service without any strength validation:
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, service, machine_type, name, admin_password, **options):
        ...
        try:
            cluster = Cluster.create(service, args.instance_type, args.cluster_name, args.admin_password, **options)
        ...
    ```
    5. The password is used to initialize the cluster without any checks for password complexity or common weak passwords.
    6. The documentation examples in `/code/README.md` and `/code/docs/azure_reference.md` use `admin_password` as a placeholder, which could be directly copied and used by users:
    ```markdown
    ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin_password"
    ```
    ```bash
    --admin-password       "admin_password"
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: An Avere vFXT cluster is deployed using `vfxt.py` with the administrative password set to the weak password `admin_password` (or any other common weak password like `password123`).
    2. **Action**: An attacker attempts to access the Avere Control Panel or XML-RPC API of the deployed vFXT cluster using the username `admin` and the password `admin_password`.
    3. **Expected Result**: The attacker successfully authenticates to the vFXT cluster's administrative interface due to the weak password, gaining unauthorized access.
