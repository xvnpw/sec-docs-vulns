Based on the provided vulnerability list, which is currently empty ("*None*"), and considering the instructions and the context about potential injection vulnerabilities in user-developed Azure Functions due to unsanitized inputs, let's re-evaluate if we should add any vulnerability to the list.

The initial assessment correctly states that "no vulnerabilities were identified in the Azure Functions Python Library itself that directly introduce injection flaws...". This is a crucial point. The description provided in the prompt is not about a vulnerability *in* the library, but rather a *potential risk* when *using* the library to build Azure Functions. The risk resides in the developer's code, not the library's code.

The library provides tools for building Azure Functions, but it's the responsibility of the function developer to sanitize inputs and prevent injection vulnerabilities within their function's logic. The library itself is not inherently vulnerable to injection.

Following the instructions to "Include only valid vulnerabilities that are part of attack vector" and "Exclude vulnerabilities that... are only theoretical, e.g. missing evidence of exploit in source code analysis", and given that no concrete vulnerability in the library itself has been described or identified, and the description rather points to a potential risk in *user-developed applications*, the initial assessment of an empty vulnerability list is correct.

The description provided is more of a general security advice for developers using the library, highlighting the importance of input sanitization in their Azure Functions to prevent injection attacks. It does not describe a vulnerability in the library itself.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the instructions to filter and list *actual vulnerabilities*, and considering that no vulnerability in the library itself was identified, the vulnerability list should remain empty.
