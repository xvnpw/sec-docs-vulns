## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Malicious Rule Injection

- Description: An attacker can contribute a malicious rule to the static code analysis ruleset. This rule can be designed to mislead developers by:
    - Generating false positive vulnerability reports for benign code, overwhelming developers with irrelevant alerts.
    - Suppressing or hiding reports of genuine vulnerabilities, causing developers to overlook critical security issues.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
    1. Create a malicious rule file (e.g., a crafted `windup.yaml` file).
    2. Submit a pull request to the project repository containing this malicious rule.
    3. If the pull request is merged without sufficient review, the malicious rule becomes part of the active ruleset.
    4. Developers using the Konveyor analyzer with the updated ruleset will then be subject to misleading vulnerability reports.
- Impact:
    - Reduced developer productivity due to time wasted investigating false positives.
    - Increased security risk in migrated Azure applications as real vulnerabilities are overlooked.
    - Potential (though less likely) data exfiltration or manipulation of analysis results.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Contributor License Agreement (CLA): Required for all contributions.
    - Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct: Project adheres to the code of conduct.
    - Security Reporting Guidelines: Guidelines for reporting security issues are provided.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Rule Review Process: A formal, documented process for security review of contributed rules is missing.
    - Rule Testing and Validation: Automated or manual testing to validate rules for security implications and accuracy is not implemented.
    - Input Sanitization/Validation in Rule Processing: Robust input validation within the analyzer to prevent malicious rules from exploiting the tool itself is not mentioned.
    - Least Privilege for Rule Processing: Running the analyzer with least necessary privileges is not explicitly stated.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker successfully contributes a malicious rule to the project.
    - Malicious rule is merged into the ruleset without adequate review.
    - Developers use the compromised ruleset with the Konveyor analyzer.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not within the code of this repository itself, but rather in the potential for malicious content within the rulesets and the lack of a rigorous rule review process.
    - Examining the rule files (e.g., `windup.yaml`) reveals that rules are defined in YAML, consisting of `when` conditions and a `message` to display when the conditions are met.
    - A malicious rule can manipulate the `message` to be misleading or suppress vulnerability information.
    - The `when` condition can be crafted to trigger false positives or to avoid triggering on malicious code (false negatives).
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a local Konveyor analyzer environment.
        - Create a test Java application containing a known vulnerability (e.g., a simple SQL injection).
        - Create a benign test Java application code.
        - Create a malicious rule (`malicious-rule.yaml`) designed to:
            - *False Negative:* Not flag the known vulnerability in the test Java application.
            - *False Positive:* Flag a benign code pattern (e.g., a common logging statement) in the benign test Java application as a "critical vulnerability".
    2. **Attack:**
        - Simulate a malicious contribution by manually adding the `malicious-rule.yaml` to the ruleset directory used by the Konveyor analyzer.
        - Run the Konveyor analyzer against the test Java application with the known vulnerability, using the modified ruleset.
        - Run the Konveyor analyzer against the benign test Java application, using the modified ruleset.
    3. **Verification:**
        - **False Negative:** Observe that the Konveyor analyzer output *does not* report the known vulnerability in the test Java application.
        - **False Positive:** Observe that the Konveyor analyzer output *incorrectly* reports a "critical vulnerability" in the benign test Java application due to the malicious rule, for example flagging a log statement as "critical vulnerability".

### Vulnerability: Rule Misreporting Vulnerability Rank

- Description:
    - A malicious contributor can craft a rule that is designed to misreport the vulnerability rank of findings.
    - This can be achieved by setting a low `vulnerabilityRank` in a rule definition, regardless of the actual severity indicated by the `category` or `description`.
    - When a user analyzes their Java application with such a malicious rule included in the rulesets, the static analysis tool will report findings with the misleadingly low vulnerability rank.
    - This can lead users to underestimate the security risks identified by the analyzer.
- Impact:
    - Users relying on the Konveyor analyzer with malicious rules may be misled about the true severity of vulnerabilities in their Java applications.
    - Critical security vulnerabilities could be downgraded to lower ranks (e.g., "low" or "medium"), causing users to overlook or deprioritize addressing them.
    - This can result in unmitigated critical vulnerabilities in user applications deployed to Azure, increasing the risk of security breaches.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required for all contributions. This provides a legal framework for contributions.
    - Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct is adopted. This sets expectations for contributor behavior.
    - Code review process exists as contributions are made through pull requests.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Automated vulnerability rank validation: Implement automated checks to ensure that the reported vulnerability rank in a rule accurately reflects the actual severity of the identified issue.
    - Security focused code review: Enhance the code review process to include a dedicated security review, specifically looking for malicious rule patterns and misreporting vulnerabilities.
    - Security test case framework: Develop a security test case framework to test rules for malicious behavior, including rank misreporting, and ensure the rules function as intended without security flaws.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to contribute to the project, which is achieved by submitting a pull request.
    - A pull request containing a malicious rule must be reviewed and merged by project maintainers despite the malicious nature of the rule.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is present in the design of the rule contribution and review process rather than in the source code of the analysis engine itself.
    - The rules are defined in YAML files. A malicious rule can be created by manipulating the `vulnerabilityRank` field within a rule definition file.
    - Example of a malicious rule in a YAML file (`malicious-rule.yaml`):

    ```yaml
    - category: critical
      description: "Malicious Rule: Always reports low severity, masking critical issues."
      effort: 0
      labels:
      - malicious.rule
      message: "This rule is designed to misreport vulnerability severity."
      ruleID: malicious-rank-misreporting-00001
      vulnerabilityRank: low # Misleadingly low rank
      when:
        java.always_true: {} # Rule always triggers
    ```

    - In this example, even though the `category` is set to "critical" and the `description` indicates malicious intent, the `vulnerabilityRank` is intentionally set to "low". This will cause the analyzer to report a low severity for this finding, regardless of the actual risk it represents.
    - The vulnerability lies in the fact that the analyzer blindly trusts the `vulnerabilityRank` specified in the rule definition without proper validation or security checks.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new YAML file named `malicious-rank-rule.yaml` in the `/code/default/generated/` directory (or any relevant ruleset directory) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    - category: critical
      description: "Test Rule: Misreporting vulnerability rank to Low"
      effort: 0
      labels:
      - test.rule
      message: "This is a test rule to verify vulnerability rank misreporting."
      ruleID: test-rank-misreporting-00001
      vulnerabilityRank: low
      when:
        java.always_true: {}
    ```

    2. Build or run the Konveyor analyzer in a test environment that includes this new rule.
    3. Analyze a sample Java project using the analyzer with the newly added `malicious-rank-rule.yaml` rule.
    4. Examine the analyzer's output/report for the findings related to the `test-rank-misreporting-00001` ruleID.
    5. Verify that the reported vulnerability rank for the `test-rank-misreporting-00001` rule is "low", as defined in the rule, despite the `category` being "critical".
    6. This confirms that a malicious contributor can successfully misreport vulnerability ranks by manipulating the `vulnerabilityRank` field in a rule definition.
