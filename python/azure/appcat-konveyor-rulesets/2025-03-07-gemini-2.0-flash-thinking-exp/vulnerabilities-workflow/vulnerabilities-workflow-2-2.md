- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Rule Injection
- Description: An attacker can contribute a malicious rule to the static code analysis ruleset. This rule can be designed to mislead developers by:
    - Generating false positive vulnerability reports for benign code, overwhelming developers with irrelevant alerts.
    - Suppressing or hiding reports of genuine vulnerabilities, causing developers to overlook critical security issues.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
    1. Create a malicious rule file (e.g., a crafted `windup.yaml` file).
    2. Submit a pull request to the project repository containing this malicious rule.
    3. If the pull request is merged without sufficient review, the malicious rule becomes part of the active ruleset.
    4. Developers using the Konveyor analyzer with the updated ruleset will then be subject to misleading vulnerability reports.
- Impact:
    - Reduced developer productivity due to time wasted investigating false positives.
    - Increased security risk in migrated Azure applications as real vulnerabilities are overlooked.
    - Potential (though less likely) data exfiltration or manipulation of analysis results.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Contributor License Agreement (CLA): Required for all contributions.
    - Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct: Project adheres to the code of conduct.
    - Security Reporting Guidelines: Guidelines for reporting security issues are provided.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Rule Review Process: A formal, documented process for security review of contributed rules is missing.
    - Rule Testing and Validation: Automated or manual testing to validate rules for security implications and accuracy is not implemented.
    - Input Sanitization/Validation in Rule Processing: Robust input validation within the analyzer to prevent malicious rules from exploiting the tool itself is not mentioned.
    - Least Privilege for Rule Processing: Running the analyzer with least necessary privileges is not explicitly stated.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker successfully contributes a malicious rule to the project.
    - Malicious rule is merged into the ruleset without adequate review.
    - Developers use the compromised ruleset with the Konveyor analyzer.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not within the code of this repository itself, but rather in the potential for malicious content within the rulesets and the lack of a rigorous rule review process.
    - Examining the rule files (e.g., `windup.yaml`) reveals that rules are defined in YAML, consisting of `when` conditions and a `message` to display when the conditions are met.
    - A malicious rule can manipulate the `message` to be misleading or suppress vulnerability information.
    - The `when` condition can be crafted to trigger false positives or to avoid triggering on malicious code (false negatives).
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a local Konveyor analyzer environment.
        - Create a test Java application containing a known vulnerability (e.g., a simple SQL injection).
        - Create a benign test Java application code.
        - Create a malicious rule (`malicious-rule.yaml`) designed to:
            - *False Negative:* Not flag the known vulnerability in the test Java application.
            - *False Positive:* Flag a benign code pattern (e.g., a common logging statement) in the benign test Java application as a "critical vulnerability".
    2. **Attack:**
        - Simulate a malicious contribution by manually adding the `malicious-rule.yaml` to the ruleset directory used by the Konveyor analyzer.
        - Run the Konveyor analyzer against the test Java application with the known vulnerability, using the modified ruleset.
        - Run the Konveyor analyzer against the benign test Java application, using the modified ruleset.
    3. **Verification:**
        - **False Negative:** Observe that the Konveyor analyzer output *does not* report the known vulnerability in the test Java application.
        - **False Positive:** Observe that the Konveyor analyzer output *incorrectly* reports a "critical vulnerability" in the benign test Java application due to the malicious rule, for example flagging a log statement as "critical vulnerability".
