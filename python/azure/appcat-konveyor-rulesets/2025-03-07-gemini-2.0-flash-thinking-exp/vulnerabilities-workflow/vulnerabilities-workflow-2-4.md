### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Rule Misreporting Vulnerability Rank

* Description:
    * A malicious contributor can craft a rule that is designed to misreport the vulnerability rank of findings.
    * This can be achieved by setting a low `vulnerabilityRank` in a rule definition, regardless of the actual severity indicated by the `category` or `description`.
    * When a user analyzes their Java application with such a malicious rule included in the rulesets, the static analysis tool will report findings with the misleadingly low vulnerability rank.
    * This can lead users to underestimate the security risks identified by the analyzer.

* Impact:
    * Users relying on the Konveyor analyzer with malicious rules may be misled about the true severity of vulnerabilities in their Java applications.
    * Critical security vulnerabilities could be downgraded to lower ranks (e.g., "low" or "medium"), causing users to overlook or deprioritize addressing them.
    * This can result in unmitigated critical vulnerabilities in user applications deployed to Azure, increasing the risk of security breaches.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required for all contributions. This provides a legal framework for contributions.
    * Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct is adopted. This sets expectations for contributor behavior.
    * Code review process exists as contributions are made through pull requests.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Automated vulnerability rank validation: Implement automated checks to ensure that the reported vulnerability rank in a rule accurately reflects the actual severity of the identified issue.
    * Security focused code review: Enhance the code review process to include a dedicated security review, specifically looking for malicious rule patterns and misreporting vulnerabilities.
    * Security test case framework: Develop a security test case framework to test rules for malicious behavior, including rank misreporting, and ensure the rules function as intended without security flaws.

* Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to be able to contribute to the project, which is achieved by submitting a pull request.
    * A pull request containing a malicious rule must be reviewed and merged by project maintainers despite the malicious nature of the rule.

* Source Code Analysis:
    * The vulnerability is present in the design of the rule contribution and review process rather than in the source code of the analysis engine itself.
    * The rules are defined in YAML files. A malicious rule can be created by manipulating the `vulnerabilityRank` field within a rule definition file.
    * Example of a malicious rule in a YAML file (`malicious-rule.yaml`):

    ```yaml
    - category: critical
      description: "Malicious Rule: Always reports low severity, masking critical issues."
      effort: 0
      labels:
      - malicious.rule
      message: "This rule is designed to misreport vulnerability severity."
      ruleID: malicious-rank-misreporting-00001
      vulnerabilityRank: low # Misleadingly low rank
      when:
        java.always_true: {} # Rule always triggers
    ```

    * In this example, even though the `category` is set to "critical" and the `description` indicates malicious intent, the `vulnerabilityRank` is intentionally set to "low". This will cause the analyzer to report a low severity for this finding, regardless of the actual risk it represents.
    * The vulnerability lies in the fact that the analyzer blindly trusts the `vulnerabilityRank` specified in the rule definition without proper validation or security checks.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new YAML file named `malicious-rank-rule.yaml` in the `/code/default/generated/` directory (or any relevant ruleset directory) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    - category: critical
      description: "Test Rule: Misreporting vulnerability rank to Low"
      effort: 0
      labels:
      - test.rule
      message: "This is a test rule to verify vulnerability rank misreporting."
      ruleID: test-rank-misreporting-00001
      vulnerabilityRank: low
      when:
        java.always_true: {}
    ```

    2. Build or run the Konveyor analyzer in a test environment that includes this new rule.
    3. Analyze a sample Java project using the analyzer with the newly added `malicious-rank-rule.yaml` rule.
    4. Examine the analyzer's output/report for the findings related to the `test-rank-misreporting-00001` ruleID.
    5. Verify that the reported vulnerability rank for the `test-rank-misreporting-00001` rule is "low", as defined in the rule, despite the `category` being "critical".
    6. This confirms that a malicious contributor can successfully misreport vulnerability ranks by manipulating the `vulnerabilityRank` field in a rule definition.
