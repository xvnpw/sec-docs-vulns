Here is the vulnerability in markdown format:

```markdown
- Vulnerability Name: Credential Exposure via Command-Line Arguments
- Description:
    1. The Cosmos TLS Scanner script requires users to provide the Azure Cosmos DB authorization key as a command-line argument using the `--authorization-key` or `-k` parameter.
    2. When a user executes the script with the authorization key in the command line, the entire command, including the sensitive authorization key, is recorded in the command history of the user's shell (e.g., `.bash_history` for bash, `.zsh_history` for zsh, or command history in PowerShell).
    3. Additionally, depending on system logging configurations, the command execution, including the authorization key, might be logged in system logs.
    4. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's command history files or system logs, they can easily retrieve the Cosmos DB authorization key in plain text.
    5. This exposed authorization key can then be used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the targeted Azure Cosmos DB account, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- Impact:
    - Exposure of the Cosmos DB authorization key.
    - Unauthorized access to the Azure Cosmos DB account by malicious actors.
    - Potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service against the Cosmos DB account.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script currently requires the authorization key to be passed as a command-line argument without any alternative secure input methods.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Avoid passing credentials as command-line arguments:** The script should be modified to avoid accepting the authorization key directly as a command-line argument.
    - **Implement alternative secure credential input methods:**
        - Support reading the authorization key from environment variables. This prevents the key from being directly visible in command history.
        - Support reading the authorization key from a secure configuration file with restricted access permissions.
        - Consider using Azure Managed Identities or Azure Key Vault for more secure credential management in Azure environments, although this might be overkill for a standalone script.
    - **Documentation update:** The documentation (README.md) should be updated to explicitly warn users about the security risks of passing the authorization key as a command-line argument and recommend using environment variables or other secure methods for providing credentials.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` script and provide the Cosmos DB authorization key as a command-line argument.
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the user's command history files (e.g., `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`) or system logs where command executions are logged.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `_get_parser()` function in `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` uses `argparse` to define command-line arguments:
      ```python
      parser.add_argument(
          "--authorization-key",
          "-k",
          required=True,
          help="Master or Read-only key for account of the form khYANAIiAl12n...==",
      )
      ```
    - This code snippet explicitly defines `--authorization-key` as a required command-line argument.
    - When the script is executed, the `argparse` library parses the command-line arguments, including the authorization key provided by the user directly in the command.
    - The `main()` function then retrieves the authorization key from the parsed arguments:
      ```python
      args.authorization_key = args.authorization_key.strip()
      ```
    - The script proceeds to use this `args.authorization_key` to authenticate with Azure Cosmos DB in the `list_databases` and `basic_query` functions.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      User Command Line -->  argparse.parse_args()  -->  args.authorization_key  -->  _get_auth_header()  -->  Cosmos DB Authentication
                                  (Authorization Key in plain text)
      ```
    - The authorization key is handled as a plain text string throughout the script after being parsed from the command line, increasing the risk of exposure if command history or logs are compromised.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure you have Python 3.5.3+ and the required libraries installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). You also need an Azure Cosmos DB account endpoint and a valid authorization key.
    2. **Execution:** Open a terminal or command prompt. Execute the `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` script with the `--endpoint` and `--authorization-key` arguments, replacing `<endpoint>` with your Cosmos DB endpoint and `<key>` with your Cosmos DB authorization key. For example:
       ```bash
       python3 cosmos_tls_scanner.py --endpoint https://<your-cosmos-db-account>.documents.azure.com:443/ --authorization-key <your-cosmos-db-authorization-key>
       ```
    3. **Check Command History:**
        - **Bash/Zsh:** Open a new terminal and use the `history` command or examine the `.bash_history` or `.zsh_history` file in your home directory (e.g., `cat ~/.bash_history` or `cat ~/.zsh_history`).
        - **PowerShell:** Use the `Get-History` cmdlet or examine the `$HOME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` file.
    4. **Verification:** In the command history output or the history file, locate the command you executed in step 2.
    5. **Observation:** Observe that the command history contains the full command you executed, including the `--authorization-key` argument and the Cosmos DB authorization key in plain text. This confirms that the authorization key is exposed in the command history, making it potentially accessible to attackers who might gain access to the user's system or account.
