### Vulnerability 1: Authorization Key Exposure via Command Line Argument

- **Description:**
    The Cosmos TLS Scanner utility is designed to accept the Azure Cosmos DB authorization key as a command-line argument via the `--authorization-key` parameter. This method of providing sensitive credentials directly in the command line makes it vulnerable to exposure. An attacker could socially engineer a user into running a modified version of the `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` script. This modified script could be designed to log, display, or transmit the authorization key to an attacker-controlled location.  The legitimate script itself processes and uses this key for authentication to Azure Cosmos DB, and a malicious modification could intercept this key during or after the user provides it as a command-line argument.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability through a modified script:
    1.  An attacker creates a modified version of `cosmos_tls_scanner.py`.
    2.  In the modified script, the attacker adds code to capture the value of the `authorization-key` argument. This could be done by modifying the `main` function to log the `args.authorization_key` value to a file, display it on the console, or send it over a network to an attacker-controlled server.
    3.  The attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing, fake repositories, compromised websites) to trick a user into downloading and running this modified script.
    4.  The user, believing they are running the legitimate TLS scanner, executes the modified script and provides their Azure Cosmos DB endpoint and authorization key as command-line arguments as instructed in the original documentation.
    5.  The modified script captures the authorization key and performs the malicious action (logging, displaying, transmitting).
    6.  The attacker obtains the user's Azure Cosmos DB authorization key.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the complete compromise of the targeted Azure Cosmos DB account. An authorization key grants administrative privileges, allowing the attacker to:
    - Access all data within the Cosmos DB account.
    - Modify or delete data, including databases and collections.
    - Change account configurations.
    - Potentially use the compromised account to further attack other systems or data.
    The impact is considered critical as it allows for complete data breach, data manipulation, and potential service disruption.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
    Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There are no mitigations implemented within the provided code to prevent the exposure of the authorization key if a user is tricked into running a modified script. The script is designed to accept and use the key directly from the command line.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Strong Warning in Documentation:** The README.md should include a prominent security warning against providing the authorization key as a command-line argument, especially in untrusted environments. It should emphasize the risk of exposure and recommend alternative, more secure methods for handling credentials if possible (though for a standalone utility this might be challenging without significant code changes).  The documentation should stress verifying the script's integrity before execution.
    - **Input Sanitization (Limited Benefit):** While input sanitization in the script itself can prevent certain types of injection within the script's execution, it does not prevent the fundamental vulnerability of the key being exposed as a command-line argument if the script is maliciously modified. Therefore, sanitization is not a primary mitigation for this specific vulnerability.
    - **Alternative Input Methods (Consideration for Future Versions):** For future iterations, consider if there are alternative input methods for the authorization key that are less prone to direct exposure in command history or process listings. However, for a standalone utility, command-line arguments are often the most practical.  Environment variables could be considered, but also present risks if not handled carefully by the user.

- **Preconditions:**
    1.  An attacker must create a modified version of the `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` script designed to exfiltrate the authorization key.
    2.  The attacker must successfully socially engineer a user into downloading and executing this modified script.
    3.  The user must follow the instructions (from either legitimate or attacker-provided sources) and provide their valid Azure Cosmos DB endpoint and authorization key as command-line arguments when running the modified script.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`_get_parser()` function in `cosmos_tls_scanner.py`**:
        ```python
        def _get_parser():
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Azure Cosmos DB TLS Scanner")
            parser.add_argument(
                "--endpoint",
                "-e",
                required=True,
                help="Azure Cosmos DB database account endpoint. Example https://myaccount.documents.azure.com:443/",
            )
            parser.add_argument(
                "--authorization-key",
                "-k",
                required=True,
                help="Master or Read-only key for account of the form khYANAIiAl12n...==",
            )
            # ... (rest of arguments)
            return parser
        ```
        This function uses `argparse` to define the command-line arguments, including `--authorization-key`. The `required=True` argument forces the user to provide this key when running the script. The `help` text in the argument definition even prompts the user to input their "Master or Read-only key".

    2.  **`main()` function in `cosmos_tls_scanner.py`**:
        ```python
        def main(args):
            args.endpoint = args.endpoint.strip()
            args.authorization_key = args.authorization_key.strip()
            # ... (rest of main function)
        ```
        The `main` function retrieves the value of the `--authorization-key` argument from the `args` object provided by `argparse`. It then stores it in `args.authorization_key`.

    3.  **Usage in Authentication Functions (`_get_auth_header`, `list_databases`, `basic_query`)**:
        The `args.authorization_key` is then passed directly as the `key` parameter to the `_get_auth_header` function. This function is responsible for generating the Azure Cosmos DB authentication signature, using the provided key.  The `_get_auth_header` is called by both `list_databases` and `basic_query` functions, which perform the actual API calls to Azure Cosmos DB.

        ```python
        def list_databases(uri, key, ssl_version):
            # ...
            headers = {
                "authorization": _get_auth_header(
                    key, verb, resource_type, resource_link, date_str
                ),
                # ...
            }
            return _send_request(uri, ssl_version, verb, resource_type, resource_link, headers)
        ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Command Line Input --> argparse (_get_parser) --> args.authorization_key (in main) --> _get_auth_header (as 'key' parameter) --> Authentication Header --> API Request to Cosmos DB
    ```
    A malicious modification of the script can intercept `args.authorization_key` in the `main` function *before* it's used in the authentication functions, allowing for exfiltration.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare Malicious Script:**
        Create a modified version of `cosmos_tls_scanner.py` (e.g., `evil_scanner.py`). Modify the `main` function in `evil_scanner.py` to include the following lines at the beginning of the `main` function, right after `args.authorization_key = args.authorization_key.strip()`:

        ```python
        log_file = open("auth_key_log.txt", "w")  # Or send to a remote server
        log_file.write(f"Authorization Key: {args.authorization_key}\n")
        log_file.close()
        print("Authorization key logged to auth_key_log.txt (simulating exfiltration)") # Optional feedback to the user
        ```

    2.  **Social Engineering (Simulated):**
        Assume you have tricked a test user into downloading `evil_scanner.py` and they intend to use it to scan their Cosmos DB TLS settings.

    3.  **Execute Malicious Script:**
        The test user executes `evil_scanner.py` from their command line, providing their actual Azure Cosmos DB endpoint and authorization key:

        ```bash
        python3 evil_scanner.py --endpoint https://<your_cosmos_db_endpoint> --authorization-key <your_cosmos_db_authorization_key>
        ```

    4.  **Verify Key Exfiltration (Simulated):**
        After running the script, check for the `auth_key_log.txt` file in the same directory where `evil_scanner.py` was executed. The file should contain the authorization key that was provided as a command-line argument.  In a real attack, the key could be sent to a remote server instead of logged locally.

    5.  **Cleanup:**
        Delete `auth_key_log.txt` and `evil_scanner.py`.

    This test case demonstrates that by modifying the script, it's trivial to capture and exfiltrate the authorization key when provided as a command-line argument. This validates the vulnerability.
