### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Verbose Error Messages Leading to Information Leakage
- Description:
    1. The GitHub Action uses the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning.
    2. During error conditions, especially during workspace authentication (using `Workspace.from_config`), the action prints verbose error messages to the GitHub Actions logs.
    3. These error messages, while not directly logging the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret, can contain sensitive information such as workspace IDs, resource group names, or specific error details from Azure Active Directory or Azure Resource Manager.
    4. An attacker with access to the GitHub Actions logs could potentially glean information from these verbose error messages.
    5. This information could aid an attacker in understanding the target Azure environment, performing reconnaissance, or crafting more targeted attacks against the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Impact: Information leakage. An attacker can gain insights into the Azure Machine Learning workspace configuration, which can be used for reconnaissance or targeted attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Usage of `mask_parameter` function in `code/utils.py` to mask `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `subscriptionId` parameters before printing to logs.
    - JSON schema validation for `azure_credentials` in `code/main.py` to ensure the correct format of provided credentials, reducing potential configuration errors.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement more fine-grained control over error message verbosity, especially for authentication and workspace connection errors in `code/main.py`. Instead of directly printing exception objects, sanitize and provide only necessary error context in logs.
    - Review and sanitize all error messages printed to logs in `code/main.py`, ensuring no sensitive workspace or configuration details are inadvertently exposed through exception messages.
- Preconditions:
    - The GitHub Action workflow execution fails during workspace authentication or in other error scenarios where verbose error messages are printed by `code/main.py`.
    - An attacker has access to the GitHub Actions workflow logs. This could be a collaborator with read access to the repository's actions, or in case of misconfigured public repositories, potentially even external users.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `code/main.py`, examine the `try...except` block around `Workspace.from_config`:
    ```python
    try:
        ws = Workspace.from_config(
            path=config_file_path,
            _file_name=config_file_name,
            auth=sp_auth
        )
    except AuthenticationException as exception:
        print(f"::error::Could not retrieve user token. Please paste output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <your-sp-name> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<your-rg> --sdk-auth` as value of secret variable: AZURE_CREDENTIALS: {exception}")
        raise AuthenticationException
    except AuthenticationError as exception:
        print(f"::error::Microsoft REST Authentication Error: {exception}")
        raise AuthenticationError
    except AdalError as exception:
        print(f"::error::Active Directory Authentication Library Error: {exception}")
        raise AdalError
    except ProjectSystemException as exception:
        print(f"::error::Workspace authorization failed: {exception}")
        raise ProjectSystemException
    ```
    2. In each `except` block, the code currently prints the exception object directly using f-strings, for example: `print(f"::error::Could not retrieve user token. ...: {exception}")`.
    3. The `{exception}` part in these f-strings could potentially include verbose error details originating from the Azure SDKs or underlying authentication libraries. These details might contain sensitive information about the Azure subscription, tenant, workspace, or related Azure services, beyond a generic authentication failure message.
    4. While `mask_parameter` is used for credential values, it does not sanitize the exception messages themselves, leaving a potential information leakage vulnerability through verbose error logging.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Create a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Actions.
        - Create a workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/test-vuln.yml`) that uses the `Azure/aml-registermodel@v1` action.
        - In the workflow file, configure the `azure_credentials` input to use an invalid `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. For example, provide an incorrect `tenantId` or `subscriptionId` in the secret value.
        - Commit and push this workflow file to the repository.
    2. Trigger Vulnerability:
        - The workflow will be automatically triggered upon pushing the commit.
        - The `aml-registermodel` action will execute and attempt to authenticate with Azure ML using the invalid credentials. This will intentionally cause the `Workspace.from_config` call in `code/main.py` to fail, raising an authentication-related exception.
    3. Observe Logs:
        - Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.
        - Locate the workflow run that was triggered and click on it to view the run details.
        - Examine the logs for the `aml-registermodel` action step.
        - Search for error messages starting with `::error::` in the logs, specifically those originating from the `Workspace.from_config` block in `code/main.py`.
        - Analyze the content of these error messages. Check if they contain any sensitive information beyond a generic "authentication failed" message. For example, look for workspace IDs, resource group names, Azure region information, specific error codes from Azure Active Directory or Azure Resource Manager, or any details that could help an attacker understand the Azure environment's configuration.
    4. Expected Outcome:
        - If the logs contain detailed error messages that expose workspace-specific information (e.g., workspace ID, resource group, tenant ID in error details, specific Azure AD error codes related to the target subscription), then the vulnerability is confirmed. The verbose error messages are leaking potentially sensitive information.
        - If the error messages are generic and do not reveal specific workspace configuration details (e.g., just "Authentication failed" without further context), then the vulnerability is not present, or the information leakage is not significant in this specific scenario.
