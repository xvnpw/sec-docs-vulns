* Vulnerability Name: Malicious Model Registration via Parameters File Modification
* Description:
    1. An attacker forks the repository.
    2. The attacker creates a new branch in their forked repository.
    3. The attacker modifies the `parameters_file` (default: `registermodel.json`) within the forked repository. This modification can include:
        * Changing the `model_file_name` to point to a malicious model file hosted externally or within the attacker's forked repository.
        * Altering model registration parameters such as `model_name`, `model_description`, `model_tags`, or `model_properties` to inject malicious information or misrepresent the model.
    4. The attacker submits a pull request to the original repository, proposing to merge their malicious changes, including the modified `parameters_file`.
    5. If the repository maintainers merge this pull request without proper review and validation of the `parameters_file`, the GitHub Action workflow will execute using the attacker-supplied parameters.
    6. Consequently, a malicious model, or a model with attacker-defined metadata, will be registered in the Azure Machine Learning model registry.
* Impact:
    * **Malicious Model Registration:** Registering a malicious model can have severe consequences. If this model is subsequently deployed and used in production systems, it can lead to:
        * **Data Poisoning:** The malicious model might be designed to subtly corrupt data in downstream processes.
        * **Model Poisoning/Backdoor:** The model could contain backdoors or vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access or control over systems using the model.
        * **Incorrect Predictions/Decisions:** The model may be designed to produce biased or incorrect predictions, leading to flawed decision-making in applications relying on it.
    * **Altered Model Metadata:** Even if the model itself isn't malicious, altering registration parameters can:
        * **Mislead Users:** Incorrect descriptions or tags can mislead users about the model's purpose, origin, or performance.
        * **Cause Confusion/Management Issues:** Incorrect naming or properties can complicate model management and versioning within the Azure ML registry.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * **Input Validation:** The `validate_json` function in `/code/code/utils.py` and schemas defined in `/code/code/schemas.py` are used to validate the structure and data types of the `parameters_file`. This is implemented in the `main` function of `/code/code/main.py` before using the parameters.
    * **Schema Enforcement:** The `parameters_schema` in `/code/code/schemas.py` defines the expected structure and data types for the `parameters_file`, limiting the types of inputs the action will accept.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Pull Request Review Process:** There is no enforced pull request review process documented or implemented within the provided files. Code changes, including modifications to the `parameters_file`, could be merged without human inspection.
    * **Workflow Access Controls:** The project lacks explicit workflow access controls to restrict who can approve and merge pull requests. If repository collaborators or maintainers are compromised, they could merge malicious pull requests.
    * **Content Validation of `model_file_name`:** While the `parameters_schema` validates the `model_file_name` as a string, it does not validate the *content* or *source* of the model file itself. The action trusts that the specified `model_file_name` points to a legitimate and safe model.
* Preconditions:
    * The attacker must be able to fork the repository and create a pull request. This is generally possible for public GitHub repositories.
    * The repository must lack proper pull request review processes and workflow access controls, allowing pull requests to be merged without thorough inspection of changes, especially to configuration files like `parameters_file`.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`action.yml`**: Defines `parameters_file` as an input:
    ```yaml
    inputs:
      parameters_file:
        description: "JSON file including the parameters for registering the model."
        required: true
        default: "registermodel.json"
    ```
    This shows that the action relies on the `parameters_file` to control model registration. The default value suggests that the action expects a file named `registermodel.json` in a specific location.
    2. **`main.py`**: Loads and validates `parameters_file`:
    ```python
    parameters_file = os.environ.get("INPUT_PARAMETERS_FILE", default="registermodel.json")
    parameters_file_path = os.path.join(".cloud", ".azure", parameters_file)
    try:
        with open(parameters_file_path) as f:
            parameters = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"::debug::Could not find parameter file in {parameters_file_path}. Please provide a parameter file in your repository if you do not want to use default settings (e.g. .cloud/.azure/registermodel.json).")
        parameters = {}

    # Checking provided parameters
    print("::debug::Checking provided parameters")
    validate_json(
        data=parameters,
        schema=parameters_schema,
        input_name="PARAMETERS_FILE"
    )
    ```
    The code attempts to load the `parameters_file` from the `.cloud/.azure` directory or uses the default if not found. It then uses `validate_json` to validate the loaded parameters against the `parameters_schema`.
    3. **`validate_json` function in `utils.py`**: Performs schema validation:
    ```python
    def validate_json(data, schema, input_name):
        validator = jsonschema.Draft7Validator(schema)
        errors = list(validator.iter_errors(data))
        if len(errors) > 0:
            for error in errors:
                print(f"::error::JSON validation error: {error}")
            raise AMLConfigurationException(f"JSON validation error for '{input_name}'. Provided object does not match schema. Please check the output for more details.")
        else:
            print(f"::debug::JSON validation passed for '{input_name}'. Provided object does match schema.")
    ```
    This function uses `jsonschema` to validate the input `data` against the provided `schema`. While this provides a level of input sanitization by ensuring the `parameters_file` conforms to the defined schema, it does not prevent malicious intent if the attacker crafts a `parameters_file` that is schema-valid but contains malicious configurations. For example, the `model_file_name` is validated as a string, but its content is not checked for malicious code or unexpected behavior.
    4. **Model Registration in `main.py`**: Uses parameters from the loaded file:
    ```python
    if local_model:
        try:
            model = Model.register(
                workspace=ws,
                model_path=model_path, # Path from parameters_file
                model_name=parameters.get("model_name", default_model_name)[:32], # Name from parameters_file
                tags=parameters.get("model_tags", None), # Tags from parameters_file
                properties=parameters.get("model_properties", None), # Properties from parameters_file
                description=parameters.get("model_description", None), # Description from parameters_file
                # ... other parameters ...
            )
        except ...
    ```
    The `Model.register` function directly utilizes parameters loaded from the `parameters_file`, including `model_path`, `model_name`, `model_tags`, `model_properties`, and `model_description`. If an attacker can manipulate these parameters through a pull request, they can control the model registration process.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the `Azure/aml-registermodel` repository on your GitHub account.
    2. **Create a malicious `parameters_file`:** In your forked repository, create or modify the `registermodel.json` file (or whatever file is specified by `parameters_file` input in `action.yml`) within the `.cloud/.azure` directory.  Modify this file to include malicious configurations. For example:
        ```json
        {
          "model_name": "malicious-model",
          "model_file_name": "malicious_model.pkl",
          "model_description": "This is a malicious model registered by an attacker.",
          "model_tags": {
            "malicious": "true",
            "attacker": "your_github_username"
          }
        }
        ```
        You would also need to create a dummy file named `malicious_model.pkl` (it doesn't need to be a real model for this test, an empty file will suffice to demonstrate the registration process). Place this file in the root of your forked repository to simulate a locally hosted "malicious model".
    3. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository, for example, `malicious-pr`.
    4. **Commit and push changes:** Commit the modified `parameters_file` and the dummy `malicious_model.pkl` to your `malicious-pr` branch and push it to your forked repository.
    5. **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your `malicious-pr` branch in your forked repository to the `master` branch of the original `Azure/aml-registermodel` repository.
    6. **Observe the Workflow Execution (if merged):** If a repository maintainer were to mistakenly merge this pull request without proper review, the GitHub Action workflow would automatically trigger.
    7. **Verify Malicious Model Registration in Azure ML:** After the workflow completes (assuming successful merge and execution), check the Azure Machine Learning workspace (configured in the workflow) and verify if a model named `malicious-model` with the description "This is a malicious model registered by an attacker." and tags `malicious: true`, `attacker: your_github_username` has been successfully registered. If the model is registered with these details, it confirms the vulnerability.
