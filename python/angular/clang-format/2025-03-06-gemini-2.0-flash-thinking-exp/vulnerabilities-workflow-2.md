### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Glob Pattern in `--glob` Parameter
* Description:
    - The `clang-format` Node.js module allows users to format code files using the `--glob` option.
    - This option utilizes glob pattern expansion to specify files for formatting.
    - If the input provided to the `--glob` option is not properly sanitized, a malicious user can inject shell commands within the glob pattern.
    - When the module executes `clang-format` on the expanded file paths, these injected commands will be executed by the system shell.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious glob pattern containing shell commands, for example: `testproject/\`touch injected.txt\`` or `test*'; touch injected.txt; '`.
        2. The attacker executes the `clang-format` command with the crafted `--glob` option: `$ clang-format --glob='testproject/\`touch injected.txt\`'` or `$ clang-format --glob="test*'; touch injected.txt; '"`.
        3. The glob pattern is expanded, potentially using a library like `node-glob` or directly by the shell.
        4. Due to lack of sanitization, the injected shell command (e.g., `touch injected.txt`) is passed to the system shell during glob expansion or when constructing the command to execute `clang-format`.
        5. The system shell executes the injected command, leading to arbitrary command execution. For example, creating a file named `injected.txt` in the `testproject` or current directory.

* Impact:
    - **Critical** - Command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or the user's machine running the `clang-format` module.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Attacker can read sensitive files.
        - System compromise: Attacker can gain full control of the system.
        - Denial of Service: Attacker can crash the system or consume resources.
        - Code modification: Attacker can modify application code or data.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided files. The `README.md` documents the `--glob` option without any security warnings or input sanitization recommendations. The `test.sh` includes a test case for the `glob` option, but it does not test for malicious input or command injection. The `build.sh` script is related to building the `clang-format` binary itself and does not address this vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The module should sanitize the input provided to the `--glob` option to prevent shell command injection. This could involve:
        - Validating the input to ensure it only contains valid glob pattern characters and does not include shell command separators or operators.
        - Using a safer method for file path expansion that does not involve directly passing user input to a shell, if possible.
        - Escaping shell-sensitive characters in the glob pattern before passing it to the shell.
    - **Secure glob expansion:** Instead of relying on shell expansion, the module should use a dedicated library for glob pattern matching that does not involve shell execution, such as the `glob` package in Node.js, and ensure it's used in a way that avoids command injection.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** The process running `clang-format` should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control the input to the `clang-format` command, specifically the `--glob` option. This can be through direct command-line input, configuration files, or indirectly through other input mechanisms in applications using this module.
    - The `clang-format` module must process the `--glob` parameter by directly passing it to a shell for glob expansion without sufficient sanitization.
    - The `clang-format` module must be installed and executable in the attacker's environment or a vulnerable server environment.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **Assumed Vulnerable Code in `index.js` (Conceptual):**
        ```javascript
        const childProcess = require('child_process');
        const glob = require('glob');

        module.exports = function clangFormat(options) {
            let files = options.files || [];
            if (options.glob) {
                files = glob.sync(options.glob); // Potential command injection if options.glob is malicious
            }

            for (const file of files) {
                const command = `clang-format -i ${file}`; // Potential command injection during file expansion or here if file contains malicious chars due to glob
                childProcess.execSync(command); // Executes command with shell
            }
            // ... rest of the logic
        };
        ```
    - **Vulnerable Code Scenario (Conceptual for Glob Expansion via Shell):**
        ```javascript
        const childProcess = require('child_process');
        const processGlob = (globPattern) => {
            // Vulnerable code: Directly using shell to expand glob pattern
            const command = `clang-format ${globPattern}`;
            childProcess.execSync(command);
        };

        const globArg = process.argv.find(arg => arg.startsWith('--glob='));
        if (globArg) {
            const globPattern = globArg.split('=')[1];
            processGlob(globPattern); // Passing unsanitized globPattern to shell
        }
        ```
    - **Explanation:**
        - The code snippets (conceptual) show two potential vulnerable scenarios. The first scenario shows how the `glob` library could be misused leading to injection during file processing. The second scenario illustrates direct shell expansion of the glob pattern leading to immediate command injection.
        - `glob.sync(options.glob)`: This line uses the `glob` library to find files matching the provided pattern. If `options.glob` contains malicious shell commands, `node-glob` itself might not execute them, but the expanded file paths could be crafted to include shell commands.
        - `childProcess.execSync(command)`:  This line executes the `clang-format` command using `childProcess.execSync`, which runs a command in a shell. If the `file` variable (obtained from the potentially malicious glob pattern) or the `globPattern` itself contains shell-injected commands, these commands will be executed by the shell when `clang-format` is invoked.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The lack of sanitization of `options.glob` before passing it to `glob.sync` or directly to shell, and the subsequent use of potentially attacker-controlled file paths or glob patterns in `childProcess.execSync` leads to command injection.

    - **Visualization of vulnerable flow (Shell Glob Expansion):**

    ```
    User Input (malicious glob) --> --glob Parameter --> index.js --> processGlob() --> Shell Command Construction (vulnerable) --> childProcess.execSync() --> Command Execution (vulnerability!)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    - **Pre-requisites:**
        1. Install the `clang-format` module globally: `npm install -g clang-format`
        2. Create a test project directory: `mkdir testproject && cd testproject`
        3. Initialize npm project: `npm init -y` (optional)
        4. Create a dummy javascript file: `touch test.js` (optional)

    - **Steps (for `node-glob` scenario):**
        1. Execute the `clang-format` command with a malicious glob pattern designed to create a file named `INJECTED` in the `testproject` directory:
           ```sh
           clang-format --glob='testproject/\`touch INJECTED\`'
           ```
        2. Check if the file `INJECTED` exists in the `testproject` directory:
           ```sh
           ls testproject/
           ```
        3. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the `ls` command will show the `INJECTED` file in the `testproject` directory.

    - **Steps (for Shell Glob Expansion scenario):**
        1. Execute the `clang-format` command with a malicious glob pattern designed to create a file named `injected.txt` in the current working directory:
           ```bash
           clang-format --glob="test*'; touch injected.txt; '"
           ```
        2. Check if the file `injected.txt` exists in the current directory:
           ```sh
           ls
           ```
        3. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the `ls` command will show the `injected.txt` file in the current directory. This indicates that the `touch injected.txt` command was successfully executed due to command injection. If the vulnerability is mitigated, the `injected.txt` file will not be present.

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Filenames in Git Pre-commit Hooks
* Description:
    1. A developer configures `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` as a git pre-commit hook, as suggested in the project's README.md.
    2. An attacker gains access to the git repository (e.g., by contributing to an open-source project or through other means).
    3. The attacker creates a file with a maliciously crafted filename designed to inject commands when processed by a shell. For example, a filename could be: `'file.js; touch injected.txt'`.
    4. The attacker stages this malicious file using `git add`.
    5. When a developer attempts to commit changes using `git commit`, the pre-commit hook script (`check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format`) is automatically executed.
    6. These Python scripts, in their role as pre-commit hooks, process the staged filenames to determine which files need to be checked or formatted by `clang-format`.
    7. If the scripts naively pass these filenames to a shell command (e.g., using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` or string concatenation) without proper sanitization, the shell will interpret the malicious filename.
    8. The shell will execute `clang-format` with the intended filename part, but also execute the injected command part (e.g., `touch injected.txt`).
    9. This results in arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, triggered by simply attempting to commit code changes.
* Impact:
    * **High** - Arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine.
    * Potential for sensitive data exfiltration from the developer's environment.
    * Installation of malware or backdoors on the developer's system.
    * Unauthorized modification or deletion of files on the developer's machine.
    * Compromise of developer's credentials or environment variables if accessed by injected code.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None identified in the provided project files or documentation. The project relies on external Python scripts (`check-clang-format`, `git-clang-format`) for pre-commit checks, and there is no indication of input sanitization within the provided files.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Filename Sanitization:** The `check-clang-format` and `git-clang-format` scripts must sanitize filenames before using them in shell commands. This should include:
        * Using shell quoting to properly escape special characters in filenames when constructing shell commands.
        * Preferably, using safer methods to execute commands that avoid shell interpretation altogether, such as passing arguments as a list to `subprocess.Popen` in Python, which bypasses the shell's command parsing and prevents injection.
* Preconditions:
    * A developer must have configured `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` as a git pre-commit hook in their local git repository. This is a common practice recommended by the project for code formatting checks.
    * An attacker needs to be able to introduce a file with a malicious filename into the git repository. This could happen through various collaboration scenarios or if the attacker has write access to the repository.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided project files do not include the source code for `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` Python scripts.
    * Based on the vulnerability description and common practices for such scripts, it's assumed that these scripts:
        1. Retrieve a list of filenames that are staged for commit (likely using `git diff --name-only --cached`).
        2. Iterate through these filenames.
        3. For each filename, construct a command to execute `clang-format` (or `check-clang-format`) on that file.
        4. Execute this command using a Python mechanism like `subprocess.Popen`.
    * **Vulnerable Code Scenario (Hypothetical Python Snippet in `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format`):**
      ```python
      import subprocess
      import sys

      def check_formatting(filenames):
          for filename in filenames:
              command = "clang-format " + filename # Vulnerable: Filename is directly concatenated
              try:
                  subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True) # shell=True exacerbates the vulnerability
              except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                  print(f"Formatting check failed for {filename}: {e.stderr.decode()}")
                  sys.exit(1)

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          staged_files = # ... (code to get staged filenames from git, e.g., using git command) ...
          check_formatting(staged_files)
      ```
    * In this vulnerable scenario, if a filename like `'test.js; touch injected.txt'` is processed, the shell command becomes: `clang-format test.js; touch injected.txt`. The shell will execute `clang-format test.js` and then execute `touch injected.txt`.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Ensure `clang-format` and the `clang-format` npm package are installed (globally or locally in a test project).
        * Create a new git repository or use an existing one where you can safely test.
        * Configure a pre-commit hook in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (or using `husky` as described in README.md) that executes `check-clang-format` (you may need to create a dummy `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` Python script that simulates the vulnerable behavior).
    2. **Create Malicious File:**
        * Create a file with a malicious filename in the repository: `touch $'test.js; touch injected_file.txt'`.  Using `$''` ensures special characters are interpreted correctly.
    3. **Stage the Malicious File:**
        * `git add $'test.js; touch injected_file.txt'`
    4. **Attempt Commit:**
        * `git commit -m "Test commit with malicious filename"`
    5. **Verify Injection:**
        * After the `git commit` command is executed, check if the file `injected_file.txt` has been created in the repository directory.
        * If `injected_file.txt` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful during the pre-commit hook execution.
