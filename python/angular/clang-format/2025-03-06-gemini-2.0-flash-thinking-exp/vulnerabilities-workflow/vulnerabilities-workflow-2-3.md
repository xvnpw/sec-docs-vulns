### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Filenames in Git Pre-commit Hooks
* Description:
    1. A developer configures `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` as a git pre-commit hook, as suggested in the project's README.md.
    2. An attacker gains access to the git repository (e.g., by contributing to an open-source project or through other means).
    3. The attacker creates a file with a maliciously crafted filename designed to inject commands when processed by a shell. For example, a filename could be: `'file.js; touch injected.txt'`.
    4. The attacker stages this malicious file using `git add`.
    5. When a developer attempts to commit changes using `git commit`, the pre-commit hook script (`check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format`) is automatically executed.
    6. These Python scripts, in their role as pre-commit hooks, process the staged filenames to determine which files need to be checked or formatted by `clang-format`.
    7. If the scripts naively pass these filenames to a shell command (e.g., using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` or string concatenation) without proper sanitization, the shell will interpret the malicious filename.
    8. The shell will execute `clang-format` with the intended filename part, but also execute the injected command part (e.g., `touch injected.txt`).
    9. This results in arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, triggered by simply attempting to commit code changes.
* Impact:
    * Arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine.
    * Potential for sensitive data exfiltration from the developer's environment.
    * Installation of malware or backdoors on the developer's system.
    * Unauthorized modification or deletion of files on the developer's machine.
    * Compromise of developer's credentials or environment variables if accessed by injected code.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None identified in the provided project files or documentation. The project relies on external Python scripts (`check-clang-format`, `git-clang-format`) for pre-commit checks, and there is no indication of input sanitization within the provided files.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Filename Sanitization:** The `check-clang-format` and `git-clang-format` scripts must sanitize filenames before using them in shell commands. This should include:
        * Using shell quoting to properly escape special characters in filenames when constructing shell commands.
        * Preferably, using safer methods to execute commands that avoid shell interpretation altogether, such as passing arguments as a list to `subprocess.Popen` in Python, which bypasses the shell's command parsing and prevents injection.
* Preconditions:
    * A developer must have configured `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` as a git pre-commit hook in their local git repository. This is a common practice recommended by the project for code formatting checks.
    * An attacker needs to be able to introduce a file with a malicious filename into the git repository. This could happen through various collaboration scenarios or if the attacker has write access to the repository.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided project files do not include the source code for `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` Python scripts.
    * Based on the vulnerability description and common practices for such scripts, it's assumed that these scripts:
        1. Retrieve a list of filenames that are staged for commit (likely using `git diff --name-only --cached`).
        2. Iterate through these filenames.
        3. For each filename, construct a command to execute `clang-format` (or `check-clang-format`) on that file.
        4. Execute this command using a Python mechanism like `subprocess.Popen`.
    * **Vulnerable Code Scenario (Hypothetical Python Snippet in `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format`):**
      ```python
      import subprocess
      import sys

      def check_formatting(filenames):
          for filename in filenames:
              command = "clang-format " + filename # Vulnerable: Filename is directly concatenated
              try:
                  subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True) # shell=True exacerbates the vulnerability
              except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                  print(f"Formatting check failed for {filename}: {e.stderr.decode()}")
                  sys.exit(1)

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          staged_files = # ... (code to get staged filenames from git, e.g., using git command) ...
          check_formatting(staged_files)
      ```
    * In this vulnerable scenario, if a filename like `'test.js; touch injected.txt'` is processed, the shell command becomes: `clang-format test.js; touch injected.txt`. The shell will execute `clang-format test.js` and then execute `touch injected.txt`.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Ensure `clang-format` and the `clang-format` npm package are installed (globally or locally in a test project).
        * Create a new git repository or use an existing one where you can safely test.
        * Configure a pre-commit hook in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (or using `husky` as described in README.md) that executes `check-clang-format` (you may need to create a dummy `check-clang-format` or `git-clang-format` Python script that simulates the vulnerable behavior if the actual scripts are not easily accessible for testing, or if you want to isolate the test). A simplified dummy script could be used for testing the injection:
          ```python
          #!/usr/bin/env python3
          import subprocess
          import sys
          import os

          filenames = sys.argv[1:]
          for filename in filenames:
              command = "touch " + filename  # Simulate command execution with filename
              print(f"Executing: {command}") # Output the command for verification
              subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=False, capture_output=True)

          print("Pre-commit hook finished.")
          ```
          Make this script executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
    2. **Create Malicious File:**
        * Create a file with a malicious filename in the repository: `touch $'test.js; touch injected_file.txt'`.  Using `$''` ensures special characters are interpreted correctly.
    3. **Stage the Malicious File:**
        * `git add $'test.js; touch injected_file.txt'`
    4. **Attempt Commit:**
        * `git commit -m "Test commit with malicious filename"`
    5. **Verify Injection:**
        * After the `git commit` command is executed, check if the file `injected_file.txt` has been created in the repository directory.
        * If `injected_file.txt` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful during the pre-commit hook execution.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious filename can lead to command injection when processed by a vulnerable pre-commit hook script.
