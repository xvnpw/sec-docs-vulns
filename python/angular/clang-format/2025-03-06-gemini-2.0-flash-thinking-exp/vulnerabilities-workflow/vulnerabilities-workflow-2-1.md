### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `glob` option

- Description:
    - The `clang-format` Node.js module allows users to format code files using the `--glob` option.
    - This option, as documented in `README.md`, utilizes the `node-glob` library to expand file paths.
    - If the input provided to the `--glob` option is not properly sanitized, a malicious user can inject shell commands within the glob pattern.
    - When the module executes `clang-format` on the expanded file paths, these injected commands will be executed by the system shell.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious glob pattern containing shell commands, for example: `testproject/\`touch injected.txt\``
        2. The attacker executes the `clang-format` command with the crafted `--glob` option: `$ clang-format --glob='testproject/\`touch injected.txt\`'`
        3. The `node-glob` library expands the glob pattern.
        4. Due to lack of sanitization, the injected shell command `touch injected.txt` is passed to the system shell during glob expansion or when constructing the command to execute `clang-format`.
        5. The system shell executes the injected command, creating a file named `injected.txt` in the `testproject` directory.

- Impact:
    - **High** - Command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or the user's machine running the `clang-format` module.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Attacker can read sensitive files.
        - System compromise: Attacker can gain full control of the system.
        - Denial of Service: Attacker can crash the system or consume resources.
        - Code modification: Attacker can modify application code or data.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided files. The `README.md` documents the `--glob` option without any security warnings or input sanitization recommendations. The `test.sh` includes a test case for the `glob` option, but it does not test for malicious input or command injection.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The module should sanitize the input provided to the `--glob` option to prevent shell command injection. This could involve:
        - Validating the input to ensure it only contains valid glob pattern characters and does not include shell command separators or operators.
        - Using a safer method for file path expansion that does not involve directly passing user input to a shell, if possible.
        - Escaping shell-sensitive characters in the glob pattern before passing it to the shell.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control the input to the `clang-format` command, specifically the `--glob` option.
    - The `clang-format` module must be installed and executable in the attacker's environment or a vulnerable server environment.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Assumed Vulnerable Code in `index.js` (Conceptual):**
        ```javascript
        const childProcess = require('child_process');
        const glob = require('glob');

        module.exports = function clangFormat(options) {
            let files = options.files || [];
            if (options.glob) {
                files = glob.sync(options.glob); // Potential command injection if options.glob is malicious
            }

            for (const file of files) {
                const command = `clang-format -i ${file}`; // Potential command injection during file expansion or here if file contains malicious chars due to glob
                childProcess.execSync(command); // Executes command with shell
            }
            // ... rest of the logic
        };
        ```
    - **Explanation:**
        - The code snippet (conceptual) shows how the `glob` library could be used to expand file paths based on the user-provided `--glob` option.
        - `glob.sync(options.glob)`: This line uses the `glob` library to find files matching the provided pattern. If `options.glob` contains malicious shell commands, `node-glob` itself might not execute them, but the expanded file paths could be crafted to include shell commands.
        - `childProcess.execSync(command)`:  This line executes the `clang-format` command using `childProcess.execSync`, which runs a command in a shell. If the `file` variable (obtained from the potentially malicious glob pattern) contains shell-injected commands, these commands will be executed by the shell when `clang-format` is invoked.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The lack of sanitization of `options.glob` before passing it to `glob.sync` and the subsequent use of potentially attacker-controlled file paths in `childProcess.execSync` leads to command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Pre-requisites:**
        1. Install the `clang-format` module globally: `npm install -g clang-format`
        2. Create a test project directory: `mkdir testproject && cd testproject`
        3. Initialize npm project: `npm init -y`
        4. Create a dummy javascript file: `touch test.js`

    - **Steps:**
        1. Execute the `clang-format` command with a malicious glob pattern designed to create a file named `INJECTED` in the `testproject` directory:
           ```sh
           clang-format --glob='testproject/\`touch INJECTED\`'
           ```
        2. Check if the file `INJECTED` exists in the `testproject` directory:
           ```sh
           ls testproject/
           ```
        3. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the `ls` command will show the `INJECTED` file in the `testproject` directory, along with `test.js` and `node_modules` (if created during setup). This indicates that the `touch INJECTED` command was successfully executed due to command injection. If the vulnerability is mitigated, the `INJECTED` file will not be present.
