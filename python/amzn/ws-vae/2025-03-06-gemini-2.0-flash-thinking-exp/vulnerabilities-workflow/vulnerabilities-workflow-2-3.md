- vulnerability name: Path Traversal in `load_wrench_data` function
- description: The `load_wrench_data` function in `src/var_logger.py` is vulnerable to path traversal. This function takes a `load_path` argument, which is directly passed to the `load_json` function. The `load_json` function then uses the `open()` function to open the file specified by `load_path` without any sanitization or validation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `load_path` that includes path traversal sequences like `../` to access files and directories outside of the intended data directory.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
    1. Identify a way to control the `load_path` parameter that is passed to the `load_wrench_data` function. This could be through a user-supplied input field, a configuration file, or command-line arguments if the application exposes this functionality to users.
    2. Craft a malicious `load_path` string that contains path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`). This path is designed to navigate out of the expected data directories and target sensitive files elsewhere on the file system.
    3. Provide this malicious `load_path` to the application in a way that it gets processed by the `load_wrench_data` function.
    4. The `load_wrench_data` function will pass this path to `load_json`, which in turn will use `open()` to attempt to open the file at the attacker-specified location.
    5. If successful, the attacker will be able to read the content of the targeted file, even if it is outside the intended data directory, because the path traversal sequences were followed by the `open()` function.
- impact: A successful path traversal attack can allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could include sensitive information such as:
    - Configuration files containing passwords, API keys, or database credentials.
    - Source code, potentially revealing intellectual property or further vulnerabilities.
    - User data, leading to privacy breaches and potential identity theft.
    - System files, which in some cases could aid in further system compromise.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly uses the user-provided path without any validation or sanitization.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement checks on the `load_path` in the `load_wrench_data` and `load_json` functions to ensure it does not contain path traversal sequences (like `../` or `./`).
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize the `load_path` to remove any path traversal sequences before using it to open files.
    - Restricting file access:  Implement restrictions to ensure that the application only has access to the necessary directories and files, following the principle of least privilege.
    - Using safe file path handling: Employ secure file path handling mechanisms provided by the operating system or libraries to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, such as using functions that resolve paths to canonical forms and validate against a whitelist of allowed directories.
- preconditions:
    - The application must allow user-controlled input to influence the `load_path` parameter of the `load_wrench_data` function. This could be through a publicly accessible API endpoint, a command-line interface, or a configuration setting that can be manipulated by an attacker.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the file system structure to craft a malicious path that targets valuable files. However, common files like `/etc/passwd` are often targeted in path traversal attacks.
- source code analysis:
    1. The `load_wrench_data` function is defined in `/code/src/var_logger.py`. It takes `load_path` as an argument, which is intended to be the path to a JSON data file.
    ```python
    def load_wrench_data(load_path):
        data = load_json(load_path)
        ...
    ```
    2. Inside `load_wrench_data`, the `load_path` is directly passed to the `load_json` function without any validation or sanitization.
    ```python
    def load_json(load_path):
        f = open(load_path, ) # Vulnerable line
        data = json.load(f)
        f.close()
        return data
    ```
    3. The `load_json` function opens the file using `open(load_path, )`. The `open()` function in Python, by default, will follow path traversal sequences in the provided path. If `load_path` contains sequences like `../`, it will navigate up the directory tree.
    4. There are no checks within `load_json` or `load_wrench_data` to validate or sanitize the `load_path`. This means if an attacker can control the `load_path`, they can cause the `open()` function to access files outside the intended directory.

- security test case:
    1. Create a test file named `test_passwd` with the content of a typical `/etc/passwd` file or any other sensitive content in the root directory of the project or an accessible location.
    2. Modify the `bin/run_ws_vae.py` or another script that uses `load_wrench_data` to accept a command line argument for the dataset path, or directly modify the `dataset_path` variable within the script to be user-controlled for testing purposes.
    3. Run the script, providing a crafted `dataset_path` that attempts path traversal. For example, if the script expects data in a `data` subdirectory, use a path like `'../../test_passwd'` (assuming `test_passwd` is in the project root, two levels up from the expected `data` directory).
    4. Execute the script with the modified `dataset_path`.
    ```bash
    python bin/run_ws_vae.py --dataset_path '../../test_passwd' # Example command if script is modified to accept dataset_path argument
    ```
    5. Observe the output and behavior of the script. If the script successfully reads and attempts to process the content of `test_passwd` (which is intended to simulate reading `/etc/passwd`), instead of a valid JSON data file, and potentially throws errors related to JSON parsing or data format, it indicates that the path traversal was successful and the file `test_passwd` was indeed opened by `load_json`.
    6. To further confirm, you can modify the `load_json` function temporarily for testing to print the file content after reading:
    ```python
    def load_json(load_path):
        f = open(load_path, 'r') # open in read mode
        data_content = f.read()
        print("File Content:\n", data_content) # Print the content for debugging
        f.seek(0) # Reset file pointer to the beginning
        data = json.load(f)
        f.close()
        return data
    ```
    Run the test again. If the content of `test_passwd` (or your sensitive test file) is printed to the console, it definitively proves that the path traversal vulnerability exists, as the code was able to read a file outside of the intended data directory by using the crafted path.
