Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you would like me to update. I need the list of vulnerabilities to be able to filter them based on your instructions and return the updated list in markdown format.

Once you provide the list, I will process it according to your instructions:

1.  **Inclusion Criteria:** I will ensure each vulnerability is valid and part of the described attack vector (buffer overflow exploitation in C utilities for EC2 ENA management, leading to arbitrary code execution).
2.  **Exclusion Criteria:** I will exclude vulnerabilities that:
    *   Only lack documentation for mitigation.
    *   Are denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Are not realistically exploitable in the real world.
    *   Are incompletely described (missing source code analysis or security test case).
    *   Are purely theoretical (lacking exploit evidence in source code analysis).
    *   Are not of high or critical severity.
3.  **Output Formatting:**
    *   If, after filtering, no vulnerabilities remain, I will return an empty list.
    *   If there are vulnerabilities that meet the criteria, I will return a markdown list containing each vulnerability.
    *   For each included vulnerability, I will keep all the original descriptive fields: `vulnerability name`, `description`, `impact`, `vulnerability rank`, `currently implemented mitigations`, `missing mitigations`, `preconditions`, `source code analysis`, and `security test case`.

**Looking forward to receiving the vulnerability list so I can process it for you!**
