### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `check-ena-express-settings.sh`
- Description:
    1. The script `check-ena-express-settings.sh` takes an interface name as a command-line argument.
    2. This interface name is directly used in shell commands without proper sanitization, specifically in `ip link show ${interface}` and `${ethtool} -g ${interface}`.
    3. An attacker with local access to the EC2 instance could execute this script with a maliciously crafted interface name containing shell commands.
    4. For example, an attacker could execute the script with an interface name like `; id > /tmp/output`.
    5. When the script executes `ip link show ${interface}` it will become `ip link show ; id > /tmp/output` leading to execution of `id > /tmp/output`.
    6. This allows arbitrary shell command execution with the privileges of the user running the script.
- Impact:
    - Impact is high because if the script is run with elevated privileges (e.g., via sudo, which is likely for network configuration scripts), an attacker could achieve privilege escalation to root.
    - Successful exploitation allows arbitrary command execution on the EC2 instance.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script directly uses the user-supplied input in shell commands without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The script should sanitize the interface name input to prevent shell command injection. This could involve using parameter expansion like `${1@Q}` in bash to quote the input, or using safer alternatives to shell command execution when possible.
    - Input validation: Validate that the interface name is a valid network interface name before using it in commands.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs local access to an EC2 instance where `check-ena-express-settings.sh` is present.
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `check-ena-express-settings.sh` script, potentially with elevated privileges (e.g., via sudo).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```bash
    check_eth_mtu() {
      local interface=${1}
      local mtu=$(ip link show ${interface} | awk '{print $5}') # Vulnerable line
      ...
    }

    check_eth_rx_queue_size() {
      local interface=${1}
      local rx_queue_size=$(${ethtool} -g ${interface} | grep "RX:" | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}') # Vulnerable line
      ...
    }
    ```
    - The `interface` variable, which is directly derived from the script's command-line argument `${1}`, is used without sanitization in command substitution within `check_eth_mtu` and `check_eth_rx_queue_size` functions.
    - This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed as part of these shell commands.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Log in to an EC2 instance where `check-ena-express-settings.sh` script is located.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
    3. Execute the script with a malicious interface name to inject a command, for example:
       ```bash
       sudo ./check-ena-express-settings.sh "; touch /tmp/pwned"
       ```
    4. Check if the injected command was executed. In this case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created:
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned
       ```
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the vulnerability is confirmed. If the script is run as root (via `sudo`), the file will be created with root privileges, demonstrating potential privilege escalation.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure File Handling in `ena-dts/tools/setup.py` and `ena-dts/framework/dts.py`
- Description:
    1. The `setup.py` script writes configuration data to files like `DTS_CRBS_CFG`, `DTS_EXEC_CFG`, `DTS_IXIA_CFG`, and `DTS_PORTS_CFG`.
    2. The `dts.py` framework and potentially other scripts might read and process these configuration files.
    3. If these configuration files are created in world-writable directories (like `/tmp` or user's home directory if not properly handled), or if file permissions are not correctly set, other users on the EC2 instance could potentially modify these files.
    4. If an attacker modifies these configuration files to point to malicious resources (e.g., compromised repositories, malicious patches, or altered execution paths), or inject malicious data, it could compromise the DTS execution environment.
    5. For example, an attacker could modify `execution.cfg` to point to a malicious DPDK repository or alter patch paths, leading to the download and application of malicious code during the setup process.
- Impact:
    - Impact is medium to high. If configuration files are insecurely handled, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the DTS setup process or alter the execution flow.
    - Depending on the specific vulnerability introduced via file modification, this could lead to privilege escalation (if setup scripts are run with elevated privileges) or other forms of compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium-High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident in the provided code related to secure file handling. The scripts create and write to configuration files without explicit permission checks or secure file creation practices.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure file creation: Ensure configuration files are created with restrictive permissions (e.g., `0600` or `0640`) to prevent unauthorized modification.
    - Secure file paths: Create configuration files in directories with appropriate access controls and avoid world-writable directories.
    - Integrity checks: Implement integrity checks for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications before they are used by the DTS framework.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs local access to the EC2 instance and must be able to identify the location of configuration files created by `setup.py` (e.g., by observing script execution or analyzing the source code).
    - The attacker must have write access to the directory where these configuration files are created.
    - The `setup.py` or `dts.py` scripts must be subsequently executed to trigger the vulnerability by using the modified configuration files.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def write_crbs_cfg():
        ...
        with open(DTS_CRBS_CFG, "w") as f: # Insecure file creation - default permissions
            f.write(content)

    def write_exec_cfg():
        ...
        with open(DTS_EXEC_CFG, "w") as f: # Insecure file creation - default permissions
            f.write(content)

    def write_ixia_cfg():
        ...
        with open(DTS_IXIA_CFG, "w") as f: # Insecure file creation - default permissions
            f.write(content)

    def write_ports_cfg():
        ...
        with open(DTS_PORTS_CFG, "w") as f: # Insecure file creation - default permissions
            f.write(content)
    ```
    - The `write_*_cfg` functions in `setup.py` use `open(..., "w")` to create configuration files. This by default creates files with permissions based on the user's `umask`, which might not be restrictive enough, especially if the script is run with elevated privileges or in shared environments.
    - The lack of explicit permission setting during file creation is a potential security risk.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Log in to an EC2 instance where `ena-dts` project is located as a non-privileged user (user1).
    2. Navigate to the `ena-dts/` directory.
    3. Execute `tools/setup.py` as a privileged user (e.g., using sudo):
       ```bash
       sudo ./tools/setup.py
       ```
    4. Identify the configuration files created by `setup.py`, e.g., `conf/crbs.cfg`, `execution.cfg` (the exact paths may depend on the script's execution and environment).
    5. As the non-privileged user (user1), attempt to modify one of these configuration files, for example, `conf/crbs.cfg`:
       ```bash
       echo "[malicious_setup]" >> conf/crbs.cfg
       echo "dut_ip=127.0.0.1; touch /tmp/pwned_cfg_file" >> conf/crbs.cfg
       ```
    6. If modification is successful (no permission errors), it indicates a potential insecure file handling vulnerability.
    7. Execute `dts` (or another script that uses these config files) as a privileged user:
       ```bash
       sudo ./dts
       ```
    8. Check if the injected command (in this example, `touch /tmp/pwned_cfg_file`) was executed. Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned_cfg_file` was created:
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned_cfg_file
       ```
    9. If `/tmp/pwned_cfg_file` exists (and especially if created with root privileges if `dts` was run with sudo), it confirms that a non-privileged user could modify the configuration files and potentially influence privileged script execution.
