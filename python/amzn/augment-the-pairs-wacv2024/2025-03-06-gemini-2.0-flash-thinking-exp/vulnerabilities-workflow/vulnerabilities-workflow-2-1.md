- Vulnerability Name: Incorrect caption modification when both "left" and "right" keywords are present
- Description:
    1. The `text_conditioned_hflip.py` script contains logic to modify captions during horizontal flipping to maintain semantic consistency, specifically for descriptions involving "left" and "right".
    2. The function `find_and_replace_left_right` is designed to replace "left" keywords with "right" and vice versa.
    3. If a caption contains both "left" and "right" related keywords (as defined in `left_right_dict`) in the same phrase or sentence, the `find_and_replace_left_right` function will only process and replace the first encountered keyword ("left" or "right").
    4. This is because the function iterates through keywords and performs a replacement using `subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)`, which replaces only the first occurrence of the keyword and then breaks the loop, even if other keywords from `left_right_dict` related to opposite directions are present in the same caption.
    5. As a result, in captions containing both "left" and "right" descriptions, only one of them might be modified, leading to semantic inconsistencies between the flipped image and the augmented caption. For example, "a person on the left and right" after horizontal flip might become "a person on the right and right" instead of ideally "a person on the right and left" or similar semantically correct alteration.
- Impact:
    - Training vision and language models with such inconsistently augmented image-caption pairs can lead to the model learning incorrect associations between visual features and language descriptions, specifically regarding spatial relationships like "left" and "right".
    - When a model trained with this augmented data is deployed, it might exhibit reduced accuracy or incorrect grounding when dealing with images and captions involving "left" and "right" descriptions, especially if the input images are horizontally flipped or similar to the augmented training data.
    - This could affect the model's ability to correctly interpret and ground phrases containing spatial relationships, potentially leading to misinterpretations in applications that rely on accurate spatial grounding.
- Vulnerability rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code implements the described logic in `text_conditioned_hflip.py` without any specific checks or mitigations for the case where both "left" and "right" keywords are present in close proximity.
- Missing mitigations:
    - The `find_and_replace_left_right` function needs to be improved to handle cases where both "left" and "right" keywords are present in the same caption more robustly.
    - Ideally, the function should analyze the caption for all relevant "left" and "right" keywords and perform replacements in a way that maintains semantic consistency after horizontal flipping.
    - A possible mitigation could involve:
        - Detecting if both "left" and "right" keywords are present in the caption.
        - If both are detected, implement a more comprehensive replacement strategy that addresses both directions, possibly by replacing all occurrences of "left" keywords with "right" counterparts and vice versa within the relevant phrase or sentence, or by skipping caption modification entirely for such complex cases and relying only on image flipping.
- Preconditions:
    - Horizontal flip augmentation is enabled and applied to an image-caption pair.
    - The caption of the image contains both "left" and "right" keywords from `left_right_dict` (e.g., "left", "right", "leftmost", "rightside") in close proximity within the same phrase or sentence.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/text_conditioned_hflip.py`
    - Function: `find_and_replace_left_right(subcaption)`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The function takes a `subcaption` (part of the original caption) as input.
        2. It checks if the word 'left' is present in the `subcaption` using `if 'left' in subcaption:`.
        3. If 'left' is found, it calls `find_words(subcaption)` to tokenize the subcaption into words.
        4. It iterates through `left_right_dict['left']` (e.g., "left", "leftmost", etc.).
        5. For each `keyword` in `left_right_dict['left']`, it checks if the `keyword` is present in the tokenized `words` of the `subcaption`.
        6. If a `keyword` is found, it constructs `keyword_neg` by replacing 'left' with 'right' in the `keyword`.
        7. It then performs the replacement using `subcaption = subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)`. The `1` here is crucial; it limits the replacement to the first occurrence of `keyword`.
        8. After the first replacement, the `break` statement exits the loop.
        9. If 'left' was not found initially, it checks for 'right' using `elif 'right' in subcaption:`.
        10. If 'right' is found, it performs a similar process, iterating through `left_right_dict['right']` and replacing the first found keyword with its 'left' counterpart, again using `subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)` and breaking after the first replacement.
        11. The function returns the modified `subcaption`.
    - Visualization:
    ```
    find_and_replace_left_right(subcaption="a cat on the left and right side")
    -> checks for 'left' in subcaption: True
    -> words = find_words(subcaption) = ['a', 'cat', 'on', 'the', 'left', 'and', 'right', 'side']
    -> for keyword in left_right_dict['left']:  (keyword = 'left', 'leftmost', ...)
        -> if keyword in words: (keyword = 'left' is found in words)
            -> keyword_neg = keyword.replace('left', 'right') = 'right'
            -> subcaption = subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)  // subcaption becomes "a cat on the right and right side"
            -> break
    -> return subcaption = "a cat on the right and right side"
    ```
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:** Use the provided code in `/code/augmentations.py` and `/code/text_conditioned_hflip.py`. You will need a basic image loading and processing setup (e.g., using PIL and torchvision). For simplicity, you can mock the image and target dictionary.
    2. **Prepare test data:**
        - Create a dummy image (e.g., a black image of size 256x256 using PIL).
        - Create a target dictionary with a caption that includes both "left" and "right" keywords, and dummy bounding boxes and tokens.
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        import torch
        from text_conditioned_hflip import thflip

        image = Image.new('RGB', (256, 256), color = 'black')
        target = {
            'caption': "a cat on the left and right side of the table",
            'boxes': torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40]]), # dummy box
            'tokens_positive': [[(13, 17)], [(22, 32)]] # tokens for "left" and "right side"
        }
        ```
    3. **Apply horizontal flip augmentation:**
        ```python
        flipped_image, augmented_target = thflip(image, target)
        ```
    4. **Inspect the augmented caption:**
        ```python
        augmented_caption = augmented_target['caption']
        print(f"Original caption: {target['caption']}")
        print(f"Augmented caption: {augmented_caption}")
        ```
    5. **Expected result:** The augmented caption should be "a cat on the right and right side of the table". This demonstrates that only "left" was replaced by "right", and "right side" remained unchanged, confirming the vulnerability.
    6. **Run the test:** Execute the Python code.
    7. **Verification:** Observe the output. If the augmented caption is indeed "a cat on the right and right side of the table", the vulnerability is confirmed.
