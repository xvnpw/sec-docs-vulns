### Incomplete Keyword Replacement in Horizontal Flip Augmentation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Incomplete Keyword Replacement in Horizontal Flip Augmentation
- **Description:**
    1. The horizontal flip augmentation in `text_conditioned_hflip.py` aims to maintain semantic consistency between images and captions after horizontal flipping. It achieves this by modifying captions to replace keywords related to "left" and "right" using predefined dictionaries (`left_right_dict`).
    2. The `find_and_replace_left_right` function in `text_conditioned_hflip.py` only replaces the *first* occurrence of a keyword from the dictionary within a subcaption.
    3. If a caption contains multiple keywords related to left/right, or uses variations not covered in the dictionary, the caption might not be fully updated, leading to semantic inconsistencies in the augmented image-caption pairs.
    4. For example, in a caption like "The object on the left is red, and the object on the leftmost is blue", if horizontal flip is applied, only the first "left" might be replaced with "right", resulting in an incorrect caption like "The object on the right is red, and the object on the leftmost is blue".
    5. Another example: If a caption contains both "left" and "right" related keywords (as defined in `left_right_dict`) in the same phrase or sentence, the `find_and_replace_left_right` function will only process and replace the first encountered keyword ("left" or "right"). For example, "a person on the left and right" after horizontal flip might become "a person on the right and right" instead of ideally "a person on the right and left" or similar semantically correct alteration.

- **Impact:**
    - Semantic inconsistencies in augmented data can degrade the performance and reliability of downstream vision and language applications, especially security-sensitive ones.
    - Training vision and language models with such inconsistently augmented image-caption pairs can lead to the model learning incorrect associations between visual features and language descriptions, specifically regarding spatial relationships like "left" and "right".
    - When a model trained with this augmented data is deployed, it might exhibit reduced accuracy or incorrect grounding when dealing with images and captions involving "left" and "right" descriptions, especially if the input images are horizontally flipped or similar to the augmented training data.
    - This could affect the model's ability to correctly interpret and ground phrases containing spatial relationships, potentially leading to misinterpretations in applications that rely on accurate spatial grounding.
    - In security contexts, this could lead to misclassification or bypassing of security filters. For instance, a security filter trained to detect threats on the "left" of images might be circumvented if augmented data incorrectly describes objects as being on the "left" after a horizontal flip, confusing the model.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The code attempts to address caption consistency during horizontal flipping by using a dictionary-based keyword replacement mechanism in `text_conditioned_hflip.py`.
    - The functions `thflip`, `tokens_hflip`, and `find_and_replace_left_right` are involved in this mitigation effort.
    - However, the current implementation in `find_and_replace_left_right` is limited to replacing only the first occurrence of predefined keywords and does not handle cases with both "left" and "right" keywords effectively.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement a more robust keyword replacement logic in `find_and_replace_left_right` to handle multiple occurrences of left/right keywords within a caption or subcaption.
    - The `find_and_replace_left_right` function needs to be improved to handle cases where both "left" and "right" keywords are present in the same caption more robustly.
    - Ideally, the function should analyze the caption for all relevant "left" and "right" keywords and perform replacements in a way that maintains semantic consistency after horizontal flipping.
    - A possible mitigation could involve:
        - Detecting if both "left" and "right" keywords are present in the caption.
        - If both are detected, implement a more comprehensive replacement strategy that addresses both directions, possibly by replacing all occurrences of "left" keywords with "right" counterparts and vice versa within the relevant phrase or sentence, or by skipping caption modification entirely for such complex cases and relying only on image flipping.
    - Expand the `left_right_dict` to include a broader range of synonyms and descriptive terms for "left" and "right" positions to improve coverage and accuracy of caption rewriting.
    - Develop and integrate unit tests specifically for the caption rewriting functionality in `text_conditioned_hflip.py`. These tests should cover various scenarios, including captions with multiple left/right references, complex sentence structures, and edge cases, to ensure the correctness and completeness of the caption modification process.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Horizontal flip augmentation is enabled and applied to an image-caption pair.
    - The user must enable and utilize the horizontal flip augmentation as provided in `text_conditioned_hflip.py`.
    - The input image-caption pairs must have captions that describe spatial relationships involving "left" or "right" positions, which are intended to be modified by the horizontal flipping augmentation.
    - The caption of the image contains multiple "left" and "right" keywords from `left_right_dict` (e.g., "left", "right", "leftmost", "rightside") in close proximity within the same phrase or sentence or multiple occurrences throughout the caption.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/text_conditioned_hflip.py`
    - Function: `find_and_replace_left_right(subcaption)`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The function takes a `subcaption` (part of the original caption) as input.
        2. It checks if the word 'left' is present in the `subcaption` using `if 'left' in subcaption:`.
        3. If 'left' is found, it calls `find_words(subcaption)` to tokenize the subcaption into words.
        4. It iterates through `left_right_dict['left']` (e.g., "left", "leftmost", etc.).
        5. For each `keyword` in `left_right_dict['left']`, it checks if the `keyword` is present in the tokenized `words` of the `subcaption`.
        6. If a `keyword` is found, it constructs `keyword_neg` by replacing 'left' with 'right' in the `keyword`.
        7. It then performs the replacement using `subcaption = subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)`. The `1` here is crucial; it limits the replacement to the first occurrence of `keyword`.
        8. After the first replacement, the `break` statement exits the loop.
        9. If 'left' was not found initially, it checks for 'right' using `elif 'right' in subcaption:`.
        10. If 'right' is found, it performs a similar process, iterating through `left_right_dict['right']` and replacing the first found keyword with its 'left' counterpart, again using `subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)` and breaking after the first replacement.
        11. The function returns the modified `subcaption`.
    - Visualization:
    ```
    find_and_replace_left_right(subcaption="a cat on the left and right side")
    -> checks for 'left' in subcaption: True
    -> words = find_words(subcaption) = ['a', 'cat', 'on', 'the', 'left', 'and', 'right', 'side']
    -> for keyword in left_right_dict['left']:  (keyword = 'left', 'leftmost', ...)
        -> if keyword in words: (keyword = 'left' is found in words)
            -> keyword_neg = keyword.replace('left', 'right') = 'right'
            -> subcaption = subcaption.replace(keyword, keyword_neg, 1)  // subcaption becomes "a cat on the right and right side"
            -> break
    -> return subcaption = "a cat on the right and right side"
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Use the provided code in `/code/augmentations.py` and `/code/text_conditioned_hflip.py`. You will need a basic image loading and processing setup (e.g., using PIL and torchvision). For simplicity, you can mock the image and target dictionary.
    2. **Prepare test data:**
        - Create a dummy image (e.g., a black image of size 256x256 using PIL).
        - Create a target dictionary with a caption that includes multiple "left" and "right" keywords, or multiple occurrences of left/right keywords.
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        import torch
        from text_conditioned_hflip import thflip

        image = Image.new('RGB', (256, 256), color = 'black')
        # Test case 1: Both "left" and "right" keywords
        target1 = {
            'caption': "a cat on the left and right side of the table",
            'boxes': torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40]]), # dummy box
            'tokens_positive': [[(13, 17)], [(22, 32)]] # tokens for "left" and "right side"
        }
        # Test case 2: Multiple "left" related keywords
        target2 = {
            'caption': "The object on the left is red, and the object on the leftmost is blue",
            'boxes': torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40], [60, 70, 80, 90]]), # Dummy boxes
            'tokens_positive': [[[17, 21]], [[41, 49]]] # Tokens for 'left' and 'leftmost'
        }
        ```
    3. **Apply horizontal flip augmentation:**
        ```python
        flipped_image1, augmented_target1 = thflip(image, target1)
        flipped_image2, augmented_target2 = thflip(image, target2)
        ```
    4. **Inspect the augmented caption:**
        ```python
        augmented_caption1 = augmented_target1['caption']
        augmented_caption2 = augmented_target2['caption']
        print(f"Original caption 1: {target1['caption']}")
        print(f"Augmented caption 1: {augmented_caption1}")
        print(f"Original caption 2: {target2['caption']}")
        print(f"Augmented caption 2: {augmented_caption2}")
        ```
    5. **Expected result:**
        - For Test case 1, the augmented caption should be "a cat on the right and right side of the table".
        - For Test case 2, the augmented caption should be "The object on the right is red, and the object on the leftmost is blue".
        This demonstrates that in both cases only the first encountered "left" keyword is replaced, and other "left" or "right" related keywords are not correctly processed, confirming the vulnerability.
    6. **Run the test:** Execute the Python code.
    7. **Verification:** Observe the output. If the augmented captions match the expected results in step 5, the vulnerability is confirmed.
