### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Data Loading
- Description:
    1. The application accepts command-line arguments `--train`, `--test`, and `--dev` to specify paths to training, testing, and development data files respectively.
    2. These file paths are passed to the `get_reader` function in `utils.py`.
    3. The `get_reader` function creates a `CoNLLReader` object, passing the provided file path.
    4. Inside `CoNLLReader`, the `read_data` method is called, which directly uses the provided file path in `gzip.open(data, 'rt')` or `open(data, 'rt')` to open and read the data file.
    5. There is no input sanitization or validation on the file paths before they are used in file operations.
    6. An attacker can provide a malicious file path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) as the value for `--train`, `--test`, or `--dev`.
    7. The application will then attempt to open and read the file at the attacker-specified path, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or other unintended consequences.
- Impact:
    An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the application has permissions to access. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, including configuration files, source code, or other system files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The application directly uses the provided file paths without any sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for file paths: Implement checks to ensure that the provided file paths are valid and within the expected directories. Use functions like `os.path.abspath` to resolve paths and then validate that the resolved path is within a safe or allowed directory.
    - Input validation: Validate that the files are of the expected type and format before attempting to process them.
- Preconditions:
    The attacker must be able to execute the Python scripts (`train_model.py`, `evaluate.py`, `predict_tags.py`, `fine_tune.py`) and control the command-line arguments, specifically `--train`, `--test`, or `--dev`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    # File: /code/utils/utils.py
    def parse_args():
        p = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Model configuration.', add_help=False)
        p.add_argument('--train', type=str, help='Path to the train data.', default=None) # Vulnerable argument
        p.add_argument('--test', type=str, help='Path to the test data.', default=None)  # Vulnerable argument
        p.add_argument('--dev', type=str, help='Path to the dev data.', default=None)   # Vulnerable argument
        # ... other arguments ...
        return p.parse_args()

    def get_reader(file_path, max_instances=-1, max_length=50, target_vocab=None, encoder_model='xlm-roberta-large'):
        if file_path is None:
            return None
        reader = CoNLLReader(max_instances=max_instances, max_length=max_length, target_vocab=target_vocab, encoder_model=encoder_model)
        reader.read_data(file_path) # file_path is passed directly to read_data

        return reader

    # File: /code/utils/reader.py
    class CoNLLReader(Dataset):
        # ...
        def read_data(self, data): # data is the file_path
            dataset_name = data if isinstance(data, str) else 'dataframe'
            logger.info('Reading file {}'.format(dataset_name))
            instance_idx = 0

            for fields, metadata in get_ner_reader(data=data): # file_path is passed directly to get_ner_reader
                # ...

    # File: /code/utils/reader_utils.py
    def get_ner_reader(data): # data is the file_path
        fin = gzip.open(data, 'rt') if data.endswith('.gz') else open(data, 'rt') # Vulnerable file operation - no path sanitization
        for is_divider, lines in itertools.groupby(fin, _is_divider):
            # ...
    ```
    The code flow clearly shows that the file paths provided through command-line arguments `--train`, `--test`, and `--dev` are directly passed to file opening functions (`gzip.open` or `open`) without any validation or sanitization. This allows for path traversal attacks.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the NER baseline project to a test environment.
    2. Create a file named `test_vulnerability.txt` in the root directory of the server with the content "This is a test vulnerability file.".
    3. Execute the `train_model.py` script with a malicious `--train` argument designed to access the `test_vulnerability.txt` file using path traversal:
       ```bash
       python -m ner_baseline.train_model --train '../../test_vulnerability.txt' --dev dev.txt --out_dir output_test --model_name test_vuln_model --epochs 1
       ```
       *(Note: `dev.txt` and `output_test` are placeholder values, and might need to be adjusted based on the project setup. Ensure `dev.txt` exists or provide a valid path, and `output_test` is a writable directory.)*
    4. Observe the application logs or output. If the application attempts to read and process the content of `test_vulnerability.txt` (or throws an error indicating it tried to open the file from the traversed path), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
    5. To further verify, try to access a more sensitive file like `/etc/passwd` (on Linux-like systems) or `C:\Windows\win.ini` (on Windows).
       ```bash
       python -m ner_baseline.train_model --train '../../../../../../etc/passwd' --dev dev.txt --out_dir output_test --model_name test_vuln_model --epochs 1
       ```
    6. If the application attempts to read `/etc/passwd` (which might result in errors during processing due to format mismatch, but the attempt to open is the vulnerability), it confirms the vulnerability is exploitable for reading system files.


- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Model Loading
- Description:
    1. The application accepts a command-line argument `--model` to specify the path to a pre-trained model file.
    2. This file path is passed to the `load_model` function in `utils.py`.
    3. The `load_model` function directly uses the provided file path to load the model using `NERBaseAnnotator.load_from_checkpoint(model_file, ...)`.
    4. While there is a check using `os.path.isfile(model_file)`, this check is insufficient to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, as it only verifies if a file exists at the given path, not whether the path is within an allowed directory.
    5. An attacker can provide a malicious file path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) as the value for `--model`.
    6. The application will then attempt to load a model from the attacker-specified path. Although loading `/etc/passwd` as a model will likely fail, the attempt to access and read the file from an arbitrary path is the vulnerability.  A more practical attack is to read files within the application's directory structure or potentially overwrite files if write permissions are misconfigured (though less likely in the context of model loading).
- Impact:
    An attacker can attempt to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the application has permissions to access. While directly reading sensitive system files as "models" is unlikely to be functional for the application, the ability to control file access paths is a security risk. It could be leveraged in more complex attack scenarios or lead to information disclosure by reading application-related files.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `os.path.isfile(model_file)` check in `load_model` function. This is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for file paths: Implement checks to ensure that the provided model file path is within the expected model directories. Use `os.path.abspath` and validate against allowed paths.
    - Input validation: While less critical for model files than data files in terms of content validation for path traversal, restricting the path to expected model directories is essential.
- Preconditions:
    The attacker must be able to execute the Python scripts (`evaluate.py`, `predict_tags.py`, `fine_tune.py`) and control the command-line argument `--model`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    # File: /code/utils/utils.py
    def parse_args():
        p = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Model configuration.', add_help=False)
        p.add_argument('--model', type=str, help='Model path.', default=None) # Vulnerable argument
        # ... other arguments ...
        return p.parse_args()

    def load_model(model_file, tag_to_id=None, stage='test'):
        if ~os.path.isfile(model_file): # Insecure check - doesn't prevent path traversal
            model_file = get_models_for_evaluation(model_file)

        hparams_file = model_file[:model_file.rindex('checkpoints/')] + '/hparams.yaml'
        model = NERBaseAnnotator.load_from_checkpoint(model_file, hparams_file=hparams_file, stage=stage, tag_to_id=tag_to_id) # Vulnerable file operation - no path sanitization
        model.stage = stage
        return model, model_file
    ```
    The code shows that the `--model` argument is used to load the model file. The `os.path.isfile` check is present, but it only verifies file existence and does not prevent path traversal. The `model_file` path, taken directly from user input, is used in `NERBaseAnnotator.load_from_checkpoint`, which performs file operations based on this path.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the NER baseline project to a test environment.
    2. Create a dummy model file named `dummy_model.ckpt` in the root directory of the server (or any location outside the expected model directories). This file does not need to be a valid model file; its existence is enough for this test case.
    3. Execute the `evaluate.py` script with a malicious `--model` argument designed to access the `dummy_model.ckpt` file using path traversal:
       ```bash
       python -m ner_baseline.evaluate --test test.txt --out_dir output_eval --encoder_model xlm-roberta-base --model '../../dummy_model.ckpt' --prefix test_eval
       ```
       *(Note: `test.txt`, `output_eval`, `xlm-roberta-base`, and `test_eval` are placeholder values and might need adjustment based on the project setup. Ensure `test.txt` exists or provide a valid path, `output_eval` is writable, and `xlm-roberta-base` is a valid encoder model name.)*
    4. Observe if the application attempts to load the model from the path `../../dummy_model.ckpt`. If the application proceeds without errors related to file access (or throws errors later due to invalid model content, but not file access), it suggests the path traversal vulnerability is present.
    5. To further verify, try to access a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd` (on Linux-like systems) or `C:\Windows\win.ini` (on Windows) as the `--model` argument.
       ```bash
       python -m ner_baseline.evaluate --test test.txt --out_dir output_eval --encoder_model xlm-roberta-base --model '../../../../../../etc/passwd' --prefix test_eval
       ```
    6. If the application attempts to access `/etc/passwd` (which will certainly fail as a model file, but the access attempt is the vulnerability), it confirms the path traversal is exploitable. The vulnerability is confirmed if the application attempts to open and read from the traversed path, even if model loading fails later due to file content.
