* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal
* Description:
    1. The application accepts file paths as command-line arguments for training, testing, and development datasets via the `--train`, `--test`, and `--dev` parameters.
    2. These file paths are passed to the `get_reader` function in `utils.py`.
    3. The `get_reader` function initializes a `CoNLLReader` object and calls its `read_data` method, passing the provided file path.
    4. Within the `read_data` method of `CoNLLReader` in `utils/reader.py`, the application calls `get_ner_reader` from `utils/reader_utils.py` with the user-supplied file path.
    5. The `get_ner_reader` function in `utils/reader_utils.py` directly opens the file path using either `gzip.open` or `open` based on the file extension without any validation or sanitization.
    6. By providing a maliciously crafted file path (e.g., using `../` sequences), an attacker can bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the intended data directory. For example, an attacker could provide `--train ../../../etc/passwd` as an argument.
    7. The application will then attempt to open and read the `/etc/passwd` file (or any other file specified by the attacker) from the server's file system.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary file read.
    - An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system that the application user has access to.
    - This could include configuration files, source code, data files, or other sensitive information, potentially leading to information disclosure and further compromise of the system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None.
    - The code directly uses the provided file paths without any input validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of file paths.
    - Implement checks to ensure that the provided file paths are within an expected directory or a set of allowed directories.
    - Sanitize file paths to remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    - Consider using secure file path handling functions provided by the operating system or libraries to prevent traversal vulnerabilities.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute one of the Python scripts (`train_model.py`, `evaluate.py`, `predict_tags.py`, or `fine_tune.py`).
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to these scripts, specifically the `--train`, `--test`, or `--dev` arguments.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. Argument Parsing (`utils.py`, `parse_args`): The `parse_args` function in `utils.py` defines the command-line arguments `--train`, `--test`, and `--dev` as strings using `argparse`. These arguments are intended to receive file paths.
    ```python
    p.add_argument('--train', type=str, help='Path to the train data.', default=None)
    p.add_argument('--test', type=str, help='Path to the test data.', default=None)
    p.add_argument('--dev', type=str, help='Path to the dev data.', default=None)
    ```
    2. Data Reader Initialization and File Path Handling (`utils.py`, `get_reader`): The `get_reader` function takes the `file_path` argument directly from the parsed arguments and passes it to the `CoNLLReader` constructor and subsequently to the `read_data` method.
    ```python
    def get_reader(file_path, max_instances=-1, max_length=50, target_vocab=None, encoder_model='xlm-roberta-large'):
        if file_path is None:
            return None
        reader = CoNLLReader(max_instances=max_instances, max_length=max_length, target_vocab=target_vocab, encoder_model=encoder_model)
        reader.read_data(file_path)
        return reader
    ```
    3. File Opening in `get_ner_reader` (`utils/reader_utils.py`): The `get_ner_reader` function receives the `data` argument (which is the file path) and directly opens the file using either `gzip.open` if the file ends with `.gz` or `open` otherwise. Crucially, no checks are performed on the `data` path to ensure it is safe or within expected boundaries.
    ```python
    def get_ner_reader(data):
        fin = gzip.open(data, 'rt') if data.endswith('.gz') else open(data, 'rt')
        # ... rest of the function ...
    ```
    *Visualization:*
    ```
    [command-line arguments] --> parse_args (utils.py) --> file_path --> get_reader (utils.py) --> CoNLLReader.read_data (utils/reader.py) --> get_ner_reader (utils/reader_utils.py) --> open/gzip.open (utils/reader_utils.py) --> [File Access]
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Assume an attacker has access to execute the `train_model.py` script on a system where the application is deployed.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious command to exploit the path traversal vulnerability. For example, to read the `/etc/passwd` file, the attacker executes the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m ner_baseline.train_model --train "../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" --dev dev.txt --out_dir output_dir --model_name test_model
    ```
    3. Observe the application's behavior. If the vulnerability is present, the application will attempt to open and read the file specified by the path `../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
    4. While the script will likely fail to process `/etc/passwd` as a valid CoNLL format dataset, the attempt to open the file at the attacker-specified path confirms the path traversal vulnerability. Error messages in the logs or console output might indicate an attempt to read from `/etc/passwd` or a failure due to incorrect file format after attempting to open the file.
    5. To further confirm, the attacker can try to read a file that is more likely to be parsed without immediate errors, such as a known data file within the project directory but accessed via a traversal path (e.g., if `dev.txt` is in `/code/data`, try `--train "../data/dev.txt"` when running from `/code`). This can help differentiate between file access attempts and parsing errors.
