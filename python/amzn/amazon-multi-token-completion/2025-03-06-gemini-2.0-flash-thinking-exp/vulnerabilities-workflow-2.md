## Combined Vulnerability List

### Path Traversal Vulnerability in Dataset Loading
- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal Vulnerability in Dataset Loading
- **Description:**
    1. The application uses command-line arguments `--dataset_path` in `test.py`, `--input_path` in `matrix_plugin.py`, and `--input_path` in `mtc_model.py` to specify the path to load datasets from disk using the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function.
    2. These paths are taken directly from user input without sufficient validation or sanitization.
    3. An attacker can manipulate these arguments to include path traversal sequences like `../` to escape the intended directory and access files or directories outside of the project's data directory.
    4. For example, by providing `--dataset_path ../../../../../etc/`, the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function in `test.py` will attempt to load a dataset from the `/etc/` directory, potentially exposing sensitive files if they are in a format that `datasets.load_from_disk()` attempts to read.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the Python process has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or data depending on the server setup and file permissions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses the user-provided paths without any validation or sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Implement checks to ensure that the provided paths are within the expected data directories and do not contain path traversal sequences.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize user-provided paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences before using them in file system operations. For example, using functions to resolve paths to their canonical form and verifying they are within allowed directories.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute the Python scripts (`test.py`, `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py`) and provide command-line arguments. This scenario is likely in research or development environments where users have direct access to run the scripts. In a deployed scenario, if these scripts are exposed through an API or other interface that allows for parameter injection, this vulnerability could be exploited remotely.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: /code/test.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--dataset_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()

        if args.dataset_path is None:
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(f'{HOME_DIR}/MultiTokenCompletionData/input_data_{args.case}')
        else:
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(args.dataset_path) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        - The code uses `argparse` to parse the `--dataset_path` argument.
        - If `--dataset_path` is provided, the `datasets.load_from_disk(args.dataset_path)` function is directly called with the user-supplied path.
        - There is no validation or sanitization of `args.dataset_path` before it's used in `load_from_disk()`.

    - **File: /code/matrix_plugin.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--input_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()

        if args.force or not os.path.exists(model_path) or not os.path.exists(dataset_path):
            if args.input_path is not None:
                input_path = args.input_path # User controlled input_path
            elif ...
                input_path = ...
            ...
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(input_path) # Vulnerable line
        else:
            ...
            seen_dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(dataset_path) # Potentially vulnerable if dataset_path is derived from user input
        ```
        - The code uses `argparse` to parse the `--input_path` argument.
        - If `--input_path` is provided, it's directly assigned to the `input_path` variable.
        - `datasets.load_from_disk(input_path)` is called with this user-controlled `input_path`.
        - Even when `--input_path` is not provided, the `dataset_path` which is used in the `else` block to load dataset might be constructed based on user controlled `model_name` and `dataset_suffix`, which still presents a risk if these are directly derived from user input in other contexts.

    - **File: /code/mtc_model.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument("--input_path", type=str, default=None)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if args.input_path is not None:
            input_path = args.input_path # User controlled input_path
        elif ...
            input_path = ...
        else:
            input_path = ...

        if not os.path.exists(input_path):
            ...
            parse_data(dataset_name, dataset_suffix)

        fs = S3FileSystem() if input_path.startswith('s3://') else None
        input_features = datasets.load_from_disk(input_path, fs=fs) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        - Similar to `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py` also uses `argparse` to get `--input_path`.
        - The `input_path` variable, directly derived from user input, is used in `datasets.load_from_disk(input_path, fs=fs)`.
        - The use of `S3FileSystem` (`fs=fs`) only mitigates against path traversal for S3 paths, not for local file paths. If the `input_path` does not start with `s3://`, it will default to local file system access, and the path traversal vulnerability persists.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Assume you have access to the project code and can execute the `test.py` script.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `/code/` directory of the project.
    3. Execute the `test.py` script with a crafted `--dataset_path` argument to attempt path traversal. For example:
        ```bash
        python test.py --dataset_path "../../../../../etc/"
        ```
    4. Observe the output. If the script attempts to read files from the `/etc/` directory, it indicates a path traversal vulnerability. You might see error messages from `datasets.load_from_disk()` if it tries to process files in `/etc/` as a dataset, or if it encounters permissions issues. If successful in reading a recognizable dataset file (unlikely from `/etc/`), the script might proceed further without immediately crashing, still confirming the vulnerability.
    5. To confirm file reading, you can try to target a known file like `/etc/passwd` (if accessible by the user running the script) and check for error messages that suggest the script tried to access or process this file. Note that `datasets.load_from_disk` expects a specific dataset format, so directly reading `/etc/passwd` as a dataset will likely fail, but the attempt to access the path confirms the vulnerability.
    6. To make the test more conclusive without relying on error messages, you could create a dummy dataset in a known location (e.g., `/tmp/test_dataset`) and then use path traversal to access it via a relative path from outside the intended data directory. For example, if your intended data directory is `/code/data`, and you create `/tmp/test_dataset`, you could try running the script with `--dataset_path "../../../tmp/test_dataset"`. If it successfully loads the dummy dataset, it confirms path traversal.

### Path Traversal in Checkpoint Loading
- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Checkpoint Loading
- **Description:**
    1. The application uses the `--ckpt` command-line argument in `test.py` and `matrix_plugin.py` to specify the path to the checkpoint file.
    2. The application directly passes this user-provided path to `Generation.load_from_checkpoint()` or `MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint()` without any sanitization or validation.
    3. An attacker can manipulate the `--ckpt` argument to include path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate to directories outside the intended checkpoint directory.
    4. If the attacker provides a path to a malicious checkpoint file located outside the project directory, the application will attempt to load it.
    5. If the attacker provides a path to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) instead of a checkpoint file, the `load_from_checkpoint()` function might attempt to read and process it, potentially leading to information disclosure or unexpected errors.
- **Impact:**
    - **High**: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system if the application attempts to load and process arbitrary files provided via the manipulated `--ckpt` argument. In a more severe scenario, depending on the implementation of `load_from_checkpoint` and the libraries it uses, there might be a possibility of writing files to arbitrary locations if the loading process involves saving or extracting data from the provided path. While less likely in this specific context of loading model checkpoints, it's a potential risk depending on the underlying libraries' behavior.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The code directly uses the user-provided path without any validation or sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The application should validate and sanitize the `--ckpt` input path to ensure it is within the expected directory and does not contain path traversal sequences.
    - **Path Restriction**: Restrict the file paths that can be accessed to a specific allowed directory (e.g., the `checkpoints` directory within the project).
    - **Secure File Loading**: Implement secure file loading practices to prevent unexpected behavior when loading files from user-provided paths.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running or accessible to an attacker, allowing them to execute the `test.py` or `matrix_plugin.py` scripts with manipulated command-line arguments.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/test.py`**:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('-c', '--ckpt', type=str)
        # ...
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ckpt = args.ckpt
        print('ckpt:', ckpt)
        if ckpt is None:
            if args.version is not None:
                ckpt = get_ckpt_version(args.version)
                print(f'using {ckpt}')
            else:
                ckpt = get_latest_ckpt()
                print(f'No checkpoint provided taking the latest: {ckpt}')
        # ...
        model = Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt).cuda()
        ```
        The code takes the `--ckpt` argument directly from user input and passes it to `Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt)`. There is no validation or sanitization of the `ckpt` variable before it is used in `load_from_checkpoint`.

    - **File: `/code/matrix_plugin.py`**:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--ckpt', type=str, default=None)
        # ...
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ckpt = args.ckpt
        # ...
        if args.test:
            # ...
            ckpt = args.ckpt
            if ckpt is None:
                from glob import glob
                ckpt = sorted(glob(f'matrix_plugin_results/{args.version}/checkpoints/*.ckpt'))[-1]
            print(ckpt)
            test(matrix, seen_dataset, mapping, tok, ckpt, args.log)
        ```
        Similarly, in `matrix_plugin.py`, the `--ckpt` argument is taken directly and used in `MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt, model=matrix)` without any validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Assume the project is set up and runnable.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
    3. Execute the test script `test.py` with a manipulated `--ckpt` argument to attempt path traversal:
       ```bash
       python code/test.py --ckpt "../../../../../etc/passwd"
       ```
    4. Observe the application's output. If the application attempts to read or process `/etc/passwd` (which might lead to errors or unexpected behavior depending on the `load_from_checkpoint` implementation and file content) or if you can observe file access attempts to `/etc/passwd`, it indicates a path traversal vulnerability.
    5. Similarly, test with `matrix_plugin.py`:
       ```bash
       python code/matrix_plugin.py --test --ckpt "../../../../../etc/passwd"
       ```
    6. Again, observe the output for signs of attempted access or errors related to `/etc/passwd`, confirming the vulnerability.

### Insecure Deserialization in Checkpoint Loading
- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization in Checkpoint Loading
- **Description:**
    - The application utilizes `pytorch_lightning`'s `load_from_checkpoint` function to load model checkpoints from disk.
    - This function internally uses `torch.load` for deserialization of checkpoint files.
    - `torch.load` is known to be vulnerable to insecure deserialization, as it can execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process if the input data is maliciously crafted.
    - An attacker can create a malicious checkpoint file containing embedded malicious code.
    - If a user is tricked into using this malicious checkpoint file with the project's scripts (e.g., for testing or training), `torch.load` will deserialize the file and execute the attacker's embedded code.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
    - This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, or further propagation of attacks.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not implement any specific mitigations against insecure deserialization during checkpoint loading.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Checkpoint Loading:** Implement a secure mechanism for loading checkpoints. This could involve:
        - Using `torch.load` with `map_location='cpu'` to mitigate GPU-related exploits, although this does not fully prevent insecure deserialization.
        - Manually loading the state dictionary from the checkpoint file after verifying its integrity and authenticity.
        - Exploring alternative serialization methods that are not vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, if feasible within the `pytorch_lightning` framework.
    - **User Warnings:** Display clear warnings to users about the security risks of loading checkpoints from untrusted sources. This should be highlighted in the documentation and potentially during runtime when a checkpoint is loaded.
    - **Checkpoint Integrity Verification:** Provide guidance and tools for users to verify the integrity and authenticity of checkpoint files before loading them. This could involve suggesting the use of cryptographic signatures or checksums for checkpoints.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must download and attempt to use a maliciously crafted checkpoint file provided by an attacker.
    - The victim must execute one of the project's scripts (`test.py`, `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py`, `predict.py`, `benchmark.py`, or `lm_pretrain.py`) that loads the checkpoint file using `pytorch_lightning`'s `load_from_checkpoint` function.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The following files and lines of code are vulnerable because they use `pytorch_lightning`'s `load_from_checkpoint` which relies on `torch.load`:
        - `/code/test.py`: Line 68: `model = Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt).cuda()`
        - `/code/matrix_plugin.py`: Line 120: `test_model = MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt_path, model=matrix).cuda().eval()`
        - `/code/matrix_plugin.py`: Line 248: `test_model = MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt, model=matrix).cuda().eval()`
        - `/code/mtc_model.py`: Line 440: `model = Seq2Seq.load_from_checkpoint(config['ckpt'])`
        - `/code/predict.py`: Line 70: `model = Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt or get_latest_ckpt()).cuda()`
        - `/code/benchmark.py`: Line 62: `model = Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt).cuda().eval()`
        - `/code/generation.py`: Line 32: `class Generation(Seq2Seq, GenerationMixin):` inherits from `Seq2Seq` which can use `load_from_checkpoint`.
        - `/code/lm_pretrain.py`: Implicitly through usage of `Seq2Seq`, although not directly loading in the provided `lm_pretrain.py` script itself, the model definition is vulnerable if checkpoints are loaded elsewhere.
    - `pytorch_lightning`'s `load_from_checkpoint` function, by default, utilizes `torch.load` to load the checkpoint file.
    - `torch.load` deserializes Python objects from the file using `pickle` or `pickle5` modules in more recent versions of PyTorch. These deserialization processes are inherently unsafe when dealing with untrusted data because they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    - When a script calls `load_from_checkpoint` with a path to a malicious checkpoint file, `torch.load` will be invoked, and if the checkpoint is crafted to include malicious serialized objects, code execution will occur during the loading process, before the model is even used.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Checkpoint Creation (`malicious_ckpt_gen.py`):**
        ```python
        import torch
        import subprocess
        import pickle

        class MaliciousCheckpoint:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (subprocess.Popen, (('echo', 'зломано'),)) # Executes 'echo зломано' command

        malicious_ckpt = MaliciousCheckpoint()
        checkpoint_data = {'state_dict': malicious_ckpt, 'hparams': {'model': 'bert-base-cased'}} # Include hparams to mimic real checkpoint
        torch.save(checkpoint_data, 'malicious_checkpoint.ckpt')
        ```
        - Save the above code as `malicious_ckpt_gen.py`.
        - Run `python malicious_ckpt_gen.py` to generate `malicious_checkpoint.ckpt`. This script creates a checkpoint file that, when loaded, will attempt to execute the command `echo зломано`.

    2. **Victim Execution:**
        - Assume the attacker distributes `malicious_checkpoint.ckpt` (e.g., via a compromised website or email).
        - The victim downloads `malicious_checkpoint.ckpt` and places it in the project directory.
        - The victim executes the `test.py` script, pointing it to the malicious checkpoint:
        ```bash
        python test.py --ckpt malicious_checkpoint.ckpt
        ```

    3. **Verification of Code Execution:**
        - After running the `test.py` command with the malicious checkpoint, observe the console output.
        - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the output "зломано" (or equivalent depending on system and command) will be printed to the console, indicating arbitrary code execution.
        - Note: The exact output and success might depend on the environment and permissions. A more robust test might involve a command that creates a file or performs a network request to definitively prove code execution. However, for demonstration purposes, `echo` is sufficient.
