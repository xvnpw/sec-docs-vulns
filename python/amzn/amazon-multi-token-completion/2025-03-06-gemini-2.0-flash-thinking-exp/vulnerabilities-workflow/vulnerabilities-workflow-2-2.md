- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Dataset Loading
- Description:
    1. The application receives a dataset path as input through the command-line arguments `--dataset_path` in `test.py` and `--input_path` in `matrix_plugin.py` and `mtc_model.py`.
    2. This user-provided path is directly passed to the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function to load the dataset.
    3. If an attacker provides a malicious path containing directory traversal sequences like `../../`, the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function will attempt to load the dataset from a location outside the intended directory.
    4. This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files from the system if they can craft a path that leads to sensitive files.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
    - This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or user data.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the user-provided paths without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `--dataset_path` and `--input_path` command-line arguments.
    - Implement checks to ensure that the provided paths are within the expected data directories.
    - Use secure path handling mechanisms to prevent directory traversal, such as resolving paths against a safe base directory and verifying that the resolved path remains within that base directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible.
    - An attacker must be able to execute the training or testing scripts (`test.py`, `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py`) and provide command-line arguments, specifically `--dataset_path` or `--input_path`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `test.py`:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--dataset_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(args.dataset_path)
        ```
        The `dataset_path` argument from the command line is directly used in `datasets.load_from_disk()` without any validation.

    - In `matrix_plugin.py`:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--input_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(args.input_path)
        ```
        The `input_path` argument is directly used in `datasets.load_from_disk()` without validation.

    - In `mtc_model.py`:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument("--input_path", type=str, default=None)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        input_path = args.input_path
        ...
        input_features = datasets.load_from_disk(input_path, fs=fs)
        ```
        Again, `input_path` is used directly in `datasets.load_from_disk()` without validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a dummy dataset using `datasets` library and save it to a directory, e.g., `./dummy_dataset`. This step is to have a valid dataset for the tool to load initially.
    2. Assume there is a sensitive file on the system at `/etc/passwd` (or any other accessible sensitive file for testing purposes).
    3. Run the `test.py` script with a maliciously crafted `--dataset_path` argument to attempt to access the sensitive file. For example: `python test.py --dataset_path '../../../../etc/passwd'`
    4. Observe the application's behavior. If the application attempts to read or process the `/etc/passwd` file (which might result in errors or unexpected output depending on how `datasets.load_from_disk` and subsequent code handle non-dataset files), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
    5. To further validate, try to access a known non-sensitive file outside the intended dataset directory but within accessible paths, e.g., `/tmp/test_file.txt` (create this file beforehand). Run: `python test.py --dataset_path '../../../tmp/test_file.txt'` and check if the application attempts to load this file as a dataset, which would indicate successful path traversal.
