### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal Vulnerability in Dataset Loading
- Description:
    1. The application uses command-line arguments `--dataset_path` in `test.py`, `--input_path` in `matrix_plugin.py`, and `--input_path` in `mtc_model.py` to specify the path to load datasets from disk using the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function.
    2. These paths are taken directly from user input without sufficient validation or sanitization.
    3. An attacker can manipulate these arguments to include path traversal sequences like `../` to escape the intended directory and access files or directories outside of the project's data directory.
    4. For example, by providing `--dataset_path ../../../../../etc/`, the `datasets.load_from_disk()` function in `test.py` will attempt to load a dataset from the `/etc/` directory, potentially exposing sensitive files if they are in a format that `datasets.load_from_disk()` attempts to read.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the Python process has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or data depending on the server setup and file permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the user-provided paths without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement checks to ensure that the provided paths are within the expected data directories and do not contain path traversal sequences.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize user-provided paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences before using them in file system operations. For example, using functions to resolve paths to their canonical form and verifying they are within allowed directories.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the Python scripts (`test.py`, `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py`) and provide command-line arguments. This scenario is likely in research or development environments where users have direct access to run the scripts. In a deployed scenario, if these scripts are exposed through an API or other interface that allows for parameter injection, this vulnerability could be exploited remotely.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/test.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--dataset_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()

        if args.dataset_path is None:
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(f'{HOME_DIR}/MultiTokenCompletionData/input_data_{args.case}')
        else:
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(args.dataset_path) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        - The code uses `argparse` to parse the `--dataset_path` argument.
        - If `--dataset_path` is provided, the `datasets.load_from_disk(args.dataset_path)` function is directly called with the user-supplied path.
        - There is no validation or sanitization of `args.dataset_path` before it's used in `load_from_disk()`.

    - **File: /code/matrix_plugin.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--input_path', type=str)
        args = parser.parse_args()

        if args.force or not os.path.exists(model_path) or not os.path.exists(dataset_path):
            if args.input_path is not None:
                input_path = args.input_path # User controlled input_path
            elif ...
                input_path = ...
            ...
            dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(input_path) # Vulnerable line
        else:
            ...
            seen_dataset = datasets.load_from_disk(dataset_path) # Potentially vulnerable if dataset_path is derived from user input
        ```
        - The code uses `argparse` to parse the `--input_path` argument.
        - If `--input_path` is provided, it's directly assigned to the `input_path` variable.
        - `datasets.load_from_disk(input_path)` is called with this user-controlled `input_path`.
        - Even when `--input_path` is not provided, the `dataset_path` which is used in the `else` block to load dataset might be constructed based on user controlled `model_name` and `dataset_suffix`, which still presents a risk if these are directly derived from user input in other contexts.

    - **File: /code/mtc_model.py**
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument("--input_path", type=str, default=None)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if args.input_path is not None:
            input_path = args.input_path # User controlled input_path
        elif ...
            input_path = ...
        else:
            input_path = ...

        if not os.path.exists(input_path):
            ...
            parse_data(dataset_name, dataset_suffix)

        fs = S3FileSystem() if input_path.startswith('s3://') else None
        input_features = datasets.load_from_disk(input_path, fs=fs) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        - Similar to `matrix_plugin.py`, `mtc_model.py` also uses `argparse` to get `--input_path`.
        - The `input_path` variable, directly derived from user input, is used in `datasets.load_from_disk(input_path, fs=fs)`.
        - The use of `S3FileSystem` (`fs=fs`) only mitigates against path traversal for S3 paths, not for local file paths. If the `input_path` does not start with `s3://`, it will default to local file system access, and the path traversal vulnerability persists.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Assume you have access to the project code and can execute the `test.py` script.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `/code/` directory of the project.
    3. Execute the `test.py` script with a crafted `--dataset_path` argument to attempt path traversal. For example:
        ```bash
        python test.py --dataset_path "../../../../../etc/"
        ```
    4. Observe the output. If the script attempts to read files from the `/etc/` directory, it indicates a path traversal vulnerability. You might see error messages from `datasets.load_from_disk()` if it tries to process files in `/etc/` as a dataset, or if it encounters permissions issues. If successful in reading a recognizable dataset file (unlikely from `/etc/`), the script might proceed further without immediately crashing, still confirming the vulnerability.
    5. To confirm file reading, you can try to target a known file like `/etc/passwd` (if accessible by the user running the script) and check for error messages that suggest the script tried to access or process this file. Note that `datasets.load_from_disk` expects a specific dataset format, so directly reading `/etc/passwd` as a dataset will likely fail, but the attempt to access the path confirms the vulnerability.
    6. To make the test more conclusive without relying on error messages, you could create a dummy dataset in a known location (e.g., `/tmp/test_dataset`) and then use path traversal to access it via a relative path from outside the intended data directory. For example, if your intended data directory is `/code/data`, and you create `/tmp/test_dataset`, you could try running the script with `--dataset_path "../../../tmp/test_dataset"`. If it successfully loads the dummy dataset, it confirms path traversal.
