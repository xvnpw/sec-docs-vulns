## Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Incorrect Import Order Leads to Missing KMS Protection
    - **Description:**
        - A developer intends to use `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` to leverage AWS KMS for JWT cryptographic operations.
        - The developer correctly installs the library using pip.
        - However, in their Python code, the developer **mistakenly imports modules from the `jose` library before importing `jose_aws_kms_extension`**.
        - Due to this incorrect import sequence, the monkey-patching mechanism of `jose_aws_kms_extension`, designed to extend `python-jose` with KMS capabilities, fails to apply correctly.
        - Consequently, when the developer subsequently calls functions like `jose.jwe.encrypt`, `jose.jwe.decrypt`, `jose.jws.sign`, or `jose.jws.verify`, these operations are executed by the **original `python-jose` library**, without the intended AWS KMS protection.
        - If the developer assumes that all cryptographic operations are being handled by AWS KMS due to using this extension, this assumption becomes **invalid**.
        - This discrepancy can lead to sensitive data and cryptographic keys being processed and managed by the standard `python-jose` library instead of AWS KMS, potentially exposing them to security risks if they are not handled with the same level of security as intended with KMS. For example, keys might be stored in memory or logs instead of being securely managed within KMS.
    - **Impact:**
        - **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data intended for encryption using AWS KMS may be encrypted outside of KMS, potentially using less secure methods or keys not managed by KMS, leading to a confidentiality breach.
        - **Data Integrity Compromise:** JWT signatures intended to be generated and verified using KMS-managed keys might be handled using keys outside of KMS, undermining the intended integrity and authenticity assurances.
        - **Key Exposure Risk:** Cryptographic keys intended to be securely managed within AWS KMS might inadvertently be handled by the standard `python-jose` library, increasing the risk of key exposure or mismanagement if developers rely on KMS for key security.
        - **Compliance Violations:** Organizations relying on KMS for compliance (e.g., regulatory requirements for key management) may fail to meet these requirements if KMS is not actually in use due to incorrect import order.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - **Documentation:** The project's README.md file explicitly warns users about the critical import order. It clearly states that `jose_aws_kms_extension` must be imported **before** any `jose` modules to ensure correct monkey-patching and KMS protection.
        - **Usage Examples:** The README.md provides code snippets demonstrating the correct import order, further guiding developers on proper usage.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Runtime Import Order Check:** The library could implement a runtime check to detect if `jose` modules have been imported before `jose_aws_kms_extension`. If this incorrect order is detected, the library could raise an informative exception or warning, immediately alerting the developer to the misconfiguration and preventing potential security flaws.
        - **Automated Security Test:** Adding an automated test case that specifically checks for the scenario where `jose` is imported before `jose_aws_kms_extension` would be beneficial. This test should verify that in such cases, the KMS functionality is indeed bypassed and operations fall back to the original `python-jose` library. This would serve as a regression test to prevent future code changes from inadvertently weakening the monkey-patching mechanism or introducing bypass scenarios.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - The developer must intend to use AWS KMS for cryptographic operations using the `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library.
        - The `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library must be installed in the Python environment.
        - The developer must **incorrectly import modules from the `jose` library (e.g., `from jose import jwe`) before importing `jose_aws_kms_extension` (e.g., `import jose_aws_kms_extension`)** in their Python code.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - The vulnerability stems from the monkey-patching approach used by `jose_aws_kms_extension` to extend `python-jose`. Monkey-patching in Python modifies modules at runtime. However, Python's import mechanism means that modules are loaded only once.

        - **`jose_aws_kms_extension/__init__.py` (Monkey-patching Entry Point):**
            ```python
            from . import constants  # noqa: F401
            from . import jwk  # noqa: F401
            from . import jwe  # noqa: F401
            from . import jwe_tmp  # noqa: F401
            ```
            - This `__init__.py` file is crucial. When `import jose_aws_kms_extension` is executed, these imports within `__init__.py` are processed. These imports, specifically of `jwk.py`, `jwe.py`, `jwe_tmp.py`, and `constants.py`, are where the monkey-patching logic resides. They modify functions and classes within the already loaded `jose` library.

        - **Monkey-patching Modules (`jose_aws_kms_extension/jwk.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/constants.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe_tmp.py`):**
            - These modules contain code that directly modifies functions and attributes of the `jose` library.
            - For example, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwk.py` overrides functions like `jose.jwk.get_key` and `jose.jwk.construct`.
            - `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe.py` overrides `jose.jwe._get_key_wrap_cek`, and `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe_tmp.py` overrides `jose.jwe.encrypt`.
            - `jose_aws_kms_extension/constants.py` overrides `jose.constants.ALGORITHMS` to include KMS-specific algorithms.

        - **Vulnerability Trigger - Incorrect Import Order:**

            ```python
            # Vulnerable Code Snippet
            from jose import jwe # Step 1: Import 'jose.jwe' FIRST
            import jose_aws_kms_extension # Step 2: Import extension AFTER 'jose.jwe'

            # At Step 1:
            # - Python loads the 'jose' package and specifically the 'jose.jwe' module.
            # - The original 'jose.jwe.encrypt', 'jose.jwe.decrypt', etc., functions are loaded into memory.

            # At Step 2:
            # - Python loads 'jose_aws_kms_extension'.
            # - The monkey-patching code in 'jose_aws_kms_extension' attempts to modify 'jose.jwe.encrypt', 'jose.jwe.decrypt', etc.
            # - HOWEVER, because 'jose.jwe' was already loaded in Step 1, the monkey-patching in Step 2 has NO EFFECT on the ALREADY LOADED 'jose.jwe' module.
            # - Any subsequent use of 'jwe.encrypt' will call the ORIGINAL, UNPATCHED function from 'jose', NOT the KMS-extended version.

            plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
            key = 'test-key' # Not a valid KMS key, but irrelevant in vulnerable scenario
            algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
            encryption = 'A128GCM'

            encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key) # Uses original jose.jwe.encrypt
            decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8') # Uses original jose.jwe.decrypt

            print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}") # Operations succeed WITHOUT KMS
            ```

        - **Correct Import Order (Mitigation):**

            ```python
            # Correct Code Snippet - Mitigation
            import jose_aws_kms_extension # Step 1: Import extension FIRST
            from jose import jwe # Step 2: Import 'jose.jwe' AFTER extension

            # At Step 1:
            # - Python loads 'jose_aws_kms_extension'.
            # - Monkey-patching in 'jose_aws_kms_extension' is applied to the 'jose' library in memory.
            # - However, 'jose.jwe' is NOT yet explicitly loaded.

            # At Step 2:
            # - Python loads 'jose.jwe'.
            # - Because 'jose_aws_kms_extension' was already loaded and monkey-patched 'jose', when 'jose.jwe' is loaded NOW, it loads the MONKEY-PATCHED version.
            # - Subsequent use of 'jwe.encrypt' will now call the KMS-extended function.

            plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
            key = '<KMS Key ID or ARN>' # Now a valid KMS key is REQUIRED
            algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
            encryption = 'A128GCM'

            encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key) # Uses KMS-patched jose.jwe.encrypt
            decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8') # Uses KMS-patched jose.jwe.decrypt

            print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}") # Operations succeed WITH KMS (if KMS key and permissions are correct)
            ```
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. **Setup:** Ensure `python-jose` and `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` are installed. No AWS KMS configuration is needed for this test, as we want to demonstrate the *absence* of KMS usage when the import order is incorrect.
        2. **Code:** Create a Python script (e.g., `incorrect_import_test.py`) with the following content:
            ```python
            from jose import jwe  # Incorrect import order: jose first
            import jose_aws_kms_extension

            plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
            key = 'test-key' # Intentionally NOT a KMS key
            algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT' # KMS symmetric encryption algorithm
            encryption = 'A128GCM'

            try:
                encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key)
                decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8')
                print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}")
                assert decrypted_plaintext == plaintext
                print("Vulnerability CONFIRMED: KMS was NOT used. Operations succeeded without KMS setup, indicating fallback to default python-jose behavior due to incorrect import order.")
                exit_code = 0 # Test PASS
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error during JWE operation: {e}")
                print("Vulnerability NOT confirmed: KMS might have been incorrectly used (unexpected).")
                assert False, "JWE operations should succeed WITHOUT KMS setup in case of incorrect import order."
                exit_code = 1 # Test FAIL

            exit(exit_code)
            ```
        3. **Execution:** Run the script from the command line: `python incorrect_import_test.py`
        4. **Expected Result:**
            - The script should execute successfully (exit code 0).
            - The output should include:
                ```
                Decrypted plaintext: Sensitive data
                Vulnerability CONFIRMED: KMS was NOT used. Operations succeeded without KMS setup, indicating fallback to default python-jose behavior due to incorrect import order.
                ```
            - This output confirms that the `jwe.encrypt` and `jwe.decrypt` operations were performed by the original `python-jose` library, not the KMS-extended version, because of the incorrect import order. The operations succeed even without valid KMS credentials or a valid KMS key, demonstrating that KMS was bypassed.
            - If the test fails (exit code 1) or produces different output, it would indicate that the vulnerability is not present (or the test is flawed), which is not expected based on the library's design and monkey-patching mechanism.

- **Vulnerability Name:** AWS KMS Key Policy Misconfiguration leading to Unauthorized Access and Signature Forgery
    - **Description:**
        - The python-jose-aws-kms-extension library extends python-jose to use AWS KMS for cryptographic operations.
        - This library relies on the AWS KMS key policies configured by the user for access control.
        - If the KMS key policy associated with the key used for encryption, decryption, signing, or verification is misconfigured to be overly permissive, it can lead to unauthorized access.
        - For example, if the KMS key policy grants broad `kms:Decrypt` permissions, an attacker with access to these permissions can decrypt data encrypted by the application.
        - Similarly, overly permissive `kms:Sign` permissions would allow an attacker to forge signatures.
        - This vulnerability arises not from a flaw in the library's code, but from insecure KMS key policy configurations in the deployment environment.
    - **Impact:**
        - High
        - Confidentiality breach: An attacker can decrypt sensitive data if the KMS key policy allows unauthorized `kms:Decrypt` actions.
        - Integrity breach: An attacker can forge signatures if the KMS key policy allows unauthorized `kms:Sign` actions, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions within the application.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - None. The library itself does not implement mitigations for KMS key policy misconfigurations.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Documentation:** Explicitly warn users about the security risks associated with overly permissive KMS key policies. Provide guidelines on how to configure KMS key policies securely when using this library. This should include emphasizing the principle of least privilege when granting KMS permissions.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - The application using this library is deployed in an AWS environment.
        - An AWS KMS key is used for cryptographic operations by the application.
        - The KMS key policy associated with this key is misconfigured to be overly permissive, granting excessive permissions (e.g., `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:Sign`) to unintended principals (users, roles, or services).
        - An attacker has obtained AWS credentials that allow them to assume a principal with these excessive KMS permissions. This could be due to various reasons like compromised IAM roles, EC2 instance profiles with overly permissive roles, or cross-account access misconfigurations.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - The library code itself does not contain a direct code-level vulnerability that leads to this issue.
        - The vulnerability is due to the design choice of relying on AWS KMS for key management and cryptographic operations, which inherently depends on the security of the KMS key policies configured outside of the library's scope.
        - The library's classes like `BotoKMSSymmetricEncryptionKey` and `BotoKMSAsymmetricSigningKey` interact directly with the KMS service using boto3. For example, `BotoKMSSymmetricEncryptionKey.generate_data_key` and `BotoKMSAsymmetricSigningKey.sign` methods directly call KMS API operations.
        - If the KMS key used in these operations has a permissive policy, these library functions will successfully execute even when called by an attacker with sufficient AWS permissions, leading to the described vulnerability.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. **Step 1:** Create an AWS KMS key.
        2. **Step 2:** Configure the KMS key policy to be overly permissive. For example, for testing decryption vulnerability, add a statement to the key policy that allows `kms:Decrypt` action from a broad range of AWS accounts or IAM roles that represent the attacker. For signature forgery vulnerability, allow `kms:Sign`.
        3. **Step 3:** Deploy an application that uses the `python-jose-aws-kms-extension` library for encryption/decryption or signing/verification and configure it to use the KMS key created in Step 1. Make the application publicly accessible, or simulate a scenario where an attacker can interact with it.
        4. **Step 4:** As an attacker, obtain AWS credentials that correspond to a principal that is granted the overly permissive permissions in the KMS key policy (from Step 2).
        5. **Step 5a (For Encryption/Decryption Vulnerability):**
            - Use the application to encrypt some data using the KMS key. Obtain the JWE token.
            - Using the attacker's AWS credentials and AWS CLI or SDK, call the KMS `decrypt` operation, providing the encrypted ciphertext from the JWE token and specifying the KMS key ARN.
            - Verify that the KMS `decrypt` operation is successful and the attacker can decrypt the data without authorization from the application level, due to the permissive KMS policy.
        6. **Step 5b (For Signing/Verification Vulnerability):**
            - Using the attacker's AWS credentials and AWS CLI or SDK, call the KMS `sign` operation, providing a message to sign and specifying the KMS key ARN and signing algorithm.
            - Obtain the signature from the KMS `sign` response.
            - Use the application's verification functionality to verify a JWS token constructed with the forged signature (and original message/payload) and the KMS key identifier.
            - Verify that the application incorrectly validates the forged signature as legitimate, due to the attacker's ability to use the KMS key for signing because of the permissive KMS policy.

- **Vulnerability Name:** AWS KMS Key Misconfiguration leading to Unauthorized Cryptographic Operations
    - **Description:**
        1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to an application that uses the `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library. This could be through various means, such as exploiting application vulnerabilities or compromised credentials.
        2. The application is configured to use AWS KMS keys for JWE encryption/decryption and JWS signing/verification.
        3. The AWS KMS key policy associated with the application's KMS keys is overly permissive. For example, it might allow broader IAM roles or principals to perform `kms:Decrypt` or `kms:Sign` actions than necessary for the application's intended functionality.
        4. The attacker leverages the compromised application to initiate JWE decryption or JWS signing operations using the application's KMS keys. The application, using the library, will then make calls to AWS KMS API.
        5. Due to the overly permissive KMS key policy, the KMS API calls initiated by the attacker through the compromised application are authorized by AWS KMS.
        6. The attacker successfully performs unauthorized cryptographic operations (decryption or signing) beyond the application's intended scope, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or forging signatures.
    - **Impact:**
        - High to Critical. Depending on the sensitivity of the data protected by encryption or the criticality of the signing process, the impact could range from high to critical. Unauthorized decryption can lead to data breaches, and unauthorized signing can lead to integrity compromises and trust issues.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High/Critical
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - None. The library itself does not implement any mitigations for KMS key policy misconfigurations. It relies on the user to configure AWS KMS securely.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Documentation and Guidance:** Missing documentation that clearly outlines the security responsibilities of users in configuring KMS key policies. The documentation should emphasize the principle of least privilege when setting up KMS key policies for use with this library. It should include examples of restrictive key policies that limit access to only the necessary IAM roles or principals and actions required by the application.
    - **Preconditions:**
        1. An application using `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` is deployed and accessible to attackers.
        2. The application is configured to use AWS KMS keys for cryptographic operations.
        3. The KMS key policy for the application's KMS keys is misconfigured to be overly permissive, granting excessive permissions (like `kms:Decrypt` or `kms:Sign`) to principals beyond those strictly required by the application.
        4. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - The library utilizes `boto3` to interact with the AWS KMS API.
        - Files like `jose_aws_kms_extension/backends/kms/symmetric/encryption/boto_kms_symmetric_encryption_key.py` and `jose_aws_kms_extension/backends/kms/asymmetric/signing/boto_kms_asymmetric_signing_key.py` contain methods (`generate_data_key`, `decrypt`, `sign`, `verify`) that directly invoke KMS API operations.
        - For example, in `BotoKMSSymmetricEncryptionKey.generate_data_key`, the code directly calls `self._kms_client.generate_data_key` without any policy checks:
          ```python
          data_key_response = self._kms_client.generate_data_key(
              KeyId=self._key,
              KeySpec=key_spec,
              EncryptionContext=self._encryption_context,
              GrantTokens=self._grant_tokens,
          )
          ```
        - Similarly, in `BotoKMSAsymmetricSigningKey.sign`, the code calls `self._kms_client.sign`:
          ```python
          res: SignResponseTypeDef = self._kms_client.sign(
              KeyId=self._key,
              Message=self._hash_provider(msg).digest(),
              MessageType=_MESSAGE_TYPE.DIGEST,
              SigningAlgorithm=self._algorithm,  # type: ignore[arg-type]
              GrantTokens=self._grant_tokens,
          )
          ```
        - The library code does not include any KMS policy validation or enforcement of least privilege. It assumes that the KMS key and its associated policy are properly configured externally.
        - The `README.md` provides usage examples, but it lacks security guidance on KMS key policy configuration.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. **Setup:**
            - Deploy a sample application that uses `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` for JWE encryption and decryption.
            - Configure the application to use a specific AWS KMS key for encryption and decryption operations.
            - **Misconfigure the KMS Key Policy:**  Modify the KMS key policy to be overly permissive. For instance, grant `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:Encrypt` permissions to a wide range of IAM principals or even make it publicly accessible (for testing purposes only and never in a production environment). An example of an overly permissive policy could be granting decrypt permissions to `arn:aws:iam::*:*`.
            - Assume an attacker has gained control or access to the deployed application instance (e.g., through some other vulnerability or insider access).
        2. **Exploit (Unauthorized Decryption):**
            - As an attacker, use the compromised application to attempt to decrypt a JWE token that was originally encrypted using the KMS key.
            - Initiate a decryption request through the application's interface. This action will cause the application to use the `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library to call the KMS `Decrypt` API.
            - Observe if the decryption operation is successful. If the decryption is successful even when, under a least-privilege KMS policy, the attacker (or the assumed compromised application role) should not have `kms:Decrypt` permissions, it indicates a vulnerability due to the overly permissive KMS key policy.
        3. **Expected Result:**
            - With an overly permissive KMS key policy, the attacker will be able to successfully decrypt the JWE token through the compromised application, even if they should not have direct access to decrypt using the KMS key under a correctly configured, least-privilege policy. This demonstrates the vulnerability arising from KMS key misconfiguration.
