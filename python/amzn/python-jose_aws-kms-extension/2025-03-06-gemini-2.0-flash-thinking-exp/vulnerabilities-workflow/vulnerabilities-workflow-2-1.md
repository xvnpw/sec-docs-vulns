- **Vulnerability Name:** Incorrect Import Order Leads to Missing KMS Protection
- **Description:**
    - A developer intends to use `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` to leverage AWS KMS for JWT cryptographic operations.
    - The developer correctly installs the library using pip.
    - However, in their Python code, the developer **mistakenly imports modules from the `jose` library before importing `jose_aws_kms_extension`**.
    - Due to this incorrect import sequence, the monkey-patching mechanism of `jose_aws_kms_extension`, designed to extend `python-jose` with KMS capabilities, fails to apply correctly.
    - Consequently, when the developer subsequently calls functions like `jose.jwe.encrypt`, `jose.jwe.decrypt`, `jose.jws.sign`, or `jose.jws.verify`, these operations are executed by the **original `python-jose` library**, without the intended AWS KMS protection.
    - If the developer assumes that all cryptographic operations are being handled by AWS KMS due to using this extension, this assumption becomes **invalid**.
    - This discrepancy can lead to sensitive data and cryptographic keys being processed and managed by the standard `python-jose` library instead of AWS KMS, potentially exposing them to security risks if they are not handled with the same level of security as intended with KMS. For example, keys might be stored in memory or logs instead of being securely managed within KMS.
- **Impact:**
    - **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data intended for encryption using AWS KMS may be encrypted outside of KMS, potentially using less secure methods or keys not managed by KMS, leading to a confidentiality breach.
    - **Data Integrity Compromise:** JWT signatures intended to be generated and verified using KMS-managed keys might be handled using keys outside of KMS, undermining the intended integrity and authenticity assurances.
    - **Key Exposure Risk:** Cryptographic keys intended to be securely managed within AWS KMS might inadvertently be handled by the standard `python-jose` library, increasing the risk of key exposure or mismanagement if developers rely on KMS for key security.
    - **Compliance Violations:** Organizations relying on KMS for compliance (e.g., regulatory requirements for key management) may fail to meet these requirements if KMS is not actually in use due to incorrect import order.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation:** The project's README.md file explicitly warns users about the critical import order. It clearly states that `jose_aws_kms_extension` must be imported **before** any `jose` modules to ensure correct monkey-patching and KMS protection.
    - **Usage Examples:** The README.md provides code snippets demonstrating the correct import order, further guiding developers on proper usage.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Runtime Import Order Check:** The library could implement a runtime check to detect if `jose` modules have been imported before `jose_aws_kms_extension`. If this incorrect order is detected, the library could raise an informative exception or warning, immediately alerting the developer to the misconfiguration and preventing potential security flaws.
    - **Automated Security Test:** Adding an automated test case that specifically checks for the scenario where `jose` is imported before `jose_aws_kms_extension` would be beneficial. This test should verify that in such cases, the KMS functionality is indeed bypassed and operations fall back to the original `python-jose` library. This would serve as a regression test to prevent future code changes from inadvertently weakening the monkey-patching mechanism or introducing bypass scenarios.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must intend to use AWS KMS for cryptographic operations using the `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library.
    - The `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` library must be installed in the Python environment.
    - The developer must **incorrectly import modules from the `jose` library (e.g., `from jose import jwe`) before importing `jose_aws_kms_extension` (e.g., `import jose_aws_kms_extension`)** in their Python code.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability stems from the monkey-patching approach used by `jose_aws_kms_extension` to extend `python-jose`. Monkey-patching in Python modifies modules at runtime. However, Python's import mechanism means that modules are loaded only once.

    - **`jose_aws_kms_extension/__init__.py` (Monkey-patching Entry Point):**
        ```python
        from . import constants  # noqa: F401
        from . import jwk  # noqa: F401
        from . import jwe  # noqa: F401
        from . import jwe_tmp  # noqa: F401
        ```
        - This `__init__.py` file is crucial. When `import jose_aws_kms_extension` is executed, these imports within `__init__.py` are processed. These imports, specifically of `jwk.py`, `jwe.py`, `jwe_tmp.py`, and `constants.py`, are where the monkey-patching logic resides. They modify functions and classes within the already loaded `jose` library.

    - **Monkey-patching Modules (`jose_aws_kms_extension/jwk.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/constants.py`, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe_tmp.py`):**
        - These modules contain code that directly modifies functions and attributes of the `jose` library.
        - For example, `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwk.py` overrides functions like `jose.jwk.get_key` and `jose.jwk.construct`.
        - `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe.py` overrides `jose.jwe._get_key_wrap_cek`, and `jose_aws_kms_extension/jwe_tmp.py` overrides `jose.jwe.encrypt`.
        - `jose_aws_kms_extension/constants.py` overrides `jose.constants.ALGORITHMS` to include KMS-specific algorithms.

    - **Vulnerability Trigger - Incorrect Import Order:**

        ```python
        # Vulnerable Code Snippet
        from jose import jwe # Step 1: Import 'jose.jwe' FIRST
        import jose_aws_kms_extension # Step 2: Import extension AFTER 'jose.jwe'

        # At Step 1:
        # - Python loads the 'jose' package and specifically the 'jose.jwe' module.
        # - The original 'jose.jwe.encrypt', 'jose.jwe.decrypt', etc., functions are loaded into memory.

        # At Step 2:
        # - Python loads 'jose_aws_kms_extension'.
        # - The monkey-patching code in 'jose_aws_kms_extension' attempts to modify 'jose.jwe.encrypt', 'jose.jwe.decrypt', etc.
        # - HOWEVER, because 'jose.jwe' was already loaded in Step 1, the monkey-patching in Step 2 has NO EFFECT on the ALREADY LOADED 'jose.jwe' module.
        # - Any subsequent use of 'jwe.encrypt' will call the ORIGINAL, UNPATCHED function from 'jose', NOT the KMS-extended version.

        plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
        key = 'test-key' # Not a valid KMS key, but irrelevant in vulnerable scenario
        algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
        encryption = 'A128GCM'

        encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key) # Uses original jose.jwe.encrypt
        decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8') # Uses original jose.jwe.decrypt

        print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}") # Operations succeed WITHOUT KMS
        ```

    - **Correct Import Order (Mitigation):**

        ```python
        # Correct Code Snippet - Mitigation
        import jose_aws_kms_extension # Step 1: Import extension FIRST
        from jose import jwe # Step 2: Import 'jose.jwe' AFTER extension

        # At Step 1:
        # - Python loads 'jose_aws_kms_extension'.
        # - Monkey-patching in 'jose_aws_kms_extension' is applied to the 'jose' library in memory.
        # - However, 'jose.jwe' is NOT yet explicitly loaded.

        # At Step 2:
        # - Python loads 'jose.jwe'.
        # - Because 'jose_aws_kms_extension' was already loaded and monkey-patched 'jose', when 'jose.jwe' is loaded NOW, it loads the MONKEY-PATCHED version.
        # - Subsequent use of 'jwe.encrypt' will now call the KMS-extended function.

        plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
        key = '<KMS Key ID or ARN>' # Now a valid KMS key is REQUIRED
        algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
        encryption = 'A128GCM'

        encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key) # Uses KMS-patched jose.jwe.encrypt
        decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8') # Uses KMS-patched jose.jwe.decrypt

        print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}") # Operations succeed WITH KMS (if KMS key and permissions are correct)
        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Ensure `python-jose` and `python-jose_aws-kms-extension` are installed. No AWS KMS configuration is needed for this test, as we want to demonstrate the *absence* of KMS usage when the import order is incorrect.
    2. **Code:** Create a Python script (e.g., `incorrect_import_test.py`) with the following content:
        ```python
        from jose import jwe  # Incorrect import order: jose first
        import jose_aws_kms_extension

        plaintext = 'Sensitive data'
        key = 'test-key' # Intentionally NOT a KMS key
        algorithm = 'SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT' # KMS symmetric encryption algorithm
        encryption = 'A128GCM'

        try:
            encrypted_token = jwe.encrypt(plaintext=plaintext, key=key, algorithm=algorithm, encryption=encryption, kid=key)
            decrypted_plaintext = jwe.decrypt(jwe_str=encrypted_token, key=key).decode('utf-8')
            print(f"Decrypted plaintext: {decrypted_plaintext}")
            assert decrypted_plaintext == plaintext
            print("Vulnerability CONFIRMED: KMS was NOT used. Operations succeeded without KMS setup, indicating fallback to default python-jose behavior due to incorrect import order.")
            exit_code = 0 # Test PASS
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during JWE operation: {e}")
            print("Vulnerability NOT confirmed: KMS might have been incorrectly used (unexpected).")
            assert False, "JWE operations should succeed WITHOUT KMS setup in case of incorrect import order."
            exit_code = 1 # Test FAIL

        exit(exit_code)
        ```
    3. **Execution:** Run the script from the command line: `python incorrect_import_test.py`
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The script should execute successfully (exit code 0).
        - The output should include:
            ```
            Decrypted plaintext: Sensitive data
            Vulnerability CONFIRMED: KMS was NOT used. Operations succeeded without KMS setup, indicating fallback to default python-jose behavior due to incorrect import order.
            ```
        - This output confirms that the `jwe.encrypt` and `jwe.decrypt` operations were performed by the original `python-jose` library, not the KMS-extended version, because of the incorrect import order. The operations succeed even without valid KMS credentials or a valid KMS key, demonstrating that KMS was bypassed.
        - If the test fails (exit code 1) or produces different output, it would indicate that the vulnerability is not present (or the test is flawed), which is not expected based on the library's design and monkey-patching mechanism.
