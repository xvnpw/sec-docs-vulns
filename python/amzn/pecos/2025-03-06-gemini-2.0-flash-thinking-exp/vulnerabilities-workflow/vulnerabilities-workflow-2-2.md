### 1. Insecure Deserialization in Model Loading

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization in Model Loading
- **Description:**
    1. A malicious actor crafts a specially designed model file. This file leverages Python's pickle or PyTorch's serialization mechanisms to embed malicious code within the serialized model data.
    2. The victim, intending to use the PECOS library, loads this malicious model file using the library's API (e.g., `XLinearModel.load`, `HNSW.load`, `XTransformer.load`).
    3. During the model loading process, the PECOS library deserializes the model file, unknowingly executing the embedded malicious code. This is because `pickle.load` and `torch.load` are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when loading untrusted data.
- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or any other malicious action the attacker desires.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code uses `torch.save` and `torch.load` which are inherently vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement checks to validate the integrity and source of model files before loading. This could include cryptographic signatures or checksums to ensure the model file hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Secure Deserialization:** Migrate away from `pickle` and `torch.load` for model loading. Explore safer serialization formats like JSON or Protobuf, and implement secure deserialization practices. If `torch.load` must be used, ensure it's used with `pickle_module=pickle` and consider using `torch.safeload` (if available and applicable).
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Isolate the model loading process in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of potential code execution.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The victim must download and install the PECOS library.
    2. The victim must attempt to load a malicious model file provided by the attacker, using the PECOS library's model loading API.

        ```python
        @classmethod
        def load(cls, folder, is_predict_only=False, weight_matrix_type="BINARY_SEARCH_CHUNKED"):
            ...
            xlm = cls(HierarchicalMLModel.load(folder, is_predict_only, weight_matrix_type=weight_matrix_type))
            ...

        @classmethod
        def load_mmap(cls, folder):
            ...
            xlm = cls(HierarchicalMLModel.load(folder, is_predict_only=True, lazy_load=True))
            ...

        @classmethod
        def compile_mmap_model(cls, npz_folder, mmap_folder):
            ...
            HierarchicalMLModel.compile_mmap_model(npz_folder, mmap_folder)
            ...
        ```
        The `XLinearModel.load`, `XLinearModel.load_mmap` and `XLinearModel.compile_mmap_model` methods call `HierarchicalMLModel.load` and `HierarchicalMLModel.compile_mmap_model`.
        - **File: /code/pecos/xmc/base.py**
        ```python
        @classmethod
        def load(cls, folder, lazy_load=False):
            ...
            model_ptr = clib.mlmodel_load_mmap(folder, lazy_load=lazy_load)
            return cls(model_ptr=model_ptr, pred_params=pred_params)
            ...

        def save(self, folder):
            ...
            self.fn_dict["save"](self.model_ptr, c_char_p(c_model_dir.encode("utf-8")))
            ...
        ```
        `MLModel.load` calls C++ code `clib.mlmodel_load_mmap` which loads mmap model. `MLModel.save` calls C++ code `self.fn_dict["save"]` to save model.
        - **File: /code/pecos/ann/hnsw/model.py**
        ```python
        @classmethod
        def load(cls, model_folder, lazy_load=False):
            ...
            model_ptr = fn_dict["load"](c_char_p(c_model_dir.encode("utf-8")), c_bool(lazy_load))
            ...

        def save(self, model_folder):
            ...
            self.fn_dict["save"](self.model_ptr, c_char_p(c_model_dir.encode("utf-8")))
            ...
        ```
        `HNSW.load` calls C++ code `fn_dict["load"]` which loads model. `HNSW.save` calls C++ code `fn_dict["save"]` to save model.
        - **File: /code/aws_infra/multinode_batch_cdk/cdk_constructs/dockerfile/Dockerfile**
        ```dockerfile
        RUN cd /pecos-source && make clean && make libpecos
        ```
        Indicates that C++ library `libpecos` is built from source code and used by Python library.
        - **File: /code/setup.py**
        ```python
        ext_module = setuptools.Extension(
            "pecos.core.libpecos_float32",
            sources=["pecos/core/libpecos.cpp"],
            ...
        )
        ```
        Indicates that `pecos.core.libpecos_float32` is a C++ extension module, which implies that model loading and saving in `pecos.core.clib` and `fn_dict["load"]`/`fn_dict["save"]` are likely implemented in C++ and may not directly use Python deserialization. However, the Python API `XLinearModel.load`, `HNSW.load` and `XTransformer.load` are still vulnerable if they indirectly call or integrate with Python deserialization methods at any point in the loading process, or if vulnerabilities exist within the C++ deserialization implementation itself. Deeper C++ code analysis is needed to confirm.

    **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Setup:**
        - Install PECOS library in a virtual environment.
    2. **Craft Malicious Model:**
        - Create a Python script (`malicious_model_generator.py`) to generate a malicious model file. This script will use `pickle` or `torch.save` to serialize a payload that executes arbitrary code when deserialized. For example, the payload could execute `os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')`.
        ```python
        import torch
        import os

        class MaliciousModel:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

        model = MaliciousModel()
        torch.save(model, 'malicious_model.pt')
        ```
    3. **Victim Loads Malicious Model:**
        - Create a Python script (`victim.py`) that uses the PECOS library to load the malicious model file generated in step 2.
        ```python
        from pecos.xmc.xlinear.model import XLinearModel

        try:
            model = XLinearModel.load("./malicious_model.pt")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
        ```
    4. **Execute Test:**
        - Run the malicious model generator script: `python malicious_model_generator.py`
        - Run the victim script: `python victim.py`
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, the vulnerability is confirmed, as this indicates that the malicious code embedded in the model file was executed during the loading process.

This test case attempts to demonstrate arbitrary code execution via insecure deserialization when loading a model file using `XLinearModel.load`. Similar test cases can be created for `HNSW.load` and `XTransformer.load`.

This vulnerability list provides a starting point. Further, deeper code analysis, especially of the C++ codebase, is recommended to fully understand the model loading mechanisms and identify other potential vulnerabilities.
