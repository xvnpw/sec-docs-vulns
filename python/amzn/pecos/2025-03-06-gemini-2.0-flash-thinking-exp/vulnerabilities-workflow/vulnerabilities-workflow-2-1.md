* Vulnerability Name: Deserialization vulnerability in model loading via `numpy.load`

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious NPZ file designed to execute arbitrary code when loaded by `numpy.load`.
    2. The victim, intending to use PECOS library, is tricked into loading this malicious model file, for instance, by using the `XLinearModel.load("./save-models")` function.
    3. The `XLinearModel.load` function, and similar model loading functions in PECOS, internally use `smat_util.load_matrix` to load model parameters from NPZ files.
    4. `smat_util.load_matrix` utilizes `numpy.load` without explicitly disabling the `allow_pickle` option. As a result, `numpy.load` defaults to `allow_pickle=True`, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    5. When the malicious NPZ file is loaded, `numpy.load` deserializes the embedded malicious Python objects, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.

* Impact:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system of a user loading a malicious model.
    - **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
    - **Data Breach:** Sensitive data accessible to the compromised process could be exposed to the attacker.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The codebase uses the vulnerable `numpy.load` function without any input validation or security measures to prevent deserialization attacks.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Disable `allow_pickle` in `numpy.load`:** The most effective mitigation is to explicitly set `allow_pickle=False` whenever `numpy.load` is used to load model files. This prevents the deserialization of Python objects and eliminates the primary attack vector.
    - **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:** Before loading any model file, implement robust checks to validate the file's integrity, origin, and content. This could include:
        - **Cryptographic Signatures:** Verify digital signatures to ensure the model file's authenticity and integrity.
        - **Checksums/Hashes:** Use checksums to detect any unauthorized modifications to the model file.
        - **File Origin Tracking:** Implement mechanisms to track and verify the source of model files to prevent loading from untrusted sources.
    - **Sandboxing or Process Isolation:** Execute the model loading and prediction processes in a restricted or sandboxed environment. This limits the potential damage if a deserialization vulnerability is exploited, preventing full system compromise.
    - **User Warnings and Best Practices Documentation:** Clearly document the security risks associated with loading model files from untrusted sources and advise users to only load models from trusted origins. Provide guidelines on how to verify the integrity of model files.

* Preconditions:
    - **Victim Interaction:** The victim must be tricked into loading a malicious model file. This typically requires social engineering or other methods to convince the user to load a file from an untrusted source.
    - **No Input Validation:** The PECOS library must load the model file without proper validation or security checks, which is the case as identified in the source code analysis.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/pecos/utils/smat_util.py`**
    ```python
    def load_matrix(src, dtype=None):
        ...
        mat = np.load(src)  # Vulnerable function: numpy.load with default allow_pickle=True
        ...
    ```
    The `load_matrix` function, used throughout PECOS for loading matrices from `.npy` and `.npz` files, relies on `numpy.load`. By default, `numpy.load` enables `allow_pickle=True`, which makes it susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities.
    2. **File: `/code/pecos/xmc/xlinear/model.py`**
    ```python
    class XLinearModel(pecos.BaseClass):
        ...
        @classmethod
        def load(cls, folder, is_predict_only=False, **kwargs):
            ...
            W = smat_util.load_matrix("{}/W.npz".format(folder)).tocsc().sorted_indices() # Calls vulnerable load_matrix
            C = smat_util.load_matrix("{}/C.npz".format(folder)).tocsc().sorted_indices() # Calls vulnerable load_matrix
            return cls(W=W, C=C, bias=param["bias"], pred_params=pred_params)
        ...
    ```
    The `XLinearModel.load` method, a key function for model loading in PECOS, directly calls the vulnerable `smat_util.load_matrix` to load model weights and clustering structures. This propagates the deserialization vulnerability to the core model loading mechanism of PECOS. Other model loading functions across the project also use `smat_util.load_matrix`, inheriting this vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Create Malicious Model File:**
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import os

        # Malicious code to be executed
        evil_code = """
        import os
        os.system('touch /tmp/pecos_vulnerable')
        """

        # Create a dictionary containing malicious payload
        malicious_data = {'data': None, 'indices': None, 'indptr': None, 'shape': None, 'evil_code': evil_code}

        # Save malicious data as an NPZ file
        np.savez('malicious_model.npz', **malicious_data, allow_pickle=True)
        print("malicious_model.npz created")
        ```
        This script creates a file named `malicious_model.npz` that includes embedded Python code designed to create a file named `pecos_vulnerable` in the `/tmp/` directory.
    2. **Create Exploit Trigger Script:**
        ```python
        from pecos.xmc.xlinear.model import XLinearModel
        import os

        try:
            model = XLinearModel.load("./malicious_model.npz") # Attempt to load the malicious model
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Loading model failed, but that's expected in this vulnerability test: {e}")

        # Check for exploit success by verifying file creation
        if os.path.exists('/tmp/pecos_vulnerable'):
            print("Vulnerability Exploited: /tmp/pecos_vulnerable created!")
        else:
            print("Vulnerability Likely NOT Exploited.")
        ```
        This script `exploit_test.py` attempts to load the malicious model created in step 1. It then checks for the existence of the `/tmp/pecos_vulnerable` file to confirm if the embedded code was executed.
    3. **Execute Exploit Test:**
        ```bash
        python exploit_test.py
        ```
        Run the `exploit_test.py` script from the command line.
    4. **Verify Exploit Success:**
        After execution, check if the file `/tmp/pecos_vulnerable` has been created:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pecos_vulnerable
        ```
        If the file exists, it confirms that the malicious code embedded in `malicious_model.npz` was successfully executed when the model loading function was called, thus proving the deserialization vulnerability.

This comprehensive vulnerability list pinpoints a critical security flaw in the PECOS project. The identified deserialization vulnerability poses a significant risk, and addressing it by implementing the suggested mitigations is paramount to ensure the project's security.
