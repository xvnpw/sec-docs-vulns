### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** YAML Deserialization leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML configuration file. This file will contain embedded Python code designed for malicious purposes.
    2. The attacker executes the `train.py` script, providing the path to the malicious YAML file using the `-c` command-line argument. For example: `python train.py -c malicious.yaml`.
    3. The `train.py` script, during its initialization, utilizes the `over_write_args_from_file` function to load and parse the provided YAML configuration file (`malicious.yaml`).
    4. The `over_write_args_from_file` function employs the `ruamel.yaml.load` function with `Loader=yaml.Loader` to parse the YAML file. This particular method of YAML loading is known to be unsafe as it can deserialize and execute arbitrary Python code embedded within the YAML file.
    5. Consequently, the malicious Python code embedded in `malicious.yaml` is executed by the `train.py` script during the configuration loading process.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the machine running the `train.py` script.
    - **System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the user running the script, the attacker could potentially gain full control over the system, leading to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.
    - **Data Exfiltration or Modification:** The attacker could use the code execution to steal sensitive data, modify existing data, or disrupt operations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There are no mitigations implemented in the provided project files to prevent YAML deserialization vulnerabilities. The code directly uses the unsafe `ruamel.yaml.load` function.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Use Safe YAML Loading:** Replace `ruamel.yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.Loader)` with `ruamel.yaml.safe_load(file)` in the `over_write_args_from_file` function located in `/code/semilearn/core/utils/misc.py`. `safe_load` only parses standard YAML and prevents the execution of arbitrary code.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation and sanitization of configuration files to ensure they only contain expected keys and values. This would involve defining a schema for the configuration files and validating the input against it before parsing.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the script and the user running it operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to provide a malicious YAML file path to the `train.py` script, which is typically done through the `-c` command-line argument.
    - The `train.py` script must be executed on a system with `ruamel.yaml` library installed and where the script has permissions to perform actions the malicious code intends to execute.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/train.py`**:
        - The `main` function calls `args = get_config()`.
        - `get_config()` function parses command line arguments, including `-c` for configuration file path.
        - `get_config()` then calls `over_write_args_from_file(args, args.c)` to overwrite arguments from the config file.

    2. **File: `/code/semilearn/core/utils/misc.py`**:
        - The function `over_write_args_from_file(args, yml)` is defined.
        - Inside this function, `ruamel.yaml.load(f.read(), Loader=yaml.Loader)` is used to parse the YAML file.

    ```python
    # /code/semilearn/core/utils/misc.py
    import ruamel.yaml as yaml

    def over_write_args_from_file(args, yml):
        """
        overwrite arguments acocrding to config file
        """
        if yml == '':
            return
        with open(yml, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            dic = yaml.load(f.read(), Loader=yaml.Loader) # Vulnerable line
            for k in dic:
                if k not in args.__dict__ or args.__dict__[k] is None:
                    setattr(args, k, dic[k])
    ```

        B --> C[argparse: parse_args()]
        C --> D[train.py: over_write_args_from_file(args, args.c)]
        D --> E[semilearn/core/utils/misc.py: over_write_args_from_file()]
        E --> F[ruamel.yaml: yaml.load(..., Loader=yaml.Loader)]  -- Vulnerable YAML Parsing --> G[Arbitrary Code Execution]
    ```

    - **Explanation:** The code flow starts in `train.py`, where the configuration file path from command-line arguments is passed to `over_write_args_from_file`. This function in `semilearn/core/utils/misc.py` uses the unsafe `yaml.load` with `Loader=yaml.Loader` from `ruamel.yaml`, leading to the YAML Deserialization vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a malicious YAML file named `malicious.yaml` with the following content:**
    ```yaml
    !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
    ```
    This YAML payload will execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned` on a Linux-based system, creating an empty file named `pwned` in the `/tmp/` directory. For Windows, you can use `!!python/object/apply:os.system ["type nul > C:\\TEMP\\pwned"]` (adjust path as needed).
    2. **Run the `train.py` script with the malicious configuration file:**
    ```bash
    python train.py -c malicious.yaml
    ```
    3. **Check for successful exploitation:**
        - **Linux/macOS:** Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created by checking the file system:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
        If the file exists, the vulnerability is successfully exploited.
        - **Windows:** Verify if the file `C:\TEMP\pwned` (or adjusted path) has been created by checking the file system using File Explorer or command prompt:
        ```cmd
        dir C:\TEMP\pwned
        ```
        If the file exists, the vulnerability is successfully exploited.

    **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the command embedded in `malicious.yaml` will be executed, and the file `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\TEMP\pwned` on Windows) will be created, demonstrating arbitrary code execution. If the vulnerability is mitigated, the file will not be created, and the script should ideally either refuse to parse the malicious file or parse it safely without executing code.
