### 1. Vulnerability Name: Numerical Instability in Empirical Measure Kernel Calculation

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious dataset with extreme values in the input features used for `EmpiricalMeasure`.
    2. When the `OrthogonalRBFKernel` with `EmpiricalMeasure` is used with this dataset, the calculation of `var_s` or `cov_X_s` might become numerically unstable due to operations involving very large or very small numbers, potentially leading to `NaN` or `inf` values in kernel matrices.
    3. This numerical instability can cause the Gaussian process model training to fail or produce incorrect results.

- Impact:
    - Model training failure: The training process may crash or produce unusable models due to numerical errors.
    - Incorrect model predictions: If training completes despite numerical issues, the resulting model might make inaccurate predictions, especially on data points similar to the malicious dataset.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not explicitly handle or check for potential numerical instability in `EmpiricalMeasure` kernel calculations.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input data validation: Implement checks to ensure input data for `EmpiricalMeasure` is within a reasonable range to prevent extreme values that could lead to numerical instability.
    - Numerical stability improvements: Investigate and implement numerical stability techniques in the calculation of `var_s` and `cov_X_s` within `OrthogonalRBFKernel` when using `EmpiricalMeasure`, such as using `tf.clip_by_value` or scaling inputs.
    - Error handling: Implement robust error handling to catch numerical exceptions (like `NaN` or `inf`) during kernel calculations and provide informative error messages to the user, preventing unexpected program termination.

- Preconditions:
    - User must choose to use `OrthogonalRBFKernel` with `EmpiricalMeasure`.
    - User must provide a malicious dataset with extreme values in the features used with `EmpiricalMeasure`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/oak/ortho_rbf_kernel.py`
    - Function: `OrthogonalRBFKernel.__init__` and the `EmpiricalMeasure` code block within it.
    - The `var_s` and `cov_X_s` functions for `EmpiricalMeasure` involve matrix multiplications using the base kernel evaluations on the `location` data points which are directly derived from the user's input data.
    - If the `location` data in `EmpiricalMeasure` contains extreme values, and the base kernel (RBF) is evaluated on these extreme locations, it might result in very large or very small kernel values.
    - During the matrix operations in `var_s` (e.g., `tf.matmul(tf.matmul(weights, self.base_kernel(location), transpose_a=True), weights)`) or `cov_X_s` (e.g., `tf.matmul(self.base_kernel(X, location), weights)`), these extreme values can propagate and potentially lead to numerical instability.

    ```python
    if isinstance(self.measure, EmpiricalMeasure):
        def cov_X_s(X): # Potentially numerically unstable if location has extreme values
            location = self.measure.location
            weights = self.measure.weights
            tf.debugging.assert_shapes(
                [(X, ("N", 1)), (location, ("M", 1)), (weights, ("M", 1))]
            )
            return tf.matmul(self.base_kernel(X, location), weights) # Matrix multiplication with kernel evaluations

        def var_s(): # Potentially numerically unstable if location has extreme values
            location = self.measure.location
            weights = self.measure.weights
            tf.debugging.assert_shapes([(location, ("M", 1)), (weights, ("M", 1))])
            return tf.squeeze(
                tf.matmul(
                    tf.matmul(
                        weights, self.base_kernel(location), transpose_a=True # Matrix multiplication with kernel evaluations
                    ),
                    weights,
                )
            )
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious dataset `X_malicious` with a single feature column containing extremely large values (e.g., `[1e10, 2e10, 3e10, 4e10, 5e10]`).
    2. Create a dummy target variable `y` (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
    3. Instantiate `OrthogonalRBFKernel` with `EmpiricalMeasure` using `X_malicious` as the location.
    4. Attempt to train a `GPR` model using `X_malicious` and `y` with the created kernel.
    5. Check if the training process results in numerical errors (e.g., `NaN` loss, errors related to Cholesky decomposition failure due to `NaN` or `inf` in the kernel matrix).
    6. Verify if the trained model produces `NaN` or `inf` predictions when used with similar extreme input values.

    ```python
    import gpflow
    import numpy as np
    from oak.ortho_rbf_kernel import OrthogonalRBFKernel, EmpiricalMeasure
    from gpflow.models import GPR

    # Malicious dataset with extreme values
    X_malicious = np.array([[1e10], [2e10], [3e10], [4e10], [5e10]])
    y = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])

    # Create EmpiricalMeasure with malicious locations
    empirical_measure = EmpiricalMeasure(X_malicious)

    # Create OrthogonalRBFKernel with EmpiricalMeasure
    kernel = OrthogonalRBFKernel(gpflow.kernels.RBF(), empirical_measure)

    try:
        # Attempt to train GPR model
        model = GPR((X_malicious, y), kernel=kernel)
        model.optimize() # This might fail due to numerical instability
        print("Model trained successfully (unexpected)")
        # Test prediction - might produce NaN or inf
        y_pred, _ = model.predict_f(X_malicious)
        print(f"Predictions: {y_pred}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Model training failed as expected due to numerical instability: {e}")
        assert "numerical" in str(e).lower() or "nan" in str(e).lower() or "inf" in str(e).lower()
