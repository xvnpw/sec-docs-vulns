- Vulnerability Name: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Pickle)

- Description:
    1. The project's `identification/test.py` script loads data from pickle files: `train-test-split.pickle` and `embedding.pkl` using Python's `pickle.load()` function.
    2. An attacker could create a malicious pickle file (e.g., `train-test-split.pickle` or `embedding.pkl`) and replace the legitimate file in the dataset.
    3. If a user downloads the dataset and runs the `identification/test.py` script, the script will load the malicious pickle file.
    4. Due to the insecure nature of `pickle.load()`, the malicious pickle file can execute arbitrary Python code when deserialized.
    5. This allows the attacker to gain control of the user's system.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
    - Full compromise of the user's machine if the user runs the vulnerable script.
    - Potential data theft, malware installation, or further malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `pickle.load()` without any security considerations.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Avoid using `pickle` for loading untrusted data**:  The most effective mitigation is to avoid using `pickle` to load data from external sources or user-provided files.
    - **Use safer serialization formats**: Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON, CSV, or Protocol Buffers, which do not inherently allow arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: If pickle is absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization to check the integrity and source of the pickle files. However, this is extremely complex and generally not recommended for mitigating pickle vulnerabilities.
    - **Warning to users**: At a minimum, the documentation should strongly warn users about the security risks of using the provided code with untrusted datasets and pickle files, advising them to only use datasets from trusted sources.

- Preconditions:
    - User must download the project repository and the associated dataset.
    - Attacker must be able to provide a malicious pickle file, for example by tricking the user into downloading a compromised dataset.
    - User must execute the `identification/test.py` script which loads the pickle file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/identification/test.py`
    2. Function: `run_test(args)`
    3. Lines:
       ```python
       testset_path = os.path.join(args.dataset_path, "train-test-split.pickle")
       embedding_location = os.path.join(args.dataset_path, "embedding.pkl")

       with open(testset_path, 'rb') as f:
           train_test_split = pickle.load(f) # Vulnerable line 1
           testcases = train_test_split['testset']
           reference_fnskus = train_test_split['testset-objects']

       feature_embeddings = {}
       if os.path.exists(embedding_location):
           feature_embeddings_file = open(embedding_location, 'rb')
           feature_embeddings_saved = pickle.load(feature_embeddings_file) # Vulnerable line 2
           feature_embeddings = feature_embeddings_saved['feature_embeddings']
           fnsku_map = feature_embeddings_saved['fnsku_map']
           feature_embeddings_file.close()
       ```
    4. Visualization:
       ```
       User (runs identification/test.py) --> Python interpreter --> pickle.load (train-test-split.pickle) --> [Malicious Code Execution if pickle is crafted by attacker]
       User (runs identification/test.py) --> Python interpreter --> pickle.load (embedding.pkl) --> [Malicious Code Execution if pickle is crafted by attacker]
       ```
    5. The `test.py` script in the `identification` directory directly uses `pickle.load` to deserialize data from `train-test-split.pickle` and `embedding.pkl` files. There is no check on the origin or integrity of these files. If a malicious actor replaces these files with crafted pickle files, running `test.py` will lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious pickle file `train-test-split.pickle`**:
        ```python
        import pickle
        import os

        class Exploit:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # Example: create a file /tmp/pwned

        exploit = Exploit()
        pickle_data = pickle.dumps(exploit)

        with open('train-test-split.pickle', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(pickle_data)
        ```
    2. **Replace the original `train-test-split.pickle` with the malicious one**:
        - Assume the user has downloaded the `armbench-object-id-tiny.tar.gz` dataset and extracted it.
        - Navigate to the extracted dataset directory, e.g., `armbench-object-id-tiny/`.
        - Replace the existing `train-test-split.pickle` file with the malicious file created in step 1.
    3. **Run the vulnerable script**:
        - Navigate to the `/code/identification/` directory within the project repository.
        - Execute the test script: `python test.py --dataset_path ../../armbench-object-id-tiny/` (adjust path to dataset as needed).
    4. **Verify exploit**:
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system. If it exists, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was successful due to the pickle vulnerability.
        - Note: The exact location and method of verification might need to be adapted depending on the attacker's payload and the user's system. This test case uses a simple file creation as a proof of concept. A real attacker could execute more harmful commands.
