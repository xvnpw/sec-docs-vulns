### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Image Processing Vulnerability via `torchvision.io.read_image` in Video Defect Detection Dataset Loading

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, or other formats supported by `torchvision.io.read_image`) designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in the `torchvision.io.read_image` function.
    2. The attacker includes this malicious image file within the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset, specifically within a frame folder for a video.
    3. A user downloads and extracts the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
    4. The user executes the provided sample code, such as `train.sh` or `test.sh` in `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/`, which utilizes the `FrameVideoDataset` class defined in `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/src/dataset.py`.
    5. During dataset loading in `FrameVideoDataset.__getitem__`, the code iterates through frame files and uses `torchvision.io.read_image(os.path.join(frame_folder, frame_files[idx]))` to load each frame.
    6. When `torchvision.io.read_image` processes the malicious image file, it triggers a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution) due to the crafted image structure.

- Impact:
    - If exploited successfully, this vulnerability could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in `torchvision.io.read_image`. Potential impacts include:
        - **Code Execution**: The attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, allowing them to gain full control of the system.
        - **Denial of Service**: The image processing vulnerability might cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. (Note: While DoS is generally excluded, a crash indicating a more severe underlying vulnerability is still relevant).
        - **Information Disclosure**: In some scenarios, image processing vulnerabilities can lead to information disclosure, although less likely in this specific context.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any explicit input validation or sanitization for image files loaded using `torchvision.io.read_image`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement checks to validate image file formats and potentially sanitize image data before processing with `torchvision.io.read_image`. However, complete prevention of all image processing vulnerabilities through sanitization is challenging.
    - **Using Secure Image Processing Libraries**: Ensure that `torchvision` and its underlying image processing libraries are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly update dependencies.
    - **Sandboxing or Virtualization**: Running the dataset processing and model training in a sandboxed environment or virtual machine can limit the impact of a successful exploit by containing it within the isolated environment.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must download and use the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
    2. The ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset must contain a maliciously crafted image file.
    3. The user must execute the provided sample code (e.g., `train.sh`, `test.sh`) that loads and processes the dataset using `FrameVideoDataset`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/src/dataset.py`
    - Function: `FrameVideoDataset.__getitem__`
    ```python
    def __getitem__(self, idx) -> Dict:
        # ...
        frame_folder = os.path.join(self.dataset_path, 'cropped_frames', id)
        frame_files = sorted(os.listdir(frame_folder))
        # ...
        frames = []
        for idx in unique_sampled_indices:
            frames.append(read_image(os.path.join(frame_folder, frame_files[idx]))) # Vulnerable line
        frames = torch.stack(frames).float()
        # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the line `frames.append(read_image(os.path.join(frame_folder, frame_files[idx])))`.
    - The `read_image` function from `torchvision.io` is used to load image files from the `frame_folder`.
    - If `frame_files` contains a path to a maliciously crafted image, `read_image` could be exploited when processing it.
    - The code iterates through `frame_files` and directly passes the file path to `read_image` without any validation or sanitization of the file content or format.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a directory structure mimicking the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
        - Within the `cropped_frames` directory, create a subdirectory (e.g., `malicious_video`).
        - Inside `malicious_video`, place a maliciously crafted PNG image file named `0000.png`. You can use publicly available tools or resources to create a malicious PNG that exploits known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, or use a fuzzer to generate potentially problematic images.
        - Create dummy `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the dataset root directory, listing `malicious_video` as a video entry.
        - Set the environment variable `$AB_DD_VIDEOS_DATA` to point to the created dataset directory.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Navigate to the `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/` directory in the project.
        - Run the training script: `./train.sh`.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the execution of the `train.sh` script.
        - Check for crashes, unexpected errors, or unusual behavior during the dataset loading phase, specifically when processing the `malicious_video` entry and loading `0000.png`.
        - A successful exploit might result in a program crash, unexpected output, or, in a more severe scenario, signs of arbitrary code execution.
        - Examine system logs for any error messages related to image processing or crashes originating from `torchvision.io.read_image` or underlying libraries.

- Vulnerability Name: Video Processing Vulnerability via `av.open` and `av.container.InputContainter.decode` in Video Preprocessing Script

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious video file (e.g., MP4, AVI, or other formats supported by `PyAV`) designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in the `av.open` or `av.container.InputContainter.decode` functions of the PyAV library.
    2. The attacker includes this malicious video file within the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset, specifically in the `videos` directory.
    3. A user downloads and extracts the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
    4. The user executes the `preprocess_video.py` script located in `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/scripts/preprocess_video.py` to preprocess the video dataset.
    5. The `preprocess_video.py` script uses `av.open(video_path)` to open each video file and `container.decode(video=0)` to decode video frames.
    6. When `av.open` or `container.decode` processes the malicious video file, it triggers a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution) due to the crafted video structure or metadata.

- Impact:
    - If exploited successfully, this vulnerability could lead to impacts similar to the image processing vulnerability, including:
        - **Code Execution**: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
        - **Denial of Service**: Crash of the preprocessing script.
        - **Information Disclosure**: Potential, but less likely.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `av.open` and `av.container.InputContainter.decode` on video files without any explicit validation or sanitization of the video file content.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement checks to validate video file formats and potentially sanitize video data before processing with PyAV. Similar to image processing, complete prevention is hard.
    - **Using Secure Video Processing Libraries**: Ensure PyAV and its underlying libraries are up-to-date.
    - **Sandboxing or Virtualization**: Running the preprocessing script in a sandboxed environment.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must download and use the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
    2. The ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset must contain a maliciously crafted video file in the `videos` directory.
    3. The user must execute the `preprocess_video.py` script.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/scripts/preprocess_video.py`
    - Function: `processing_single_video`
    ```python
    def processing_single_video(video_name, dataset, delete_video):
        video_path = os.path.join(dataset, 'videos', f"{video_name}.mp4")
        output_folder = os.path.join(dataset, 'cropped_frames', video_name)
        imgs = extract_frames_pyav(video_path, num_samples=None, cut_frames=0) # Vulnerable line
        imgs = crop_frames(imgs, pt1=(100, 80), pt2=(850, 650))
        imgs = resize_frames(imgs, im_w=320, im_h=320)
        save_frames(output_folder, imgs, fmt="jpg")
        if delete_video:
            os.remove(video_path)
    ```
    - File: `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/scripts/preprocess_video.py`
    - Function: `extract_frames_pyav`
    ```python
    def extract_frames_pyav(video_path, num_samples=None, cut_frames=0, max_frames=None):
        container = av.open(video_path) # Vulnerable line
        # ...
        for idx, frame in enumerate(container.decode(video=0)): # Vulnerable line
            # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in `av.open(video_path)` and `container.decode(video=0)` within `extract_frames_pyav` function, which is called by `processing_single_video`.
    - The `av.open` function opens the video file specified by `video_path`, and `container.decode(video=0)` decodes frames from the video.
    - If `video_path` points to a malicious video file, these PyAV functions could be exploited.
    - The script directly processes video files provided in the dataset without validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a directory structure mimicking the ARMBench Defect Detection (videos) dataset.
        - Within the `videos` directory, place a maliciously crafted MP4 video file named `malicious_video.mp4`. You can use publicly available tools or resources to create a malicious MP4 that exploits known vulnerabilities in video processing libraries, or use a fuzzer to generate potentially problematic videos.
        - Create dummy `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the dataset root directory, listing `malicious_video` (without extension) as a video entry.
        - Set the environment variable `$AB_DD_VIDEOS_DATA` to point to the created dataset directory.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Navigate to the `/code/defect_detection/defect_videos/scripts/` directory in the project.
        - Run the preprocessing script: `python preprocess_video.py --dataset_path $AB_DD_VIDEOS_DATA`
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the execution of `preprocess_video.py`.
        - Check for crashes, unexpected errors, or unusual behavior during the video processing phase, specifically when processing `malicious_video.mp4`.
        - A successful exploit might result in a program crash, unexpected output, or, in a more severe scenario, signs of arbitrary code execution.
        - Examine system logs for any error messages related to video processing or crashes originating from PyAV or underlying libraries.
