### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in File Path Arguments

- **Description:**
An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability by manipulating the `--root`, `--save_dir`, or `--embeddings_file` arguments in the `train.py`, `test.py`, `eval.py`, and `preprocessing.py` scripts. By providing crafted paths containing directory traversal sequences like `../`, an attacker could potentially read or write files outside the intended data directories. For example, by setting `--root ../../../`, an attacker could access files in parent directories of the project.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** An attacker could read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other data. In scenarios where the application attempts to write files based on these paths (e.g., `--save_dir`), an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical system files or planting malicious code if write permissions are misconfigured.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code does not implement any explicit sanitization or validation of the input paths provided through command-line arguments.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement input sanitization to validate and sanitize the `--root`, `--save_dir`, and `--embeddings_file` arguments. This should include:
        - Validating that the provided paths are within the expected directory structure.
        - Removing or escaping directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`).
        - Using absolute paths and canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and ensure paths are within allowed boundaries.
    - **Path Validation:** Before using the paths, validate that they exist and are directories (for `--root`, `--save_dir`) or files (for `--embeddings_file`) as expected.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful path traversal attack.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running and accessible to the attacker, either locally or remotely (e.g., via a web interface that executes these scripts based on user input, though this is not evident from the provided files, the vulnerability exists if such interface is added in future).
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the command-line arguments passed to the Python scripts. In a direct execution scenario, this is always the case. In a web application scenario, this would depend on how the application is designed to take user inputs and pass them as arguments.

- **Source Code Analysis:**

    1. **`config.py`:**
        - The `get_args()` function in `config.py` defines the command-line arguments using `argparse`.
        - Arguments like `--save_dir`, `--root`, and `--embeddings_file` are defined as type `str` and are `required=True` or have default values, but there is no input validation or sanitization applied here.

        ```python
        # File: /code/src/config.py
        import argparse

        def get_args():
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Image2Recipe with Transformers and Self Supervised Loss')

            # paths & logging
            parser.add_argument('--save_dir', type=str,
                                required=True,
                                help='Path to store checkpoints.')
            parser.add_argument('--root', type=str,
                                required=True,
                                help='Dataset path.')
            parser.add_argument('--model_name', type=str, default='model',
                                help='Model name (used to store checkpoint files under path save_dir/model_name).')
            # ... other arguments ...

        def get_eval_args():
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument('--embeddings_file', type=str, required=True,
                                help='Full path to embeddings file.')
            # ... other arguments ...
        ```

    2. **`train.py`, `test.py`, `eval.py`, `preprocessing.py`:**
        - These scripts import `get_args()` or `get_eval_args()` from `config.py` to parse command-line arguments.
        - The scripts then directly use the values of `--root`, `--save_dir`, and `--embeddings_file` to construct file paths using `os.path.join` or similar functions without any validation.

        - **`train.py`:**
            ```python
            # File: /code/src/train.py
            import os

            # ...
            def train(args):
                checkpoints_dir = os.path.join(args.save_dir, args.model_name) # Uses --save_dir
                make_dir(checkpoints_dir)
                # ...
                for split in ['train', 'val']:
                    loader, dataset = get_loader(args.root, args.batch_size, args.resize, # Uses --root
                                                 args.imsize,
                                                 augment=True,
                                                 split=split, mode=split,
                                                 text_only_data=False)
                # ...
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                args = get_args()
                train(args)
            ```

        - **`test.py`:**
            ```python
            # File: /code/src/test.py
            import os
            from config import get_args
            # ...
            def test(args):
                checkpoints_dir = os.path.join(args.save_dir, args.model_name) # Uses --save_dir
                # ...
                loader, dataset = get_loader(args.root, args.batch_size, args.resize, # Uses --root
                                             args.imsize,
                                             augment=False,
                                             split=args.eval_split, mode='test',
                                             drop_last=False)
                # ...
                file_to_save = os.path.join(checkpoints_dir, # Uses --save_dir
                                            'feats_' + args.eval_split+'.pkl')
                # ...
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                args = get_args()
                test(args)
            ```

        - **`eval.py`:**
            ```python
            # File: /code/src/eval.py
            import pickle
            from config import get_eval_args
            # ...
            def eval(args):
                # Load embeddings
                with open(args.embeddings_file, 'rb') as f: # Uses --embeddings_file
                    # ...
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                args = get_eval_args()
                eval(args)

            import os

            def run(root, min_freq=10, force=False): # root is from --root argument
                folder_name = 'traindata'
                save_dir = os.path.join(root, folder_name) # Uses --root
                make_dir(save_dir)
                # ...
                for layer_name in layers_to_load:
                    layer_file = os.path.join(root, layer_name+ '.json') # Uses --root
                    # ...
                create_vocab = not os.path.exists('../data/vocab.pkl') or force # Hardcoded path outside --root, but still relevant in context of path handling
                if create_vocab:
                    # ...
                    if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(save_dir, 'counter.pkl')) or force: # Uses --root indirectly via save_dir
                        # ...
                    else:
                        counter = pickle.load(open(os.path.join(save_dir, 'counter.pkl'), 'rb')) # Uses --root indirectly via save_dir
                        # ...

                    pickle.dump(counter, open(os.path.join(save_dir, 'counter.pkl'), 'wb')) # Uses --root indirectly via save_dir

                if create_vocab:
                    # ...
                    pickle.dump(vocab, open(os.path.join('../data', 'vocab.pkl'), 'wb')) # Hardcoded path outside --root, but still relevant in context of path handling

                for key, data in datasets.items():
                    pickle.dump(data, open(os.path.join(save_dir, key+'.pkl'), 'wb')) # Uses --root indirectly via save_dir
                    # ...
                for key, data in datasets_noimages.items():
                    pickle.dump(data, open(os.path.join(save_dir, key+'_noimages.pkl'), 'wb')) # Uses --root indirectly via save_dir

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                args = get_preprocessing_args()
                run(args.root, args.min_freq, args.force) # args.root is from --root argument
        ```

    3. **Vulnerability Point:** The scripts directly use the command-line arguments to construct file paths without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate these arguments to access files outside the intended directories.

- **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Access to a system where the code is deployed or runnable.
        - Ability to execute the `test.py` script and provide command-line arguments.

    2. **Steps to reproduce:**
        - Navigate to the `/code/src` directory.
        - Execute the `test.py` script with a malicious `--root` argument designed to traverse directories and access a sensitive file outside the intended dataset directory. For example, assuming there is a sensitive file at `/etc/passwd` on the system (for Linux-like systems), you could try to access it by setting `--root` to traverse up to the root directory and then access `/etc/passwd`. Since the script is trying to load dataset files within the root directory, this might cause errors during dataset loading, but we can verify if the path traversal is possible by observing the script's behavior or modifying it to print the constructed paths.

        ```bash
        cd /code/src
        python test.py --root "../../../../" --save_dir ./output_test --model_name test_model --eval_split test
        ```

    3. **Expected result:**
        - By manipulating the `--root`, `--save_dir`, or `--embeddings_file` arguments, the script will attempt to access files at locations outside the intended project directory, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability. Error messages related to file not found in unexpected directories or successful (though likely erroneous due to data mismatch) execution using traversed paths would indicate the vulnerability.

    4. **Remediation:**
        - Implement input sanitization and path validation as described in the "Missing Mitigations" section to prevent path traversal attacks.

#### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization in Model Checkpoint Loading

- **Description:** The application loads model checkpoints and training arguments from disk using `torch.load` and `pickle.load` in the `load_checkpoint` function within `/code/src/utils/utils.py`. These functions are vulnerable to insecure deserialization. A malicious actor could craft a malicious checkpoint file (`model-best.ckpt`, `model-curr.ckpt`) or arguments file (`args.pkl`) and replace the legitimate files in the checkpoint directory. When a user downloads and uses this malicious checkpoint (either pretrained or to resume training), arbitrary code embedded within the checkpoint file will be executed on their machine during the model loading process. The vulnerability can be triggered when `train.py` or `test.py` scripts are executed, as they both utilize the `load_checkpoint` function to load model states and configurations.

- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain full control over the user's system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or further unauthorized activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project does not implement any specific measures to prevent insecure deserialization when loading model checkpoints.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement integrity checks to verify the authenticity and integrity of checkpoint files before loading. This could include cryptographic signatures to ensure that the files originate from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with. However, this is complex to implement properly and doesn't fundamentally solve the deserialization issue.
    - **Secure Deserialization:** Migrate away from `pickle` for loading arguments and, if possible, for model states. For `torch.load`, consider using `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)` when loading model weights if applicable and if the PyTorch version is >= 1.12.0. For general data serialization, explore safer alternatives to `pickle` such as `safetensors` or JSON for configurations, ensuring that data is treated as data and not executable code during loading.
    - **User Warnings:** Provide prominent warnings in the documentation (e.g., README, usage instructions) about the security risks associated with downloading and using pre-trained models from untrusted sources. Advise users to only utilize checkpoints from verified and reputable sources.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must download and attempt to use a maliciously crafted model checkpoint file (`model-best.ckpt`, `model-curr.ckpt`) or arguments file (`args.pkl`).
    - The malicious file must be placed in the directory where the application expects to find checkpoints, typically within the path specified by `--save_dir` and `--model_name` arguments, potentially overwriting or replacing legitimate checkpoint files.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability exists in the `/code/src/utils/utils.py` file within the `load_checkpoint` function.
    - Step-by-step code analysis:
        1. The `load_checkpoint` function is called in `train.py` and `test.py` to load model checkpoints.
        2. Inside `load_checkpoint`, `torch.load` is used to load `model_state_dict` from `model-*.ckpt` files:
        ```python
        model_state_dict = torch.load(os.path.join(checkpoints_dir, 'model-'+suff+'.ckpt'), map_location=map_loc)
        ```
        `torch.load` with default settings (using `pickle` module) is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. If a malicious `model-*.ckpt` file is provided, it can execute arbitrary code during loading.
        3. Similarly, `torch.load` is used to load optimizer state from `optim-*.ckpt` files:
        ```python
        opt_state_dict = torch.load(os.path.join(checkpoints_dir, 'optim-'+suff+'.ckpt'), map_location=map_loc)
        ```
        This is also vulnerable to insecure deserialization if a malicious `optim-*.ckpt` file is provided.
        4. `pickle.load` is used to load training arguments from `args.pkl` file:
        ```python
        args = pickle.load(open(os.path.join(checkpoints_dir, 'args.pkl'), 'rb'))
        ```
        `pickle.load` is inherently insecure and can execute arbitrary code if a malicious `args.pkl` file is loaded.
    - Visualization: The attack flow is as follows:
        ```
        Attacker crafts malicious checkpoint files (model-*.ckpt, optim-*.ckpt, args.pkl)
        -> Attacker replaces legitimate checkpoint files in the repository or distribution
        -> User downloads the project and potentially the malicious checkpoints (e.g., via `git lfs pull` for pretrained models) or uses a project that was already compromised.
        -> User runs train.py or test.py, which calls load_checkpoint
        -> load_checkpoint uses torch.load and pickle.load to load the malicious files
        -> Insecure deserialization in torch.load and pickle.load triggers arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the project environment set up as described in the README.md.
    2. **Malicious Payload Creation:** Create a malicious `args.pkl` file. You can use the following Python code to generate a malicious `args.pkl` file that executes `touch /tmp/pwned` when loaded:
        ```python
        import pickle
        import argparse
        import os

        class MaliciousArgs:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

        # Create dummy args object to mimic the structure of original args.pkl
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--dummy_arg', type=str, default='dummy_value')
        args = parser.parse_args([])
        args.__dict__.update({'dummy_arg': 'dummy_value', 'malicious_payload': MaliciousArgs()})

        with open('args.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(args, f)
        ```
    3. **Replace `args.pkl`:** Navigate to the checkpoints directory of a model (e.g., if you are using the pretrained models, it would be `checkpoints/MODEL_NAME`). Replace the existing `args.pkl` file with the malicious `args.pkl` file created in the previous step.
    4. **Execute `test.py`:** Run the `test.py` script using a pretrained model name. For example:
        ```bash
        python src/test.py --model_name MODEL_NAME --eval_split test --root DATASET_PATH --save_dir ../checkpoints
        ```
        Replace `MODEL_NAME` with the name of the pretrained model you are testing and `DATASET_PATH` with the path to your Recipe1M dataset.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created. If the file exists, it indicates that the malicious payload in `args.pkl` was executed during the model loading process, confirming the insecure deserialization vulnerability.
    6. **Cleanup:** Remove the `/tmp/pwned` file after testing.

#### Vulnerability Name: Image Processing Vulnerability via PIL Library

- **Description:**
    The project utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to load and process images within the `Recipe1M` dataset class in `src/dataset.py`. If an application were to use this code to process user-uploaded images, a maliciously crafted image could exploit potential vulnerabilities within the PIL library during the image loading process using `Image.open()`. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, or other formats supported by PIL) specifically designed to exploit a known vulnerability in the PIL library.
    2. An application using this project's code is set up to allow users to upload images for recipe retrieval or feature extraction.
    3. The attacker uploads the malicious image through the application's upload functionality.
    4. The application uses the `Recipe1M` dataset class or similar image loading mechanism from the project to process the uploaded image using `Image.open()`.
    5. If the uploaded image successfully exploits a vulnerability in PIL, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to:
    - Data breach and exfiltration of sensitive information, including model weights, dataset, and potentially user data if the application handles user data.
    - Installation of malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the server.
    - Denial of service by crashing the application or the server.
    - Further lateral movement within the network if the server is part of a larger infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project code directly uses PIL's `Image.open()` to load images without any input validation or sanitization. The security relies entirely on the underlying PIL library and the operating system's image handling capabilities.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation to check the file type and format of uploaded images before processing them with PIL. This could include using file signature verification to ensure the file type matches the expected image format and potentially using dedicated image validation libraries to detect and reject potentially malicious images.
    - **Update and Harden PIL Library:** Ensure that the PIL library (and its dependencies like Pillow) is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Regularly check for security advisories and update the library as needed.
    - **Sandboxing or Containerization:** Run the image processing components of the application in a sandboxed environment or within containers with restricted permissions. This limits the potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited, as the attacker's code execution would be confined to the sandbox or container environment.
    - **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Conduct regular security audits of all project dependencies, including PIL, torchvision, timm, and other libraries, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application built using this project's code must process user-uploaded images.
    - A known vulnerability must exist in the version of the PIL library being used by the application that can be triggered by a crafted image.
    - The attacker must be able to upload a malicious image to the application.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/dataset.py`
    - Class: `Recipe1M`
    - Method: `__getitem__(self, idx)`
    ```python
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        entry = self.data[self.ids[idx]]
        if not self.text_only_data:
            # loading images
            if self.split == 'train':
                # if training, pick an image randomly
                img_name = choice(entry['images'])
            else:
                # if test or val we pick the first image
                img_name = entry['images'][0]

            img_name = '/'.join(img_name[:4])+'/'+img_name
            img = Image.open(os.path.join(self.root, self.split, img_name)) # Vulnerable line
            if self.transform is not None:
                img = self.transform(img)
        else:
            img = None
        ...
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The line `img = Image.open(os.path.join(self.root, self.split, img_name))` directly uses `PIL.Image.open()` to load an image from a file path. If `img_name` originates from user input or is influenced by an attacker and points to a maliciously crafted image, and if PIL has a vulnerability in its image decoding process, this line becomes the point of exploitation.
    - **Data Flow:** The `img_name` is derived from the dataset (`entry['images']`). In a real-world application, if the image path or the image itself is sourced from user uploads, an attacker could potentially inject a malicious image path or upload a malicious image file. When `Image.open()` processes this attacker-controlled image, it could trigger a vulnerability in PIL.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the project environment as described in the `README.md`, including installing dependencies and preparing the dataset.
    2. **Identify PIL Vulnerability:** Research and identify a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability in the PIL library (or Pillow, a common fork of PIL) that can be triggered by a crafted image file (e.g., a specific type of PNG or JPEG vulnerability). Obtain or create a proof-of-concept malicious image that exploits this vulnerability.
    3. **Modify `test.py` for Malicious Image Loading:**
        - Modify the `test.py` script to bypass the dataset loading and directly load the malicious image.
        - Add code to `test.py` to directly load the malicious image using `PIL.Image.open()`. For example, you could replace the dataloader part with code that directly opens the malicious image file.
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        import os

        # Path to the malicious image file
        malicious_image_path = 'path/to/malicious.png' # Replace with actual path

        try:
            img = Image.open(malicious_image_path) # Load malicious image directly
            # ... rest of the test.py code to process the image with the model ...
            print("Image loaded successfully (potentially vulnerable).") # Indicate image loading
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading image: {e}") # Error if loading fails (not necessarily vulnerability)
            exit()

        # ... rest of test.py to process the image if loaded ...
        ```
    4. **Run `test.py`:** Execute the modified `test.py` script.
    5. **Observe for Exploitation:** Monitor the execution of `test.py` for signs of successful vulnerability exploitation. This could manifest as:
        - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the vulnerability leads to code execution, you might be able to observe unexpected system behavior, such as creation of files, network connections initiated from the process, or crashes followed by execution of attacker-controlled code. You can attempt to execute a simple command like creating a file in a temporary directory to confirm code execution.
        - **Crash or Unexpected Termination:** The application might crash or terminate unexpectedly if the malicious image triggers a memory corruption or similar vulnerability in PIL.
        - **No Immediate Effect (Blind Vulnerability):** Some vulnerabilities might not have immediate visible effects but could still be exploited for information disclosure or later stages of an attack. In such cases, further analysis and more sophisticated testing techniques might be needed.
    6. **Expected Result (Vulnerability Confirmation):** If the malicious image successfully exploits the PIL vulnerability, you should observe behavior indicative of code execution or a crash, confirming the presence of the image processing vulnerability. If the application crashes or allows for code execution upon processing the crafted image, the vulnerability is validated.
