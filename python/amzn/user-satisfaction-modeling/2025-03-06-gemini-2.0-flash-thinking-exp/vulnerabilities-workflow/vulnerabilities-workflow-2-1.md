### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via Unsafe Deserialization in Data Loading

- Description:
    1. The `load_data` function in `/code/src/utils.py` uses `eval()` to parse user input text from dataset files.
    2. Specifically, the line `input_text = eval(items[0])` in `utils.py` directly executes Python code embedded within the dataset files.
    3. A malicious actor could craft a dataset file (e.g., `train_sgd.txt`, `valid_sgd.txt`, `test_sgd.txt`) where the first field of a line contains malicious Python code instead of dialogue text.
    4. When the `load_data` function processes this crafted dataset, `eval()` will execute the malicious code, leading to code injection.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful code injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or machine running the training or evaluation scripts. This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data, including training data, model parameters, or server credentials.
        - System compromise: Gaining full control over the server, installing backdoors, or performing further attacks.
        - Data manipulation: Altering training data or model parameters to degrade model performance or introduce biases.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses `eval()` without any sanitization or validation of the input data.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Replace `eval()` with safe parsing methods**: Use `json.loads()` or `ast.literal_eval()` for parsing data, depending on the expected format. If the data is plain text, directly read the text without using `eval()`. In this case, the data is dialogue turns, which should be parsed as strings, not evaluated as code.
    - **Input validation**: Implement checks to ensure that the input data conforms to the expected format and does not contain unexpected or malicious content. This could involve regular expressions or custom parsing logic.
    - **Dataset integrity checks**: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of the dataset files to prevent tampering by malicious actors. This could involve checksums or digital signatures.

- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to modify the dataset files used by the application. For example, if the application downloads datasets from a public repository, an attacker could submit a pull request with a malicious dataset. Or, if the application uses a local dataset, an attacker could gain access to the file system to modify the dataset files.
    2. The training or evaluation script (`train.sh`, `test.sh`) must be executed using the modified dataset.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/utils.py`
    - Function: `load_data(args, tokenizer)`
    - Vulnerable code block:
    ```python
    with open(os.path.join(dirname, f'{set_name}_{args.data}.txt'), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile:
        for line in infile:
            items = line.strip('\n').split('\t')
            input_text = eval(items[0]) # Vulnerable line: uses eval() to process input
            act_seq = eval(items[1])
            sat = int(items[2])
            # ... rest of the code
    ```
    - **Step-by-step analysis:**
        1. The `load_data` function opens and reads dataset files (e.g., `train_sgd.txt`).
        2. For each line in the dataset file, it splits the line by tabs (`\t`) into `items`.
        3. `eval(items[0])` is called on the first item of each line, which is supposed to be the input text (dialogue turns).
        4. If the content of `items[0]` is maliciously crafted to contain Python code, `eval()` will execute this code.
        5. This allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the Python script.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious dataset file:** Create a file named `test_sgd.txt` (or whichever dataset is used by default or in the test script). Replace the content of this file with the following malicious data, ensuring it's placed in the correct dataset directory (`../dataset/sgd/`):
    ```text
    ['__import__("os").system("touch /tmp/pwned")']	['act_1', 'act_2']	1
    ['Hello']	['act_3']	2
    ```
    This malicious input uses `__import__("os").system("touch /tmp/pwned")` which, when evaluated by `eval()`, will execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system, creating an empty file named `pwned` in the `/tmp/` directory.
    2. **Run the test script:** Execute the `test.sh` script provided in the project. This script by default uses the `sgd` dataset and runs evaluation.
    ```sh
    ./test.sh
    ```
    3. **Check for successful code injection:** After running the `test.sh` script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system.
    ```sh
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```
    If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the malicious code within the crafted dataset was successfully executed via `eval()`, demonstrating the code injection vulnerability.

This test case proves that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious content in the dataset files due to the use of the unsafe `eval()` function in the data loading process.
