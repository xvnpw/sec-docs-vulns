### Vulnerabilities Found

The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the RheocerOS project. These vulnerabilities are considered high or critical severity and pose a significant security risk if exploited.

#### 1. Code Injection in BatchCompute scala_script and Python code

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor can inject arbitrary code into the `scala_script` parameter or inline Python code within a `BatchCompute` definition in a RheocerOS application. This injection point is accessible when defining `compute_targets` in the `create_data` API.
    2. When the RheocerOS application is activated and a workflow containing this `BatchCompute` node is executed, the injected code is passed to the AWS Glue or Lambda environment for execution, depending on the `BatchCompute` configuration and chosen language.
    3. The injected code is then executed with the privileges of the IAM role assumed by the RheocerOS application in the user's AWS account. This allows the attacker to perform actions within the AWS environment with the application's permissions.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Successful code injection allows for arbitrary code execution within the AWS environment managed by RheocerOS. This can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration or modification in S3 or other AWS services accessible by the IAM role.
        - Unauthorized access to and control over AWS resources.
        - Denial of Service by consuming resources or disrupting services (although DoS vulnerabilities are excluded, this can be a side-effect).
        - Lateral movement to other systems within the AWS environment if the IAM role has sufficient permissions.
        - Compromise of the integrity of AI/ML workflows by manipulating data or logic.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly takes the `scala_script` string and inline Python code and executes them in the Glue/Lambda environment without any sanitization or validation. Examples in documentation and README reinforce this direct usage.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `scala_script` and inline Python code parameters within `BatchCompute` definitions to prevent injection of malicious code. Consider using a secure code editor or a limited DSL (Domain Specific Language) for scripting if full script execution is not necessary.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the IAM role assumed by RheocerOS applications has the minimum necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting overly permissive roles like `AdministratorAccess`.
    - **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify and eliminate potential injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Explore sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of potentially malicious code executed within `BatchCompute` nodes.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (If Applicable):**  If the compute targets can be structured using parameterized queries or prepared statements, this approach should be considered to further reduce injection risks.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the RheocerOS application code, specifically the `scala_script` or inline Python code blocks in `BatchCompute` definitions. This could happen if:
        - The attacker has compromised the development environment where the RheocerOS application code is written.
        - The attacker is an authorized user who is intentionally injecting malicious code.
        - The application code is dynamically generated based on external input without proper sanitization (less likely in this framework based on current files, but a potential future risk if the framework evolves).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/api/api_ext.py`**
    2. **Class: `BatchCompute`**
    3. **Method: `__init__`**
    4. The `BatchCompute` class in `/code/api_ext.py` takes `scala_script` and inline Python code as parameters:
    ```python
    class BatchCompute(InternalDataNode.BatchComputeDescriptor):
        def __init__(
            self,
            scala_script: str = None, # <-- Injection point (Scala)
            python_script: str = None, # <-- Injection point (Python)
            lang: Lang = Lang.PYTHON,
            abi: ABI = ABI.GLUE_EMBEDDED,
            external_library_paths: Sequence[str] = None,
            extra_permissions: List[Permission] = None,
            retry_count: int = 0,
            **kwargs,
        ) -> None:
    ```
    5. The `scala_script` and `python_script` parameters are directly passed to the `BatchCompute` object without any validation or sanitization.
    6. **File: `/code/README.md`** and **`/code/doc/user_guide/USER_GUIDE.md`**
    7. The `README.md` and user guide show examples of using `scala_script` and inline Python code in `BatchCompute` definitions:
    ```python
    BatchCompute(
        scala_script("""
            pdex
                .filter(...)
                .select(...)
                .distinct()
                """
            ),
        lang=Lang.SCALA,
        ...
    )
    ```
    and similar examples with inline Python code, reinforcing their intended use and highlighting them as prime targets for injection.
    8. **Conclusion:** The code analysis confirms that both the `scala_script` and `python_script` parameters in `BatchCompute` are direct injection points. The framework code does not include any input validation or sanitization for these parameters. The examples in documentation actively encourage direct use of user-provided strings.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:**
        - Access to a RheocerOS project code base.
        - An AWS account with permissions to deploy and run RheocerOS applications.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection (Scala Script):**
        - Modify an existing RheocerOS application code or create a new one.
        - In a `BatchCompute` definition (using `lang=Lang.SCALA`), replace the existing `scala_script` with malicious code. For example, to exfiltrate environment variables to an attacker-controlled S3 bucket (as shown in the original vulnerability description).
    3. **Vulnerability Injection (Python Script):**
        - Similarly, for `BatchCompute` definitions using `lang=Lang.PYTHON` and inline `python_script`, inject malicious Python code. For example, to list files in the `/tmp/` directory:
        ```python
        BatchCompute(
            python_script("""
                import os
                os.system('ls -al /tmp/')
                """),
            lang=Lang.PYTHON,
            ...
        )
        ```
    4. **Application Activation and Execution:**
        - Activate the modified RheocerOS application.
        - Trigger the workflow containing the `BatchCompute` node with the malicious script.
    5. **Verification:**
        - **For Scala Script:** Check the attacker-controlled S3 bucket (if used in the injected code) or examine the CloudWatch logs for the Glue job execution. The output of the injected Scala code, including the attempt to exfiltrate credentials, should be visible in the logs.
        - **For Python Script:** Examine the CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function or Glue job execution (depending on ABI). The output of the injected Python code, such as the directory listing, should be present in the logs.

#### 2. Overly Permissive IAM Role Creation during Application Setup

- **Description:**
  - Step 1: A user with overly broad permissions (e.g., Administrator) initiates the setup of a RheocerOS application using `AWSApplication` class.
  - Step 2: During the application initialization, RheocerOS framework automatically creates an IAM Dev Role (`<app_name>-<aws_region>-IntelliFlowDevRole`) if it doesn't already exist.
  - Step 3: If the bootstrapping entity (user credentials used to initialize `AWSApplication`) has excessive permissions, RheocerOS might create the Dev Role with overly permissive policies, potentially inheriting or mirroring the excessive permissions of the bootstrapper.
  - Step 4: An attacker, who could be an authorized user with access to the RheocerOS application or an external attacker exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain limited access, could then manipulate user-defined workflows or framework logic to assume this overly permissive Dev Role.
  - Step 5: By assuming the Dev Role, the attacker gains elevated privileges within the AWS account, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources, data exfiltration, or further privilege escalation.

- **Impact:**
  - **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to full control of the AWS account where RheocerOS application is deployed if the Dev Role inherits Administrator level permissions. An attacker could gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete resources, and pivot to other AWS services within the account.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None in the provided code snippets and documentation. The documentation only mentions the *minimum* permissions required for the bootstrapper entity to create the Dev Role, but it doesn't enforce least privilege role creation or warn against overly permissive bootstrapping entities.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Least Privilege IAM Role Creation:** RheocerOS should implement a mechanism to create IAM Dev Roles with only the necessary permissions required for the application to function correctly. This mechanism should avoid inheriting excessive permissions from the bootstrapping entity. This could involve defining a strict, minimal policy template for Dev Roles.
  - **Bootstrapper Permission Validation:** During application setup, RheocerOS should validate the permissions of the bootstrapping entity and warn the user if excessive permissions are detected. It should guide users towards using a bootstrapping entity with least privilege.
  - **Documentation and Guidance:** Enhance documentation to explicitly warn users about the security risks of overly permissive bootstrapping entities and provide best practices for IAM role management during RheocerOS application setup. Provide example least privilege policies for the bootstrapper role.

- **Preconditions:**
  - An AWS account with RheocerOS deployed.
  - A bootstrapping entity (AWS user or role) with overly permissive IAM policies (e.g., AdministratorAccess) used to initialize the RheocerOS application.
  - An attacker with ability to manipulate RheocerOS workflows or framework logic to assume the Dev Role or who compromises a user who can assume the role.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - File: `/code/README.md`
    - The `README.md` mentions: "AWS Entity represented by the credentials should have the rights to: create/delete/modify the prospective dev-role of the application which is to be created ... Or do anything / admin :)"
    - This highlights that RheocerOS's design relies on the bootstrapper entity having permissions to create/modify IAM roles, and if the bootstrapper has "admin" rights, the created Dev Role might inherit those excessive permissions or be created with similar broad permissions.
  - File: `/code/src/intelliflow/api_ext.py`
    - The `AWSApplication` class constructor in `api_ext.py` handles credential initialization. It allows for "default credentials (admin)", "dev role credentials", and "admin access pair".
    - The comment `#  - can create/delete roles (dev role of this app) that would have this app-name and IntelliFlow in it #  - can get/assume its dev-role (won't help if this is the first run)` indicates that the framework creates and assumes the dev-role, and the bootstrapper needs permissions to manage this role.
    - The code does not seem to have explicit checks or enforcement of least privilege during IAM role creation.
  - File: `/code/test/intelliflow/core/application/batch/test_aws_application_batch_job.py`
    - This test file includes the function `create_compute_env_resources` which uses `IF_DEV_ROLE_NAME_FORMAT` to define the IAM Dev Role name and `create_job_flow_instance_profile` to create the instance profile associated with the IAM role.
    - This confirms that RheocerOS code programmatically creates IAM roles during application setup.
    - The code doesn't show any logic to restrict permissions of the created IAM role, suggesting it might inherit permissions from the bootstrapping entity or use a broad default policy.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - Step 1: Create an IAM user or role (`BootstrapperUser`) with `AdministratorAccess` policy attached in your AWS account.
  - Step 2: Configure AWS CLI or SDK to use credentials of `BootstrapperUser`.
  - Step 3: Initialize a RheocerOS application (e.g., `app = AWSApplication("test-app", "us-east-1")`) using the `BootstrapperUser` credentials.
  - Step 4: Inspect the created IAM Dev Role (`test-app-us-east-1-IntelliFlowDevRole`) in the AWS console. Verify that the Dev Role has overly permissive policies attached, potentially mirroring the `AdministratorAccess` of the `BootstrapperUser`. Examine the attached policies to understand the effective permissions.
  - Step 5: As an attacker, assume the created IAM Dev Role (`test-app-us-east-1-IntelliFlowDevRole`) using any authorized user or by exploiting a separate vulnerability to inject code into a RheocerOS workflow.
  - Step 6: Attempt to access resources or perform actions that should not be permitted by a least privilege role, such as creating new IAM users, accessing S3 buckets outside the application's scope, or launching EC2 instances.
  - Step 7: If the attacker is successful in performing privileged actions using the assumed Dev Role, the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 3. Overly Permissive Bootstrapper IAM Role

- **Description:**
  1. RheocerOS requires an initial "bootstrapper" entity with AWS credentials to set up the application's development IAM role.
  2. The documentation and examples encourage users to utilize AWS credentials with overly broad permissions, such as "AdministratorAccess" or permissions capable of creating and deleting IAM roles.
  3. This "bootstrapper" entity's credentials are used to create the application-specific development IAM role (`<app_name>-<aws_region>-IntelliFlowDevRole`).
  4. If an attacker gains access to these overly permissive bootstrapper credentials, they inherit the extensive rights associated with those credentials.
  5. Consequently, the attacker can leverage these permissions to perform unauthorized actions within the user's AWS environment, beyond the intended scope of the RheocerOS application itself.

- **Impact:**
  If the bootstrapper IAM role is compromised:
  1. **High Impact:** While not directly within the RheocerOS application's runtime, compromise of the bootstrapper role is a high impact issue because:
  2. **Unauthorized Access**: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's AWS account with the permissions granted to the bootstrapper role.
  3. **Data Breach**: Attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored within the AWS account, depending on the permissions of the bootstrapper role.
  4. **Resource Manipulation**: Attacker could create, modify, or delete AWS resources within the account, leading to service disruption or financial loss.
  5. **Lateral Movement**: In a more complex scenario, the attacker could use the compromised bootstrapper role to further compromise other resources or accounts within the AWS environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project creates a dedicated development IAM role (`<app_name>-<aws_region>-IntelliFlowDevRole`) for the application which *should* have more limited permissions than the bootstrapper role during runtime, but this does not mitigate the risk if bootstrapper credentials are leaked.
  - The README.md and user guide mention that for quick prototyping, "admin" access can be used, but also suggest more restrictive permissions for production use by stating "AWS Entity represented by the credentials should have the rights to: create/delete/modify the prospective dev-role of the application which is to be created". This is weak guidance and doesn't actively enforce least privilege.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Enforce Least Privilege for Bootstrapper Role**: The project lacks explicit mechanisms or strong documentation to guide users in restricting the bootstrapper entity's IAM role to the absolute minimum permissions necessary for initial setup. The documentation should strongly discourage the use of admin roles even for prototyping.
  - **Security Hardening Guidance**: There is insufficient security guidance within the project documentation that warns against using overly permissive "admin" roles for bootstrapping and recommends specific least privilege IAM policies for the bootstrapper entity.
  - **Automated Least Privilege Policy Generation**: The project does not offer tools or scripts to automatically generate a least privilege IAM policy for the bootstrapper role based on the actual actions performed during the bootstrapping process. A script that analyzes the required actions and outputs a minimal IAM policy would be beneficial.
  - **Credential Rotation/Temporary Credentials:** Guidance on using temporary credentials for the bootstrapper role and rotating credentials regularly should be provided.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. The user utilizes AWS credentials with overly permissive IAM roles (e.g., AdministratorAccess or custom roles with excessive permissions) as the "bootstrapper" entity when initiating RheocerOS.
  2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to these bootstrapper credentials through methods external to RheocerOS (e.g., compromised development environment, credential leakage, insider threat, insecure storage of credentials).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. **File: /code/README.md**
     - The README file mentions the credential requirements for the bootstrapper entity:
       ```markdown
       Credentials:

       * As described within the sample codes below, these examples rely on default AWS credentials on your machine (e.g ~/.aws/credentials or env variables used by boto).
       * AWS Entity represented by the credentials should have the rights to:
         * create/delete/modify the prospective dev-role of the application which is to be created
         * Or do anything / admin :)
       ```
     - This indicates that the code is designed to function even with admin-level credentials, and the documentation even suggests it for prototyping, increasing the potential impact if these credentials are compromised.

  2. **File: /code/doc/user_guide/USER_GUIDE.md**
     - The User Guide reinforces the credential requirements and the "admin" suggestion for bootstrapping:
       ```markdown
       # automatically reads default credentials
       # default credentials should belong to an entity that can either:
       #  - do everything (admin, use it for quick prototyping!)
       #  - can create/delete roles (dev role of this app) that would have this app-name and IntelliFlow in it
       #  - can get/assume its dev-role (won't help if this is the first run)
       app = AWSApplication("alarm-demo", "us-east-1")
       ```
     - The examples consistently suggest using credentials capable of administrative actions, highlighting the vulnerability stemming from this practice.

  3. **File: /code/src/intelliflow/api_ext.py** and **File: /code/src/intelliflow/core/application/application.py**
     - While these files contain the core logic for `AWSApplication` initialization and IAM role creation, they do not enforce any restrictions on the permissions of the bootstrapper role.
     - The `AWSApplication` class primarily focuses on creating and managing the application's dev-role and related resources, implicitly assuming the bootstrapper entity has sufficient privileges.
     - There's no code within these files that actively mitigates the risk of overly permissive bootstrapper roles. The code is designed to work under the assumption that the bootstrapper entity has the necessary (and potentially excessive) permissions.

  4. **File: /code/examples/onboarding.py**, **File: /code/examples/email_action_example.py**, **File: /code/examples/hello_world.py**, **File: /code/examples/hello_world_cruise_control.py** and other examples
     - Many example files across the `/code/examples` directory reinforce the practice of using potentially overly permissive "default credentials" for bootstrapping through comments as described in the original vulnerability report.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup**:
     - Create an AWS IAM user specifically for testing RheocerOS bootstrapping. Let's call it `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper`.
     - Grant this `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user the `AdministratorAccess` AWS managed policy.
     - Configure your local AWS environment (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`) to use the access keys of the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user.
     - Install RheocerOS and its dependencies in a test environment.

  2. **Vulnerability Trigger**:
     - Initialize an `AWSApplication` instance using the default credentials (which will now use `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user).
     - Activate the RheocerOS application:
       ```python
       from intelliflow.api_ext import AWSApplication
       app = AWSApplication("bootstrapper-vuln-test-app", "us-east-1") # Replace with your desired app name and region
       app.activate()
       ```
     - In a separate step, simulate an attacker gaining access to the credentials of the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user. This could be simulated by simply using these credentials directly in another AWS session or programmatically accessing them if they were stored insecurely.

  3. **Exploit and Verification**:
     - Using the compromised `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` credentials, attempt to perform an administrative action *outside* the intended scope of RheocerOS application management, but within the permissions of `AdministratorAccess`. For example, try to:
       - Create a new IAM user with full administrative privileges:
         ```python
         import boto3
         iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
         try:
             response = iam_client.create_user(UserName='attacker-admin-user')
             print("Successfully created attacker admin user!")
         except Exception as e:
             print(f"Failed to create attacker admin user, but attempted: {e}")
         ```
     - **Expected Result**:
       - The test should successfully create the "attacker-admin-user" IAM user, demonstrating that the attacker, using the compromised bootstrapper credentials, can perform administrative actions unrelated to RheocerOS, confirming the vulnerability.
       - If the user creation is successful, the vulnerability is validated.

  4. **Cleanup**:
     - Delete the "attacker-admin-user" IAM user created in the test.
     - Terminate and delete the RheocerOS application:
       ```python
       app.terminate()
       app.delete()
       ```
     - Revoke the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user and apply a least privilege policy instead, if desired, for future bootstrapping operations.
