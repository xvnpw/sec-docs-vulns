### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Bootstrapper IAM Role

- Description:
  1. RheocerOS requires an initial "bootstrapper" entity with AWS credentials to set up the application's development IAM role.
  2. The documentation and examples encourage users to utilize AWS credentials with overly broad permissions, such as "AdministratorAccess" or permissions capable of creating and deleting IAM roles.
  3. This "bootstrapper" entity's credentials are used to create the application-specific development IAM role (`<app_name>-<aws_region>-IntelliFlowDevRole`).
  4. If an attacker gains access to these overly permissive bootstrapper credentials, they inherit the extensive rights associated with those credentials.
  5. Consequently, the attacker can leverage these permissions to perform unauthorized actions within the user's AWS environment, beyond the intended scope of the RheocerOS application itself.

- Impact:
  If the bootstrapper IAM role is compromised:
  1. **Unauthorized Access**: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's AWS account with the permissions granted to the bootstrapper role.
  2. **Data Breach**: Attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored within the AWS account, depending on the permissions of the bootstrapper role.
  3. **Resource Manipulation**: Attacker could create, modify, or delete AWS resources within the account, leading to service disruption or financial loss.
  4. **Lateral Movement**: In a more complex scenario, the attacker could use the compromised bootstrapper role to further compromise other resources or accounts within the AWS environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The project creates a dedicated development IAM role (`<app_name>-<aws_region>-IntelliFlowDevRole`) for the application with potentially more limited permissions than the bootstrapper role.
  - The README.md and user guide mention that for quick prototyping, "admin" access can be used, but also suggest more restrictive permissions for production use by stating "AWS Entity represented by the credentials should have the rights to: create/delete/modify the prospective dev-role of the application which is to be created".

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Enforce Least Privilege for Bootstrapper Role**: The project lacks explicit mechanisms or documentation to guide users in restricting the bootstrapper entity's IAM role to the absolute minimum permissions necessary for initial setup.
  - **Security Hardening Guidance**: There is no clear security guidance within the project documentation that warns against using overly permissive "admin" roles for bootstrapping and recommends specific least privilege IAM policies for the bootstrapper entity.
  - **Automated Least Privilege Policy Generation**: The project does not offer tools or scripts to automatically generate a least privilege IAM policy for the bootstrapper role based on the actual actions performed during the bootstrapping process.

- Preconditions:
  1. The user utilizes AWS credentials with overly permissive IAM roles (e.g., AdministratorAccess or custom roles with excessive permissions) as the "bootstrapper" entity when initiating RheocerOS.
  2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to these bootstrapper credentials through methods external to RheocerOS (e.g., compromised development environment, credential leakage).

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **File: /code/README.md**
     - The README file mentions the credential requirements for the bootstrapper entity:
       ```markdown
       Credentials:

       * As described within the sample codes below, these examples rely on default AWS credentials on your machine (e.g ~/.aws/credentials or env variables used by boto).
       * AWS Entity represented by the credentials should have the rights to:
         * create/delete/modify the prospective dev-role of the application which is to be created
         * Or do anything / admin :)
       ```
     - This indicates that the code is designed to function even with admin-level credentials, increasing the potential impact if these credentials are compromised.

  2. **File: /code/doc/user_guide/USER_GUIDE.md**
     - The User Guide reinforces the credential requirements and the "admin" suggestion for bootstrapping:
       ```markdown
       # automatically reads default credentials
       # default credentials should belong to an entity that can either:
       #  - do everything (admin, use it for quick prototyping!)
       #  - can create/delete roles (dev role of this app) that would have this app-name and IntelliFlow in it
       #  - can get/assume its dev-role (won't help if this is the first run)
       app = AWSApplication("alarm-demo", "us-east-1")
       ```
     - The examples consistently suggest using credentials capable of administrative actions, highlighting the vulnerability.

  3. **File: /code/src/intelliflow/api_ext.py** and **File: /code/src/intelliflow/core/application/application.py**
     - While these files contain the core logic for `AWSApplication` initialization and IAM role creation, they do not enforce any restrictions on the permissions of the bootstrapper role.
     - The `AWSApplication` class primarily focuses on creating and managing the application's dev-role and related resources, assuming the bootstrapper entity has sufficient privileges.
     - There's no code within these files that actively mitigates the risk of overly permissive bootstrapper roles. The code is designed to work under the assumption that the bootstrapper entity has the necessary (and potentially excessive) permissions.

  4. **File: /code/examples/onboarding.py**, **File: /code/examples/email_action_example.py**, **File: /code/examples/hello_world.py**, **File: /code/examples/hello_world_cruise_control.py** and other examples
     - Many example files across the `/code/examples` directory, such as `onboarding.py`, `email_action_example.py`, `hello_world.py`, and `hello_world_cruise_control.py`, start with the comment:
       ```python
       # automatically reads default credentials
       # default credentials should belong to an entity that can either:
       #  - do everything (admin, use it for quick prototyping!)
       #  - can create/delete roles (dev role of this app) that would have this app-name and IntelliFlow in it
       #  - can get/assume its dev-role (won't help if this is the first run)
       app = AWSApplication(app_name, "us-east-1")
       ```
     - This recurring comment in the examples reinforces the practice of using potentially overly permissive "default credentials" for bootstrapping, which aligns with and exemplifies the identified vulnerability. The examples, intended for user guidance, inadvertently promote a less secure bootstrapping approach.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Create an AWS IAM user specifically for testing RheocerOS bootstrapping. Let's call it `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper`.
     - Grant this `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user the `AdministratorAccess` AWS managed policy.
     - Configure your local AWS environment (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`) to use the access keys of the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user.
     - Install RheocerOS and its dependencies in a test environment.

  2. **Vulnerability Trigger**:
     - Initialize an `AWSApplication` instance using the default credentials (which will now use `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user).
     - Activate the RheocerOS application:
       ```python
       from intelliflow.api_ext import AWSApplication
       app = AWSApplication("vuln-test-app", "us-east-1") # Replace with your desired app name and region
       app.activate()
       ```
     - In a separate step, simulate an attacker gaining access to the credentials of the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user. This could be simulated by simply using these credentials directly in another AWS session or programmatically accessing them if they were stored insecurely.

  3. **Exploit and Verification**:
     - Using the compromised `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` credentials, attempt to perform an administrative action *outside* the intended scope of RheocerOS application management, but within the permissions of `AdministratorAccess`. For example, try to:
       - Create a new IAM user with full administrative privileges:
         ```python
         import boto3
         iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
         try:
             response = iam_client.create_user(UserName='attacker-admin-user')
             print("Successfully created attacker admin user!")
         except Exception as e:
             print(f"Failed to create attacker admin user, but attempted: {e}")
         ```
     - **Expected Result**:
       - The test should successfully create the "attacker-admin-user" IAM user, demonstrating that the attacker, using the compromised bootstrapper credentials, can perform administrative actions unrelated to RheocerOS, confirming the vulnerability.
       - If the user creation is successful, the vulnerability is validated.

  4. **Cleanup**:
     - Delete the "attacker-admin-user" IAM user created in the test.
     - Terminate and delete the RheocerOS application:
       ```python
       app.terminate()
       app.delete()
       ```
     - Revoke the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the `test-rheoceros-bootstrapper` IAM user and apply a least privilege policy instead, if desired, for future bootstrapping operations.
