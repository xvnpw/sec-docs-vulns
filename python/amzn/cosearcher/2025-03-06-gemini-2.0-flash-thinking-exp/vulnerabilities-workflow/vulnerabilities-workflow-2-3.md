### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Bing API Key Exposure via Malicious Script Modification
- Description:
    1. A user clones the CoSearcher repository to use the conversational search refinement tool.
    2. Following the instructions in the README.md, the user obtains a Bing API key to utilize the Bing facet functionality.
    3. The user is instructed to execute the `main.py` script with the `--bing-key` argument to provide their API key.
    4. An attacker with malicious intent crafts a modified version of the `src/main.py` script.
    5. This modified script is designed to exfiltrate the Bing API key when executed, for example by printing it to the console or sending it to a remote server, in addition to performing the intended functions of the original script.
    6. The attacker deceives the user into downloading and running this malicious script, possibly through social engineering, distributing it through untrusted channels, or compromising the user's system.
    7. When the user runs the malicious script with their Bing API key, the script executes as intended for the CoSearcher application but also secretly transmits the API key to the attacker.
    8. The attacker successfully obtains the user's Bing API key.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access and usage of the victim's Bing API key by the attacker.
    - Potential financial implications for the victim, especially if the Bing API usage is billed based on consumption or if the attacker's usage exceeds free tier limits.
    - Risk of data access or manipulation if the compromised Bing API key grants access to sensitive information or functionalities beyond the intended use in this project (though less likely in this specific context).
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project, in its current state, does not implement any specific measures to prevent the exfiltration of the Bing API key if a user runs a modified version of the script. It relies on the user's security awareness and trust in the source of the code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Although not a direct mitigation against exfiltration via script modification, validating the format or content of the API key within the script could potentially detect some forms of accidental exposure or misuse, but it won't prevent malicious exfiltration.
    - Security warning in documentation: Adding a clear warning in the README.md about the importance of running code from trusted sources and the risks associated with providing API keys as command-line arguments. This warning should advise users to be cautious about running modified scripts from untrusted sources.
    - Suggest secure API key handling: The documentation could recommend more secure methods for handling API keys, such as using environment variables or dedicated configuration files instead of passing them directly as command-line arguments. This would reduce the risk of exposure through command history or process listings, though not directly prevent exfiltration from a modified script.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must intend to use the Bing facet functionality of the CoSearcher application.
    - The user must have obtained a valid Bing API key.
    - The user must download and attempt to run a modified version of the `src/main.py` script provided or linked to by the attacker.
    - The user must execute the malicious script and provide their Bing API key as a command-line argument as instructed in the README for the original script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/main.py`
    ```python
    import argparse
    ...
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    ...
    parser.add_argument("--bing-key", type=str)
    ...
    args = parser.parse_args()
    ...
    facet_retriever = {
        ...
        "bing": lambda: facet_retrieval.BingFacetRetriever(
            args.bing_key,
            args.bing_cache,
            ...
        ),
        ...
    }[args.facet]()
    ```
    - The `argparse` module is used to handle command-line arguments. The `--bing-key` argument is defined, and its value is directly assigned to `args.bing_key` after parsing the command-line input.
    - When the user selects either the "bing" or "graph-bing" facet option, an instance of `BingFacetRetriever` is created in `/code/src/facet_retrieval.py`.
    - Critically, the user-provided `args.bing_key` is passed directly as an argument to the `BingFacetRetriever` constructor.
    - A malicious modification to `src/main.py` could easily access the `args.bing_key` variable after parsing but before it is used by `BingFacetRetriever` and exfiltrate its value without affecting the intended functionality of the script in most cases. For example, a few lines of code could be added after `args = parser.parse_args()` to print `args.bing_key` to standard output or send it over the network to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Preparation:**
        - Create a modified version of `/code/src/main.py` and save it as `/code/src/main_malicious.py`. Insert the following code snippet right after the line `args = parser.parse_args()` in `/code/src/main_malicious.py` to exfiltrate the API key by printing it to standard output:
        ```python
        if args.bing_key:
            print(f"**POTENTIAL API KEY EXFILTRATION** - API Key: {args.bing_key}")
        ```
        - Optionally, for a more realistic scenario, the attacker could set up a simple web server to receive exfiltrated keys and modify the malicious script to send the `args.bing_key` to this server via an HTTP request instead of printing to stdout.

    2. **Victim Action:**
        - The victim clones the original CoSearcher repository from a legitimate source.
        - The attacker convinces the victim (via social engineering, a phishing attack, or by hosting the modified script on a compromised or look-alike repository) to download and use the malicious script `/code/src/main_malicious.py` instead of the original `/code/src/main.py`.
        - The victim, intending to use the Bing facet functionality, executes the malicious script with their Bing API key, following the usage instructions from the legitimate README but using the malicious `main_malicious.py`:
        ```sh
        python3 src/main_malicious.py --facet bing --bing-key YOUR_ACTUAL_BING_API_KEY
        ```

    3. **Verification of Vulnerability:**
        - After the victim executes the command, observe the output in the terminal.
        - If the API key is successfully exfiltrated, the output will contain the line: `**POTENTIAL API KEY EXFILTRATION** - API Key: YOUR_ACTUAL_BING_API_KEY`, clearly displaying the API key that was provided as a command-line argument.
        - If the attacker implemented remote exfiltration, check the logs of the attacker's web server to confirm that the Bing API key was successfully received.

    This test case demonstrates that a modified script can easily access and exfiltrate the Bing API key when it is provided as a command-line argument, confirming the vulnerability.
