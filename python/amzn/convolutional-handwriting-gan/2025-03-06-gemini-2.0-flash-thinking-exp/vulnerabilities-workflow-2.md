## Combined Vulnerability List

### Path Traversal in Dataset Loading

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Dataset Loading
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can craft a malicious dataset by replacing image files within the expected dataset structure (e.g., IAM, RIMES, CVL datasets in the `Datasets` directory) with symbolic links or by providing paths with traversal sequences.
    - These malicious datasets can be designed to point to files or directories outside the intended dataset directory on the user's file system.
    - When the `create_text_data.py` script processes this maliciously crafted dataset to generate an LMDB file, the script, through image processing libraries, follows these symbolic links or path traversal sequences.
    - Specifically, the `createDataset` function in `create_text_data.py` uses `PIL.Image.open(imagePath)` to open image files based on the provided paths.
    - This can lead to the script accessing and potentially embedding content of arbitrary files from the user's system into the generated LMDB dataset.

    **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
    1.  **Malicious Dataset Creation (Symbolic Links):** Download a legitimate dataset (e.g., IAM, RIMES, or CVL) and place it in the `Datasets` directory. Identify image files within the dataset and replace some with symbolic links pointing to sensitive files outside the dataset directory (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    2.  **Malicious Dataset Creation (Path Traversal Sequences):** Create a dataset with image paths in a list file (e.g., `malicious_images.txt`) that contain path traversal sequences like `../../malicious_dataset/sensitive_data.txt`.
    3.  **Execution of `create_text_data.py`:** Run the `create_text_data.py` script to generate an LMDB file from this modified dataset. Configure the script to process the malicious dataset.
    4.  **Image Processing:** The `create_text_data.py` script processes the dataset. When it encounters symbolic links or path traversal sequences during image loading (using PIL's `Image.open`), it follows these links or sequences.
    5.  **Information Embedding:** The content of the files pointed to by the symbolic links or resolved by path traversal sequences is read and potentially embedded into the generated LMDB file as image data.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system where the `create_text_data.py` script is executed.
    - The content of these files gets embedded into the generated LMDB dataset. If this LMDB dataset is then shared or used in further processes, it could inadvertently expose sensitive information.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code does not implement any explicit checks to prevent path traversal during dataset processing or LMDB generation. The script naively opens and processes files based on paths found within the dataset structure without validating if these paths remain within the intended dataset boundaries.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Sanitization and Validation:** Implement checks within `create_text_data.py` to sanitize and validate all file paths before opening them. This should include verifying that resolved paths (after following symbolic links and resolving traversal sequences) still reside within the expected dataset root directory. Use `os.path.abspath` to resolve paths and check if they are within allowed directories.
    - **Symbolic Link Handling:** Implement secure handling of symbolic links. Options include:
        - Preventing symbolic link following altogether during dataset processing.
        - Resolving symbolic links and then strictly validating that the resolved path is within the allowed dataset directory.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the dataset structure and file paths before processing to ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain path traversal sequences.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker can create a malicious dataset and make it accessible to users. This could be achieved by tricking a user into downloading a compromised dataset from an untrusted source.
    - A user downloads and attempts to process this malicious dataset using `create_text_data.py`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/data/create_text_data.py`
    - **Function:** `createDataset`
    - **Vulnerable code snippet:**
      ```python
      def createDataset(image_path_list, label_list, outputPath, mode, author_id, remove_punc, resize, imgH, init_gap, h_gap, charminW, charmaxW, discard_wide, discard_narr, labeled):
          # ...
          for i in tqdm(range(nSamples)):
              imagePath = image_path_list[i] # Potentially malicious path from dataset
              label = label_list[i]
              # ...
              try:
                  im = Image.open(imagePath) # Vulnerable line, opens file based on potentially malicious path
              except:
                  continue
              # ...
      ```
    - The `imagePath` variable, derived from `image_path_list`, is directly used in `PIL.Image.open()`. `Image.open()` from PIL (Pillow) by default follows symbolic links and resolves path traversal sequences. If `image_path_list` is populated with path traversal strings or contains symbolic links pointing outside the dataset directory, `Image.open()` might follow these paths, leading to files being opened outside the intended dataset directory. No path validation or sanitization is performed before opening the file.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a directory named `malicious_dataset`. Inside, create `sensitive_data.txt` with "This is sensitive data.".
    2. **Malicious Path List:** Create `generate_malicious_list.py` in `/code/data` to generate `malicious_images.txt` containing path traversal:
       ```python
       import os
       malicious_paths = ["../../malicious_dataset/sensitive_data.txt"]
       malicious_labels = [""] * len(malicious_paths)
       # ... (rest of the script to write lists to files) ...
       ```
    3. **Run Path List Generator:** `python /code/data/generate_malicious_list.py`.
    4. **Modify `create_text_data.py`:** In `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, comment out dataset-specific path generation and read from `malicious_images.txt` and `malicious_labels.txt`.
    5. **Run `create_text_data.py`:** `python /code/data/create_text_data.py`.
    6. **Verification:** Examine the created LMDB database (`lmdb_malicious_dataset`) or check for errors. If the script runs without errors, further investigate if `sensitive_data.txt` was accessed by examining LMDB content or file metadata changes. Alternatively, check for errors related to file access, which might indicate an attempt to open out-of-directory file.
    7. **Symbolic Link Test (Alternative):**  Follow steps in the "Path Traversal during LMDB creation" vulnerability description to replace an image in IAM dataset with a symlink to `/etc/passwd` and run `create_text_data.py` for IAM dataset. Verify if `/etc/passwd` content is in the generated LMDB.


### Path Traversal in `--dataname` argument

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in `--dataname` argument
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can potentially exploit a path traversal vulnerability by manipulating the `--dataname` argument in `train.py`, `train_semi_supervised.py`, and `generate_wordsLMDB.py` scripts.
    - The `--dataname` argument is used to look up a dataset path in `data/dataset_catalog.py`.
    - If the `--dataname` argument is not properly sanitized, an attacker could provide a malicious value (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) that, when used to construct file paths, could lead to accessing files outside the intended dataset directory.

    **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
    1. An attacker executes `train.py`, `train_semi_supervised.py`, or `generate_wordsLMDB.py` scripts.
    2. The attacker provides a maliciously crafted `--dataname` argument, such as `../../../../sensitive_data`.
    3. The scripts use this argument to look up the `dataroot` from the `datasets` dictionary in `data/dataset_catalog.py`.
    4. `data/dataset_catalog.py` directly uses the provided `--dataname` to retrieve the path from the `datasets` dictionary without any sanitization.
    5. The scripts then use the retrieved path to open an LMDB environment using `lmdb.open()`. If the crafted `--dataname` leads to a path outside the intended directory, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to the file system.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, configuration files, or other critical data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No explicit mitigations are implemented in the provided code to sanitize or validate the `--dataname` argument. The code directly uses the provided string to look up paths in the `dataset_catalog.py` file.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement input sanitization and validation for the `--dataname` argument.
        - **Whitelisting:** Validate if the provided `--dataname` is within an expected list of dataset names defined in `dataset_catalog.py`.
        - **Path validation:** After retrieving the path from `dataset_catalog.py`, verify that the resolved path is still within the intended dataset directory and prevent access to paths outside of it.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `train.py`, `train_semi_supervised.py`, or `generate_wordsLMDB.py` scripts with command-line arguments.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess valid file paths on the system to traverse to.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/options/base_options.py`
        - The `BaseOptions.initialize()` function defines the `--dataname` argument without any sanitization.
        - The `BaseOptions.gather_options()` function retrieves `dataroot` using `dataset_catalog.datasets[output_opt.dataname]` directly, without validation.
    - **File:** `/code/data/dataset_catalog.py`
        - The `datasets` dictionary maps dataset names to paths. It is directly accessed using the attacker-controlled `--dataname`.
    - **File:** `/code/data/text_dataset.py`
        - In `TextDataset.__init__()`, `opt.dataroot` (derived from `--dataname`) is used in `lmdb.open(os.path.abspath(opt.dataroot))`. `os.path.abspath` resolves the path but does not prevent traversal if the initial path is malicious.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Assume a running environment where `train.py` can be executed. Create `/tmp/sensitive_test_file.txt` with "This is a secret!".
    2. **Execution:** Run `train.py` with a crafted `--dataname`:
       ```bash
       python code/train.py --dataname '../../../../tmp/sensitive_test_file' --name_prefix test_traversal
       ```
       Adjust `--dataname` based on the project root's location relative to `/tmp`.
    3. **Verification:** Check script output/error logs. If the script tries to open `/tmp/sensitive_test_file` as LMDB and fails (as it's not a valid LMDB), it confirms path traversal. The goal is to show the script attempts to access the file specified by path traversal. Success is indicated by errors related to opening a non-LMDB file, implying the script attempted to access it.
