- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Model Checkpoint Loading in `load_model` function
    - Description: The `load_model` function in `mt_sample.py` and `sample.py` is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe loading of model checkpoints using `torch.load`. An attacker can supply a malicious checkpoint path, leading to the execution of arbitrary code during model loading.
    - Impact: Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Input validation: Implement validation for the `checkpoint` argument to ensure it conforms to expected filename and path patterns, restricting potentially harmful characters or path traversal sequences.
        - Path sanitization: Sanitize the provided path to prevent directory traversal exploits. Utilize functions like `os.path.basename` to extract only the filename and ensure the path remains within the designated `checkpoint` directory.
        - Secure checkpoint loading: Investigate and adopt safer methods for loading checkpoints. If `torch.load` must be used, consider implementing additional security checks such as cryptographic signature verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of checkpoint files.
        - Principle of least privilege: Deploy the application with minimal necessary permissions to restrict the potential damage from code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Preconditions:
        - The attacker must be able to influence the `checkpoint` argument, typically through command-line arguments or configuration settings if exposed by the application.
        - The attacker needs to place a maliciously crafted checkpoint file in a location accessible to the application process.
    - Source Code Analysis:
        - In `sample.py` (and similarly in `mt_sample.py`), the `load_model` function uses `torch.load(os.path.join('checkpoint', checkpoint))` to load model checkpoints.
        - The `checkpoint` variable, derived directly from user input, is concatenated with 'checkpoint' using `os.path.join` and passed to `torch.load` without any validation or sanitization.
        - `torch.load` is known to be susceptible to arbitrary code execution when handling untrusted data because it can deserialize arbitrary Python objects, including those designed to execute code upon loading.
    - Security Test Case:
        1. Craft a malicious checkpoint file named `malicious.pt`. This file should contain Python code that executes upon being deserialized by `torch.load`. A common technique involves creating a custom Python class with a `__reduce__` method that contains the malicious payload (e.g., printing "Vulnerable" to a file or executing a system command).
        2. Place the `malicious.pt` file in the `/tmp/` directory of the system where the application is intended to run.
        3. Execute the `sample.py` script (or `mt_sample.py`) with a modified command-line argument to load the malicious checkpoint. For example:
           ```bash
           python sample.py --pixelsnail_ckpt '/tmp/malicious.pt' --ckpt_epoch 1 --pixelsnail_ckpt_epoch 1 --dataset cifar10 --architecture vqvae --selection_fn vanilla
           ```
           If the application expects only the filename and prepends the 'checkpoint' directory:
           ```bash
           python sample.py --pixelsnail_ckpt '../malicious.pt' --ckpt_epoch 1 --pixelsnail_ckpt_epoch 1 --dataset cifar10 --architecture vqvae --selection_fn vanilla
           ```
        4. Monitor for the execution of the malicious code. Check for the "Vulnerable" string in the hypothetical log file, or observe any other side effects indicating code execution, such as unexpected file modifications or network activity. If successful, this confirms the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
