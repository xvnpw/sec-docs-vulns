* Vulnerability Name: Deserialization vulnerability when loading model checkpoints
* Description:
    The project uses `torch.load` to load model checkpoints from files. The `torch.load` function, by default, uses Python's `pickle` module for deserialization. `pickle` is known to be insecure when loading data from untrusted sources because it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. A malicious actor could craft a manipulated checkpoint file containing malicious code. When a user loads this malicious checkpoint file using the project's scripts, the code embedded in the checkpoint will be executed, potentially compromising the user's system. The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a malicious checkpoint file through any script that uses the `load_model` function or directly loads checkpoints using `torch.load`.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious PyTorch checkpoint file (e.g., `malicious_checkpoint.pt`) that contains embedded malicious code.
    2. Attacker makes the malicious checkpoint file available to potential victims, for example, by hosting it on a website or sharing it through a public repository, or sending via email.
    3. Victim, intending to use a pre-trained model or resume training, downloads or otherwise obtains the malicious checkpoint file.
    4. Victim uses one of the project's scripts (e.g., `sample.py`, `mt_sample.py`, `train_vqvae.py`, `train_pixelsnail.py`, `train_fista_pixelsnail.py`, `extract_code.py`) to load the downloaded checkpoint file.
    5. When the script executes `torch.load` on the malicious checkpoint file, the embedded malicious code is deserialized and executed on the victim's machine.
* Impact:
    Critical. Arbitrary code execution. A successful exploit can allow an attacker to gain full control over the victim's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The project uses `torch.load` without any security measures to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Use `torch.load` with `pickle_module=safetensors` if the safetensors library is suitable for the project's needs. Safetensors is a safer alternative to pickle for serializing and deserializing tensors.
    - If `pickle` must be used, load checkpoints in a sandboxed environment or with extreme caution.
    - Implement integrity checks for checkpoint files, such as digital signatures, to verify that the checkpoint has not been tampered with.
    - Provide clear warnings in the documentation about the risks of loading checkpoints from untrusted sources.
* Preconditions:
    - The victim must download or otherwise obtain a malicious checkpoint file from an untrusted source.
    - The victim must execute one of the project's scripts that loads the checkpoint file using `torch.load`.
* Source Code Analysis:

    1. **`sample.py` and `mt_sample.py`**:
        - File: `/code/sample.py` and `/code/mt_sample.py`
        - Function: `load_model`
        - Code snippet:
          ```python
          ckpt = torch.load(os.path.join('checkpoint', checkpoint))
          ```
        - Vulnerability: The `load_model` function in `sample.py` and `mt_sample.py` directly uses `torch.load` to load checkpoint files without specifying `allow_pickle=False` or using a safer `pickle_module`. This makes it vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker can replace the legitimate checkpoint file with a malicious one. When a user tries to sample using a malicious checkpoint, arbitrary code will be executed.

    2. **Training scripts (`train_vqvae.py`, `train_pixelsnail.py`, `train_fista_pixelsnail.py`)**:
        - Files: `/code/train_vqvae.py`, `/code/train_pixelsnail.py`, `/code/train_fista_pixelsnail.py`
        - Checkpoint loading in training scripts: The training scripts also load checkpoints to resume training or load pre-trained VQVAE models for PixelSnail training.
        - Code snippet example from `/code/train_fista_pixelsnail.py`:
          ```python
          ckpt = {}
          if args.pixelsnail_ckpt is not None:
              ckpt = torch.load(args.pixelsnail_ckpt)
              args = ckpt['args']
          ```
        - Vulnerability: Similar to `sample.py`, these scripts also use `torch.load` insecurely when loading existing checkpoints, making training processes vulnerable to malicious checkpoints if a user is tricked into using one.

    3. **`extract_code.py`**:
        - File: `/code/extract_code.py`
        - Checkpoint loading in code extraction script: The `extract_code.py` script loads VQVAE checkpoints to extract codes.
        - Code snippet:
          ```python
          model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint_path), strict=False)
          ```
        - Vulnerability:  `extract_code.py` is also vulnerable as it uses `torch.load` to load model checkpoints without security measures.

    In all these cases, the use of `torch.load` without proper safeguards creates a deserialization vulnerability.
* Security Test Case:

    1. **Craft a malicious checkpoint file:**
        - Create a Python file (e.g., `malicious_payload.py`) with the following code to create a malicious payload:
          ```python
          import torch
          import pickle
          import os

          class MaliciousPayload:
              def __reduce__(self):
                  return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # command to execute

          payload = MaliciousPayload()
          torch.save({'model': payload}, 'malicious_checkpoint.pt')
          ```
        - Run `python malicious_payload.py` to generate `malicious_checkpoint.pt`. This script creates a checkpoint that, when loaded, will execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned` on a Linux system, creating a file `/tmp/pwned` as proof of concept.

    2. **Prepare the environment:**
        - Set up the SparseVQVAE project environment as described in the `README.md`.
        - Place the `malicious_checkpoint.pt` file in the `checkpoint/` directory of the project, or in a location that can be specified to the scripts.

    3. **Run a vulnerable script with the malicious checkpoint:**
        - Execute `sample.py` (or any other script that loads a checkpoint, e.g., `mt_sample.py`, `train_vqvae.py`, `extract_code.py`) and point it to load the malicious checkpoint. For example, modify `sample.py` to load `malicious_checkpoint.pt` directly or use command line arguments if available to specify checkpoint path.  For example, in `sample.py`, temporarily modify the `load_model` function to directly load the malicious checkpoint:
          ```python
          def load_model(...):
              ckpt = torch.load('checkpoint/malicious_checkpoint.pt') # Modified line
              ...
          ```
        - Run `python sample.py --pixelsnail_ckpt_epoch 1 --ckpt_epoch 1` (or similar command to execute a script that loads the model).

    4. **Verify the exploit:**
        - After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system. If the file exists, it confirms that the malicious code embedded in `malicious_checkpoint.pt` was executed when `torch.load` was called, demonstrating the deserialization vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates arbitrary code execution by loading a crafted malicious checkpoint file, confirming the deserialization vulnerability in the SparseVQVAE project.
