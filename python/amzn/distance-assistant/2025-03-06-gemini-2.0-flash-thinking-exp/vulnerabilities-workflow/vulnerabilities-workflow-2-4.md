### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Privileged Docker Container Host Escape

- Description:
    1. The `docker run` command in `README.md` for local execution includes the `--privileged` flag.
    2. Running a Docker container with `--privileged` grants it almost all capabilities of the host operating system kernel.
    3. An attacker who gains code execution within the DistanceAssistant application inside the Docker container (through an unrelated vulnerability in the application, or by malicious container image replacement) can leverage these elevated privileges.
    4. From within the privileged container, the attacker can access and manipulate host resources, including devices, file system, and processes.
    5. Specifically, the attacker can use standard techniques to escape the Docker container and gain root-level access on the host operating system. This could involve mounting the host's root filesystem, accessing Docker socket, or exploiting kernel vulnerabilities exposed by the `--privileged` flag.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Successful exploitation allows a complete compromise of the host operating system. The attacker gains root-level privileges on the host, enabling them to:
        - Steal sensitive data from the host system.
        - Install malware or backdoors on the host.
        - Disrupt host system operations.
        - Pivot to other systems accessible from the compromised host.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project documentation explicitly instructs users to run the Docker container with the `--privileged` flag for local execution.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Remove the `--privileged` flag**: The most effective mitigation is to avoid using the `--privileged` flag in production or any environment where security is a concern.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: If certain functionalities truly require elevated privileges, carefully analyze and grant only the necessary capabilities instead of using `--privileged`. Docker's capability system should be used to fine-tune permissions.
    - **Security Audits of Containerized Application**: Regularly audit the DistanceAssistant application for vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution inside the container, as this is the primary entry point for exploiting the privileged container vulnerability.
    - **Container Security Hardening**: Implement general container security best practices, such as:
        - Running containers as non-root users.
        - Using read-only root filesystems for containers where possible.
        - Applying security profiles (like AppArmor or SELinux) to further restrict container capabilities.
        - Regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - The DistanceAssistant Docker container must be running with the `--privileged` flag on the host system.
    - An attacker must achieve code execution within the DistanceAssistant container. This could be through a separate vulnerability in the DistanceAssistant application itself (not analyzed in provided files, but theoretically possible) or by replacing the container image with a malicious one.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`README.md` - Local Execution Instructions**:
        ```bash
        docker run \
            --gpus=all \
            --net=host \
            --privileged \ # <--- Vulnerable Flag
            --device=/dev/usb \
            --device=/dev/media0 \
            --device=/dev/media1 \
            --device=/dev/video0 \
            --device=/dev/video1 \
            --device=/dev/video2 \
            --device=/dev/video3 \
            --device=/dev/video4 \
            --device=/dev/video5 \
            --env="DISPLAY" \
            --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
            --volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
            -it \
            distance_assistant/prototype
        ```
        - The `README.md` clearly instructs users to use `--privileged` when running the Docker container locally. This makes the system vulnerable by design if an attacker gains access to the container.
    - **`Dockerfile` and Ansible Files**: While the `Dockerfile` and Ansible configuration manage the container image build and deployment, they do not directly introduce or mitigate the `--privileged` vulnerability. The vulnerability is solely due to the documented and suggested `docker run` command.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - A host machine set up according to the `README.md` "Host Setup" instructions.
        - Docker and nvidia-docker installed.
        - The DistanceAssistant Docker image `distance_assistant/prototype` built and available locally, as per "Build Instructions".
        - Ensure the Realsense camera is connected, although it's not strictly necessary to demonstrate the host escape itself.
    2. **Run the DistanceAssistant container as instructed in `README.md` (including `--privileged`)**:
        ```bash
        xhost +local:root
        docker run \
            --gpus=all \
            --net=host \
            --privileged \
            --device=/dev/usb \
            --device=/dev/media0 \
            --device=/dev/media1 \
            --device=/dev/video0 \
            --device=/dev/video1 \
            --device=/dev/video2 \
            --device=/dev/video3 \
            --device=/dev/video4 \
            --device=/dev/video5 \
            --env="DISPLAY" \
            --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
            --volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
            -it \
            distance_assistant/prototype
        ```
    3. **Gain shell access inside the running container**: Once the container is running, use `docker exec` to get a shell inside it:
        ```bash
        docker ps # to get container ID
        docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
        ```
    4. **Attempt to escape the container and access the host filesystem**: Inside the container shell, execute commands to mount the host's root filesystem and then access it. A common technique is to mount the host's `/` directory to a directory inside the container:
        ```bash
        mkdir /host_root
        mount -v --bind / /host_root
        ls /host_root # List the contents of the host's root filesystem
        ```
    5. **Verify successful host access**: If the `ls /host_root` command successfully lists the files and directories of the host's root filesystem, the container escape is successful. This demonstrates that an attacker with code execution inside the container can access and control the host system due to the `--privileged` flag.

This test case proves that running the DistanceAssistant container with `--privileged` creates a critical security vulnerability, allowing container escape and host compromise if an attacker can gain code execution within the container.
