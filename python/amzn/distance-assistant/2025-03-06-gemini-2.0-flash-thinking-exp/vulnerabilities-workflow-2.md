## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Privileged Docker Container and Device Access leading to Potential Host Compromise

- **Description:**
    - The Distance Assistant application is deployed as a Docker container, and the `docker run` command in the `README.md` uses the `--privileged` flag.
    - The `--privileged` flag grants the Docker container almost all capabilities of the host operating system, effectively disabling most of the container isolation mechanisms.
    - Additionally, the `--device` flags map host devices (USB, media, video) directly into the container, providing the container with direct access to these hardware resources.
    - If an attacker can exploit any vulnerability within the Distance Assistant application running inside this privileged container (e.g., through crafted input to the application, exploiting a dependency, or finding a vulnerability in the application logic), they could potentially escalate privileges within the container to root due to the `--privileged` flag.
    - Once root within the privileged container, the attacker could leverage the device mappings and the lack of isolation to escape the container and compromise the host system.
    - This could involve actions such as:
        - Accessing and modifying host filesystems.
        - Interacting with host processes.
        - Installing backdoors on the host.
        - Using host resources for malicious activities.
        - Mounting the host's root filesystem.
        - Accessing Docker socket.
        - Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities exposed by the `--privileged` flag.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical.** Successful container escape can lead to full compromise of the host system.
    - An attacker could gain complete control over the host machine, potentially leading to:
        - Data breach: Access to sensitive data stored on the host system.
        - System takeover: Complete control of the host machine for malicious purposes, such as crypto mining, botnet participation, or further attacks on the internal network.
        - Denial of Service: Rendering the host system and any services it provides unavailable.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None.** The project documentation explicitly instructs users to run the container with `--privileged` and `--device` flags.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Avoid using `--privileged` flag:** The most critical mitigation is to remove the `--privileged` flag from the `docker run` command. This should be done unless absolutely necessary and after a thorough security assessment justifying its use and implementing compensating controls.
    - **Minimize `--device` mappings:** Review the necessity of each `--device` mapping. Only map the absolutely essential devices into the container. If possible, explore alternatives to direct device mapping, such as using Docker volumes or specific capabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  If `--privileged` cannot be avoided, implement the principle of least privilege within the container. Ensure that the Distance Assistant application runs with the minimum necessary user and group privileges inside the container, instead of running as root.
    - **Security Auditing of Application Code:** Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of the Distance Assistant application code to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for container escape. Focus on input validation, dependency vulnerabilities, and general code security best practices.
    - **Container Security Hardening:** Implement container security hardening best practices, such as:
        - Using a minimal base image.
        - Regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities.
        - Implementing a strong security policy within the container (e.g., using security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux if `--privileged` is unavoidable, though their effectiveness is limited with `--privileged`).
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (Capabilities):** If certain functionalities truly require elevated privileges, carefully analyze and grant only the necessary capabilities instead of using `--privileged`. Docker's capability system should be used to fine-tune permissions.
    - **Run containers as non-root users:** Configure the Docker image and container runtime to execute the application as a non-root user inside the container.
    - **Use read-only root filesystems:** Mount the container's root filesystem as read-only to limit write access from within the container.
    - **Apply security profiles:** Utilize security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict container capabilities, even without `--privileged`.
    - **Regularly scan container images:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning for container images to identify and address outdated packages or known vulnerabilities.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The Distance Assistant Docker container must be deployed and running on a host system using the `docker run` command as described in the `README.md`, including the `--privileged` and `--device` flags.
    - An attacker needs to find and exploit a vulnerability within the Distance Assistant application or its dependencies that allows for arbitrary code execution within the container.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **Dockerfile:** The `Dockerfile` itself does not introduce this vulnerability, but it packages the application that is intended to be run in a privileged container.
    - **run.bash:** The `run.bash` script executes the ROS application. If there were a vulnerability in the ROS application itself, the `--privileged` flag would allow it to be escalated to host compromise.
    - **distance_assistant Python code (and Darknet):** While no specific vulnerability is immediately apparent in the provided Python code *that directly leads to container escape*, the complexity of the application (image processing, ROS framework, Darknet integration) increases the likelihood of potential vulnerabilities existing or being introduced in the future.  Any such vulnerability, when combined with `--privileged`, becomes a high-risk security issue.
    - **Ansible scripts:** The Ansible scripts are used for kiosk setup and do not directly introduce the container privilege issue. However, insecure host setup via Ansible could indirectly increase the attack surface.
    - **`README.md` - Local Execution Instructions**: The `README.md` clearly instructs users to use `--privileged` when running the Docker container locally. This makes the system vulnerable by design if an attacker gains access to the container.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the Distance Assistant application on a test host system following the instructions in `README.md`, ensuring the Docker container is run with the `--privileged` and `--device` flags.
        - Obtain access to the running Distance Assistant application (assume external attacker has network access to the application if it exposes any network services, or can trigger actions within the container if there's an exposed interface).
    2. **Vulnerability Trigger (Example - Hypothetical Command Injection):**
        - *Note:* As no specific code vulnerability leading to container escape is immediately identified in the provided files, this test case assumes a *hypothetical* vulnerability exists for demonstration purposes.  A real test case would require finding and exploiting an actual vulnerability in the application.
        - Assume there is a hypothetical command injection vulnerability in `distance_assistant_node.py` that can be triggered through a ROS message or parameter.
        - Craft a malicious ROS message or parameter that exploits this hypothetical command injection vulnerability to execute a command within the container. For example, the command could be `os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')`.
    3. **Verification of Container Root Access (Due to `--privileged`):**
        - If the command injection is successful, verify that the command is executed with root privileges within the container (due to `--privileged`). Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created with root ownership inside the container.
    4. **Container Escape and Host Compromise (Due to `--privileged` and `--device`):**
        - From within the container (after gaining root privileges through the hypothetical command injection), attempt to escape the container and compromise the host.
        - Example escape techniques (due to `--privileged` and device access):
            - Mount the host's root filesystem from within the container (e.g., `mkdir /host_root && mount /dev/sda1 /host_root`).
            - Chroot into the mounted host root filesystem (`chroot /host_root`).
            - Execute commands on the host system, such as creating a backdoor user on the host (`echo 'backdoor::0:0::0::0::/root:/bin/bash' >> /host_root/etc/passwd`).
    5. **Impact Demonstration:**
        - After successful container escape, demonstrate host compromise by:
            - Logging into the host using the backdoor user created in the previous step.
            - Reading sensitive files from the host filesystem.
            - Modifying system configurations on the host.
    6. **Escape the container and access the host filesystem**: Inside the container shell, execute commands to mount the host's root filesystem and then access it.
        ```bash
        mkdir /host_root
        mount -v --bind / /host_root
        ls /host_root # List the contents of the host's root filesystem
        ```
    7. **Verify successful host access**: If the `ls /host_root` command successfully lists the files and directories of the host's root filesystem, the container escape is successful.

### Vulnerability: Insecure X11 Server Exposure via `xhost +local:root`

- **Description:**
    - The DistanceAssistant project, in both its local execution instructions and kiosk setup, utilizes the `xhost +local:root` command.
    - This command disables access control to the X11 server for local connections from the root user.
    - Step 1: An attacker gains limited access to the Docker container, for example by exploiting an unrelated vulnerability within the application or via misconfiguration, or has local access to the host machine.
    - Step 2: From within the Docker container or from a local user session on the host, the attacker leverages the exposed X11 server by setting the `DISPLAY` environment variable to point to the host's X11 server (e.g., `:0`).
    - Step 3: The attacker can now execute graphical applications within the Docker container or from the local session that will be displayed on the host system's X11 server.
    - Step 4: This allows the attacker to interact with the host system's graphical environment, potentially leading to further compromise, such as keylogging, screen capture, or unauthorized access to the video feed from the Realsense camera, compromising the privacy of individuals being monitored. In a kiosk setup, this vulnerability is particularly critical as it can allow a user to break out of the intended kiosk environment and access the underlying operating system.

- **Impact:**
    - **High.** By gaining access to the host's X11 server, an attacker can escalate privileges and compromise the host system or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - This can lead to:
        - **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to the video feed from the Realsense camera and other information displayed by the DistanceAssistant application's GUI.
        - **Information Disclosure:** Potential exposure of other information displayed by the DistanceAssistant application's GUI, which could include configuration details or monitoring statistics.
        - **Abuse of Functionality:** An attacker could potentially inject commands into the X server to interact with the DistanceAssistant application or even other applications running on the X server if other applications are vulnerable to X server attacks.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** In a kiosk environment, breaking out of the intended kiosk application and accessing the underlying operating system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None.** The project explicitly instructs users to use `xhost +local:root` in the README.md for local execution and includes it in the kiosk setup scripts (`xmonad_autostart.sh`).

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Removal of the `xhost +local:root` command:** The most immediate mitigation is to remove or strongly discourage the use of `xhost +local:root` in the documentation and setup instructions.
    - **Use a more secure X server access control method:** Instead of completely opening up the X server, a more restrictive method should be used to grant access only to the Docker container.  Options include:
        - **`xauth`:** Use `xauth` to securely manage access to the X server. Generate a magic cookie and share it only with the Docker container. This requires more complex setup but significantly improves security.
    - **Documentation and Security Best Practices:** Clearly document the security implications of `xhost +local:root` and provide secure alternatives in the `README.md` and any security guidelines.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The DistanceAssistant Docker container must be running on a host system with an X11 server.
    - The user must have followed the project's instructions to run the Docker container, which includes executing `xhost +local:root` or using the kiosk setup which executes this command automatically.
    - An attacker must gain initial, limited access to the Docker container or have local access to the host machine.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `/code/README.md`**: Under "Local Execution Instructions", the README.md explicitly instructs the user to run `xhost +local:root` before executing the Docker container.
    - **File: `/code/distance_assistant_ansible/ansible/roles/da_kiosk/files/xmonad_autostart.sh`**: In the kiosk setup script `xmonad_autostart.sh`, the `xhost +local:root` command is directly embedded.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        Host System (X11 Server) <-----> Docker Container (DistanceAssistant)
                   ^
                   | xhost +local:root
                   |
        Insecure X11 Access
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up DistanceAssistant:** Follow the `Host Setup`, `Build Instructions`, and `Local Execution Instructions` in the `README.md` to build and run the DistanceAssistant Docker container on a test machine. Ensure you execute `xhost +local:root` before running the `docker run` command.
    2. **Gain local access as attacker:** Log in to the test machine as a different local user (or the same user, opening a new terminal). This simulates an attacker with local access.
    3. **Connect to the X server:** Open an `xterm` on the attacker's local session.
        ```bash
        xterm -display :0
        ```
    4. **Verify access to DistanceAssistant display:** Observe the newly opened `xterm` window. It should appear on the same X server display where the DistanceAssistant application is running.
    5. **Capture the application display (optional):** Use `xwd` to capture the entire X server display or a specific window to confirm unauthorized access to the application's visual output.
        ```bash
        xwd -root -display :0 -out display.xwd
        ```
    6. **For kiosk setup:** Follow the kiosk setup instructions in README.md. After kiosk is set up and running, gain access to a shell (e.g. via SSH if enabled, or by physical access and switching TTY). Repeat steps 3-5 from within the kiosk environment to demonstrate the same vulnerability in the kiosk setup.
