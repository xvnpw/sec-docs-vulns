### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: YAML Injection in Pipeline Configuration

- Description:
    1. An external attacker submits a malicious pull request to the repository.
    2. This pull request modifies a YAML file within the `.bazelci/` directory or any file used as a pipeline configuration (e.g., files in `buildkite/pipelines/`).
    3. The malicious YAML file contains executable directives, such as shell commands within `shell_commands` or `batch_commands`, or uses YAML features like `!!python/object/apply:os.system` (if an insecure YAML parser is used, though less likely in this context but worth mentioning for completeness).
    4. If a project member merges this pull request without careful review, the malicious YAML configuration is processed by the CI system.
    5. The Buildkite agent, when executing the pipeline steps, interprets and executes the injected malicious commands, leading to arbitrary code execution on the CI machine.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on Bazel CI machines.
    - An attacker could potentially compromise the Bazel CI infrastructure, steal secrets, modify build processes, or use the CI machines for further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation in `/code/README.md` and `/code/buildkite/README.md` warns about carefully vetting external contributions: "*Please vet external contributions carefully as they can execute arbitrary code on our CI machines*".
    - The "Verify Pull Request" status in Buildkite UI, as described in `/code/README.md` and `/code/buildkite/README.md`, indicates a manual verification step for external contributions.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** The project lacks explicit input validation and sanitization for YAML configuration files. The CI system should implement checks to prevent the execution of arbitrary code embedded within YAML configurations.
    - **Secure YAML Parsing:** Ensure that the YAML parsing library used by `bazelci.py` (likely `PyYAML`) is used securely to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities. Consider using `safe_load` instead of `load` to mitigate potential code execution during YAML parsing.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The CI pipeline execution environment should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential RCE vulnerabilities.
    - **Code Review Enforcement:** Implement mandatory code review policies, especially for changes to CI configuration files, ensuring that at least one or more project members review and approve all pull requests, particularly from external contributors.

- Preconditions:
    - An external attacker needs to submit a pull request to the Bazel Continuous Integration repository.
    - A project member with merge permissions must merge the malicious pull request.
    - The malicious pull request must contain a modified YAML pipeline configuration file with injected code.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/buildkite/bazelci.py` is central to processing CI configurations.
    - The function `load_config` in `/code/buildkite/bazelci.py` is responsible for loading YAML configuration files.
    - The code snippets in `/code/README.md` and `/code/buildkite/README.md` demonstrate the use of YAML to define pipeline steps, including `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, and `run_targets`.
    - If the `load_config` function or subsequent processing of the configuration does not properly sanitize or validate the YAML content, especially the sections that define commands to be executed, it could be vulnerable to YAML injection.
    - The code doesn't show any explicit sanitization or secure loading of YAML configurations within the provided files.
    - Further investigation of `bazelci.py` is needed to confirm the YAML parsing method and the extent of input validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Fork the repository:** Fork the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository to your personal GitHub account.
    2. **Create a malicious branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository, e.g., `malicious-pr`.
    3. **Modify a YAML configuration file:** Edit an existing YAML pipeline configuration file, for example, `/code/pipelines/subpar.yml`. Add a malicious command within the `shell_commands` section. For example, modify the `ubuntu2004` task to include:

    ```yaml
    platforms:
      ubuntu2004:
        shell_commands:
          - echo "Vulnerable to YAML Injection!"
          - touch /tmp/pwned_ci
          - build_targets:
            - "//..."
          - test_targets:
            - "//..."
    ```

    4. **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request from your malicious branch to the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository targeting the `master` branch.
    5. **Wait for CI execution:** If the pull request is merged (this step would ideally be stopped by code review, but for testing purposes, assume it gets merged by a compromised or negligent project member), observe the Buildkite pipeline execution for the affected pipeline.
    6. **Verify code execution:** Check the Buildkite logs for the step corresponding to the modified YAML configuration. Look for the output "Vulnerable to YAML Injection!" and check if the artifact `/tmp/pwned_ci` is created (e.g., by adding an artifact upload step to the malicious YAML). The existence of `/tmp/pwned_ci` artifact would confirm successful code execution.
    7. **Cleanup (important):** After testing, delete the branch and the forked repository to prevent accidental or malicious use of the injected code. Also, notify the `security@bazel.build` team about the findings.
