* Vulnerability Name: YAML Command Injection in Pipeline Configuration
* Description:
    1. An attacker submits a pull request to a Bazel project that uses Bazel CI.
    2. The pull request includes a modified pipeline configuration YAML file (e.g., `.bazelci/presubmit.yml`).
    3. Within the YAML file, the attacker injects malicious commands into fields that are interpreted as shell commands by the CI pipeline execution scripts. For example, using `shell_commands` or `batch_commands`.
    4. A Bazel project maintainer reviews and merges the pull request without carefully inspecting the YAML configuration changes.
    5. The Buildkite pipeline is triggered by the merged pull request, parsing the modified YAML configuration.
    6. Due to the YAML injection, the malicious commands are executed as part of the CI pipeline on Bazel's CI infrastructure.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on Bazel's CI machines.
    - Potential compromise of Bazel's CI infrastructure, including access to secrets, build artifacts, and the ability to tamper with the CI process.
    - Supply chain attacks if the attacker can modify build outputs or inject malicious code into Bazel releases.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The README.md and `/buildkite/README.md` files contain a warning: "*Please vet external contributions carefully as they can execute arbitrary code on our CI machines*". This is only a documentation-based mitigation, not a technical control.
    - The "Verify Pull Request" status in Buildkite is a manual step intended to encourage maintainers to review external contributions, but it relies on maintainer vigilance and doesn't prevent injection if the review is not thorough enough.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for YAML configuration files, especially for fields that are interpreted as commands. The system should not directly execute strings from YAML as shell commands without proper escaping or sandboxing.
    - Principle of least privilege: CI pipeline tasks should run with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing or containerization of CI pipeline tasks to isolate them from the underlying CI infrastructure and prevent broader system compromise.
    - Automated YAML validation and security scanning tools integrated into the CI pipeline to detect potential injection attempts before execution.
    - Code review guidelines and training for maintainers to specifically address YAML injection risks in pipeline configurations.
* Preconditions:
    - The project must be using Bazel CI and Buildkite.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a pull request against a Bazel project repository.
    - A maintainer with merge permissions must review and merge the malicious pull request.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/buildkite/bazelci.py` is mentioned in `README.md` as containing the full list of supported platforms and is responsible for CI script execution. It parses YAML configuration files.
    - The `README.md` shows examples of YAML configuration with `shell_commands`, `batch_commands`, and `run_targets`. These fields are likely injection points if their values are not properly sanitized before being executed by `bazelci.py`.
    - The `pipeslines/*.yml` files provide examples of pipeline definitions that use these YAML features, indicating that these features are indeed used in practice and could be vulnerable.
    - The provided code doesn't include the implementation of `bazelci.py` or related scripts that handle YAML parsing and command execution. Therefore, a deeper analysis of those scripts would be needed to pinpoint the exact vulnerable code locations and confirm the lack of sanitization. However, based on the documentation and examples, the vulnerability is highly probable due to the nature of YAML and shell command execution.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Fork the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository (or any Bazel project using this CI setup).
    2. Create a new branch in your forked repository.
    3. Modify a pipeline configuration YAML file (e.g., create a new one or modify an existing one in the `pipelines/` directory or `.bazelci/presubmit.yml` if applicable to the project).
    4. In the YAML file, within a task definition, add a `shell_commands` (for Linux/macOS) or `batch_commands` (for Windows) section and inject a malicious command. For example:
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          vulnerable_task:
            platform: ubuntu2004
            shell_commands:
              - echo "Vulnerable to YAML Injection!"
              - whoami > /tmp/attack.txt # Example command to write output to a file
        ```
        Or for Windows:
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          vulnerable_task:
            platform: windows
            batch_commands:
              - echo "Vulnerable to YAML Injection!"
              - whoami > C:\attack.txt # Example command to write output to a file
        ```
    5. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
    6. Create a pull request to the original `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository (or the Bazel project you forked).
    7. Wait for the CI pipeline to run for your pull request (if it automatically triggers) or manually trigger it if needed.
    8. After the pipeline run, examine the build logs for the "vulnerable_task".
    9. Check if the injected commands were executed. For example, if you used `whoami > /tmp/attack.txt`, check the artifacts tab for a file named `attack.txt` in the artifacts of the `vulnerable_task` step. If the file exists and contains the output of the `whoami` command, it confirms arbitrary code execution.
    10. Alternatively, observe the Buildkite UI for any unexpected behavior or signs of malicious activity on the CI machines.
    11. **Important:** Do not merge this pull request to the main repository as it contains a security vulnerability. This test case is for demonstration and validation purposes only in a controlled environment.
