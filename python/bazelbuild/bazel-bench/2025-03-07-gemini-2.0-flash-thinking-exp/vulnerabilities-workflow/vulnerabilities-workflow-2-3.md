### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `env_configure`

- Description:
    1. The benchmark tool allows users to specify a configuration file (`--benchmark_config`) or command-line flags to define benchmark units.
    2. Each benchmark unit can include an `env_configure` option, which is intended to be a shell command to configure the project's environment before benchmarking.
    3. In `benchmark.py`, the `_run_benchmark` function, after checking out the project commit, executes the `env_configure` command using `_exec_command` with `shell=True`.
    4. Because `shell=True` is used and the `env_configure` string from the configuration file is directly passed to `subprocess.run` without sufficient sanitization, a malicious user can inject arbitrary shell commands.
    5. By crafting a malicious configuration file with a specially crafted `env_configure` command, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the benchmark tool.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Arbitrary command execution on the server running the benchmark tool. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the benchmarking environment, read sensitive data, modify files, or use the system for further malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: There is no input sanitization or validation on the `env_configure` option in the provided code.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize the `env_configure` command to prevent command injection. This could involve:
        - Whitelisting allowed commands or characters.
        - Using parameterization or argument escaping when executing the command with `shell=True`. However, using `shell=False` and passing arguments as a list is generally recommended for security when possible.
        - Ideally, avoid using `shell=True` altogether for `env_configure` and find a safer way to configure the environment if possible, or restrict the functionality.
    - Input validation: Validate the `env_configure` command to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain potentially harmful characters or command sequences.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious configuration file to the benchmark tool, either by:
        - Modifying an existing configuration file if the tool reads from a user-writable location.
        - Providing the malicious configuration file path via the `--benchmark_config` command-line flag.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`benchmark.py:main(argv)`**:
        ```python
        def main(argv):
            # ...
            config, bazel_clone_repo, project_clone_repo = _get_benchmark_config_and_clone_repos(argv)
            # ...
            for i, unit in enumerate(config.get_units()):
                # ...
                project_clone_repo.git.checkout('-f', project_commit)
                if unit['env_configure'] is not None:
                  _exec_command(
                      unit['env_configure'], shell=True, cwd=project_clone_repo.working_dir)
                # ...
        ```
        - This code snippet shows that for each benchmark unit, if `env_configure` is defined in the configuration, the `_exec_command` function is called with `shell=True` and the `env_configure` value as the command.

    2. **`benchmark.py:_exec_command(args, shell=False, cwd=None)`**:
        ```python
        def _exec_command(args, shell=False, cwd=None):
          logger.log('Executing: %s' % (args if shell else ' '.join(args)))

          return subprocess.run(
              args,
              shell=shell,
              cwd=cwd,
              check=True,
              stdout=sys.stdout if FLAGS.verbose else subprocess.DEVNULL,
              stderr=sys.stderr if FLAGS.verbose else subprocess.DEVNULL)
        ```
        - This function executes the command using `subprocess.run`. When `shell=True`, `args` is expected to be a string, which is directly passed to the shell for execution. This is where the command injection vulnerability lies if `args` (in this case `unit['env_configure']`) is not properly sanitized.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious configuration file named `evil_config.yaml` with the following content:
        ```yaml
        global_options:
          project_source: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc.git
          runs: 1
        units:
         - bazel_commit: b8468a6b68a405e1a5767894426d3ea9a1a2f22f
           env_configure: "echo 'VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED' > /tmp/vulnerability.txt"
           command: build //:all
        ```
        - This configuration sets `env_configure` to a command that will write "VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED" to `/tmp/vulnerability.txt`.

    2. Run the benchmark tool using the malicious configuration file:
        ```shell
        bazel run :benchmark -- --benchmark_config=evil_config.yaml --data_directory=/tmp/bazel-bench-test
        ```
        - Replace `/tmp/bazel-bench-test` with a suitable data directory if needed.

    3. After the benchmark run completes, check if the file `/tmp/vulnerability.txt` exists and contains "VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED":
        ```shell
        cat /tmp/vulnerability.txt
        ```
        - If the file exists and contains the expected content, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability via `env_configure` is present.

    4. Expected result: The file `/tmp/vulnerability.txt` should be created and contain the text "VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED", demonstrating successful command injection. This test case proves that an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands by controlling the `env_configure` option in the configuration file.
