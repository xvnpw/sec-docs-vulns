### Vulnerability List for DrJAX Project

* Vulnerability Name: Input Injection Vulnerability through Unsanitized `map_fn` User Functions
* Description:
    1. An attacker can potentially control or influence the input data processed by a DrJAX application.
    2. The DrJAX application uses `drjax.map_fn` to apply a user-provided function (`fn`) to this data in a distributed manner.
    3. If the user-provided function `fn` is not designed to sanitize or validate its inputs, it becomes vulnerable to input injection attacks.
    4. An attacker can craft malicious input data that, when processed by the unsanitized function `fn` within `map_fn`, leads to unintended and potentially harmful actions.
    5. These actions could include information leakage if `fn` improperly handles sensitive data, data corruption if `fn` modifies data based on malicious input, or other unintended program behaviors depending on the capabilities of `fn` and the nature of the injected input.
    6. DrJAX, by design, does not perform any automatic input sanitization for user-provided functions in `map_fn`, making it the user's responsibility to ensure the security of these functions.
* Impact:
    - Information leakage: Sensitive data processed by the user function might be exposed due to improper handling of malicious inputs.
    - Data corruption: Malicious inputs could cause the user function to modify or corrupt data within the DrJAX computation.
    - Unintended program behavior: Injection could lead to unexpected actions or errors within the distributed computation, disrupting the application's intended functionality.
    - Potential escalation to more severe vulnerabilities: Depending on the specific actions the vulnerable user function can perform and the environment, the impact could escalate beyond data and program integrity.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. DrJAX does not implement any input sanitization or validation mechanisms for user-provided functions in `map_fn`. The security relies entirely on the developers using DrJAX to write secure user-provided functions.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation: Add comprehensive documentation to `drjax.map_fn` and create a dedicated security considerations section in the DrJAX documentation. This documentation must:
        - Explicitly warn users about the critical security risks associated with using unsanitized user-provided functions in `map_fn`.
        - Clearly explain the potential for input injection vulnerabilities if user functions are not carefully designed to handle untrusted or potentially malicious inputs.
        - Provide best practices and guidelines for writing secure user functions for `map_fn`, emphasizing the importance of input sanitization and validation.
        - Include code examples demonstrating how to sanitize inputs within user functions used with `map_fn` for common vulnerability types (e.g., format string injection, command injection if applicable in the user's function context).
* Preconditions:
    1. A DrJAX application is developed and deployed.
    2. This application utilizes the `drjax.map_fn` primitive.
    3. The application passes a user-provided function `fn` as an argument to `drjax.map_fn`.
    4. The function `fn` is not designed with input sanitization or validation measures in place.
    5. An attacker has the ability to influence or control the input data that is processed by `drjax.map_fn` and subsequently passed to the vulnerable user function `fn`. This could be through external input channels to the application or by compromising data sources used by the application.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `drjax/_src/api.py`: The `map_fn` function in the API is defined as a placeholder that raises `OperatorUndefinedError` when called directly, indicating it's intended for use within a `drjax_program` context. The actual implementation is patched in by `_replace_api`.
    2. `drjax/_src/api.py`: The `_replace_api` function dynamically replaces the `map_fn` API function with `map_fn_impl`. This `map_fn_impl` in turn calls `placed_computations.map_to_placement`.
    3. `drjax/_src/impls.py`: The `map_to_placement` function is implemented using `jax.vmap`.  Crucially, `jax.vmap` directly applies the user-provided function `fn` to slices of the input arguments without any intermediate sanitization or validation.
    4. `jax.vmap` in `impls.py`:
       ```python
       mapped_fn = jax.vmap(
           fn,
           in_axes=0,
           out_axes=0,
           spmd_axis_name=placement,
       )
       result = call_jaxpr(mapped_fn, arg)
       ```
       - The code snippet shows that the user-provided function `fn` is passed directly to `jax.vmap`.
       - `jax.vmap` then calls `fn` for each element along the placement axis.
       - There is no sanitization or validation of `arg` (the input to `map_fn`) before it is passed to `fn` within the `jax.vmap` call.
    5. Lack of Sanitization: There is no code within DrJAX (in `api.py`, `impls.py`, or `primitives.py`) that performs any kind of sanitization, validation, or security checks on the inputs that are passed to the user-provided function `fn` within `map_fn`. DrJAX's design relies on the assumption that users will provide secure functions.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Define a simplified DrJAX program to demonstrate the potential vulnerability. This program will use `map_fn` with a vulnerable user-provided function. Assume we have a DrJAX environment set up and running.
    2. **Vulnerable User Function**: Create a Python function that is intentionally vulnerable to a simple form of input injection, for example, by directly printing an input string without sanitization.
       ```python
       import jax.numpy as jnp
       import drjax

       def vulnerable_user_function(input_string):
           print(f"Processing input: {input_string}") # Vulnerable to injection if input_string is attacker-controlled.
           return jnp.array(0.0) # Dummy return value for DrJAX map_fn
       ```
    3. **DrJAX Program**: Define a DrJAX program that utilizes `map_fn` and passes the `vulnerable_user_function`.
       ```python
       @drjax.program(placements={'clients': 2}) # Example placement
       def test_drjax_program(data_input):
           return drjax.map_fn(vulnerable_user_function, data_input)
       ```
    4. **Malicious Input Data**: Craft a malicious input string designed to demonstrate injection. For this example, we will use a simple string that, if not properly handled, could cause unintended output or behavior if the `vulnerable_user_function` were doing something more sensitive than just printing. For a real format string vulnerability, a more crafted string would be used, but for demonstration, a simple potentially problematic string suffices.
       ```python
       malicious_input = jnp.array(["Normal Input", "$(whoami)"]) # Attempt to inject a shell command (for demonstration - actual exploit depends on vulnerable_user_function)
       ```
    5. **Execute DrJAX Program**: Run the DrJAX program with the malicious input.
       ```python
       test_drjax_program(malicious_input)
       ```
    6. **Observe Output**: Examine the output of the program. In this simplified example, the output will likely just print the string `$(whoami)` as is, because `print` in Python is not inherently vulnerable to shell command injection in this way. However, if `vulnerable_user_function` were designed to, for example, execute system commands based on parts of the input string, or perform database queries, or log data in a format susceptible to injection (like older logging systems with format string vulnerabilities), then the malicious input could trigger unintended actions.

       To more directly demonstrate a *potential* vulnerability, imagine if `vulnerable_user_function` was hypothetically designed to log messages in a system known to be vulnerable to format string attacks (which `print` in standard Python isn't). In such a *hypothetical* scenario, providing format string specifiers in `malicious_input` could lead to information disclosure or other unintended consequences.

       The test case demonstrates that DrJAX itself does not prevent passing potentially unsafe or attacker-controlled input strings to user-defined functions within `map_fn`, highlighting the user's responsibility for input sanitization and the need for DrJAX to document this security consideration thoroughly.
