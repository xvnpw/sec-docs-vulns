- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Ingest Module via LocalCopy
- Description:
    - An attacker could craft a malicious filename, such as one containing directory traversal sequences like `../../../`, and provide it as input to the `telluride_decoding` library, specifically to the `ingest` module.
    - The `ingest.LocalCopy` class, designed to create local copies of remote files, takes a `remote_filename` as input.
    - If a user-provided or externally influenced filename is passed as the `remote_filename` to `LocalCopy`, and this filename contains path traversal sequences, the `tf.io.gfile.copy` function within `LocalCopy.__enter__` might follow these sequences.
    - This could allow an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions and access files or directories outside of the expected data storage locations when the library attempts to create a local copy.
    - For example, if the library is processing a configuration file that indirectly leads to the `LocalCopy` class being used with an attacker-controlled filename, a path traversal attack could be mounted.
- Impact:
    - **High**. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system where the `telluride_decoding` library is being used. This could include sensitive configuration files, data files, or even parts of the application code itself, depending on the permissions of the user running the library and the system's file structure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code in `ingest.py` and related files does not appear to implement any sanitization or validation of filenames before passing them to `tf.io.gfile.copy` within the `LocalCopy` class.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement checks in the `ingest` module, specifically within the `LocalCopy` class or any functions that utilize it, to validate and sanitize filenames. This should include:
        - Checking for and removing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
        - Validating that the target path remains within the expected data directories.
        - Using secure path manipulation functions to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the filename that is processed by the `ingest` module and passed to the `LocalCopy` class. This might be through:
        - Crafting a malicious data file that, when processed by the library, leads to the vulnerable code path with a malicious filename.
        - Exploiting a higher-level vulnerability in an application using the library that allows control over filenames passed to the library's functions.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/telluride_decoding/ingest.py`
    - Class: `LocalCopy`
    - Function: `__enter__(self)`
    ```python
    class LocalCopy(object):
      """Create a local (temporary) copy of a file for software.
      ...
      """
      def __init__(self, remote_filename: str):
        self._remote_filename = remote_filename

      def __enter__(self):
        _, suffix = os.path.splitext(self._remote_filename)
        self._fp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix)
        self._name = self._fp.name
        tf.io.gfile.copy(self._remote_filename, self._name, overwrite=True) # Vulnerable line
        return self._name
      ...
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The line `tf.io.gfile.copy(self._remote_filename, self._name, overwrite=True)` in the `LocalCopy.__enter__` function is vulnerable. The `remote_filename` which is directly taken from the class constructor argument, is used in `tf.io.gfile.copy` without any path sanitization.
    - **Step-by-step exploit scenario:**
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious input data file.
        2. This malicious data file, when processed by the `ingest` module, causes the code to call `LocalCopy` with a `remote_filename` that contains path traversal sequences, such as `"../../../sensitive_config.ini"`.
        3. The `LocalCopy` object is instantiated with this malicious filename.
        4. The `with LocalCopy(...) as local_file:` block is executed.
        5. Inside `LocalCopy.__enter__()`, `tf.io.gfile.copy("../../../sensitive_config.ini", local_file_path, overwrite=True)` is executed.
        6. `tf.io.gfile.copy` follows the path traversal sequences, potentially copying the sensitive file `sensitive_config.ini` from outside the intended directory to a temporary location (`local_file_path`).
        7. Although the immediate impact is copying to a temporary file, further vulnerabilities in the application using `telluride_decoding` could expose this copied sensitive file or its contents to the attacker.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious filename string: `malicious_filename = '../../../tmp/attack_file.txt'`
    - Step 2: Create a dummy `BrainDataFile` object that uses `LocalCopy` and pass the `malicious_filename` to it. For example, modify `EdfBrainDataFile` to accept a filename directly in load_all_data and use LocalCopy with it.
    - Step 3: Create a dummy file `/tmp/attack_file.txt` with sensitive content (e.g., "This is a sensitive file.").
    - Step 4: Call `brain_data.BrainTrial.load_brain_data` (or directly call `BrainDataFile.load_all_data` method if you modified it in step 2) with the modified `BrainDataFile` object and ensure that the `malicious_filename` is processed.
    - Step 5: After execution, check if a local temporary file was created containing the content of `/tmp/attack_file.txt`. This would demonstrate path traversal as the code attempted to copy a file from outside the intended scope.
    - Step 6: Verify that the content of the created temporary file matches the content of `/tmp/attack_file.txt`.
