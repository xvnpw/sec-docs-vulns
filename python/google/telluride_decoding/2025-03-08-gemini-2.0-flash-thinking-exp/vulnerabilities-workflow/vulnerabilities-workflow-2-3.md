### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Deserialization in EDF File Ingestion

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious EDF file containing specially crafted headers or signal data.
    2. The victim, intending to process brain data, uses the `ingest` module of the `telluride_decoding` library to ingest this malicious EDF file.
    3. The `ingest_brainvision.py` module, specifically the `EdfBrainDataFile` class and `parse_edf_file` function, uses the `pyedflib` library to parse the EDF file.
    4. Due to a vulnerability in `pyedflib` or insecure handling of the parsed data in `telluride_decoding`, processing the malicious EDF file triggers unsafe deserialization.
    5. This unsafe deserialization allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during the data ingestion process.

- Impact:
    - Impact of vulnerability is **critical**.
    - Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine processing the malicious EDF file.
    - An attacker could gain full control of the victim's system, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or using the compromised system for further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Currently implemented mitigations: None evident from the provided project files. The code relies on external library `pyedflib` for EDF parsing without explicit security measures in `telluride_decoding` itself.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Missing mitigations:
        - Input validation and sanitization for EDF files within `ingest.py` and `ingest_brainvision.py` to detect and reject potentially malicious files before parsing by `pyedflib`.
        - Error handling and safe parsing practices when using `pyedflib` to prevent exceptions from propagating and potentially revealing information or leading to exploitable states.
        - Sandboxing or process isolation for the ingestion module to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        - Regular updates of `pyedflib` library to incorporate security patches for known vulnerabilities.
        - Static analysis of the `ingest` module and `pyedflib` integration points to identify potential vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - Preconditions to trigger vulnerability:
        - The victim must use the `ingest` module to process an EDF file.
        - The attacker must be able to provide or trick the victim into using a maliciously crafted EDF file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code analysis:
        1. **File: /code/telluride_decoding/ingest_brainvision.py**
        2. The `parse_edf_file` function uses `pyedflib.EdfReader` to read EDF files.
        ```python
        with pyedflib.EdfReader(sample_edf_file) as f:
            if not f:
              logging.error('Can not read EDF data from %s', sample_edf_file)
              return None  # pytype: disable=bad-return-type  # gen-stub-imports
            n = f.signals_in_file
            signal_labels = f.getSignalLabels()
            fs_list = f.getSampleFrequencies()
            sigbufs = np.zeros((n, f.getNSamples()[0]))
            for i in np.arange(n):
              sigbufs[i, :] = f.readSignal(i)
            header = f.getHeader()
            signal_headers = f.getSignalHeaders()
        return {'labels': signal_labels,
                'signals': sigbufs,
                'sample_rates': np.array(fs_list),
                'header': header,
                'signal_headers': signal_headers,
               }
        ```
        3. The `EdfBrainDataFile.load_all_data` function calls `parse_edf_file`.
        ```python
        def load_all_data(self, data_dir: str):
            if not tf.io.gfile.exists(data_dir):
              raise IOError('Data_dir does not exist:', data_dir)
            data_filename = os.path.join(data_dir, self._data_filename)
            if not data_filename.endswith('.edf'):
              data_filename += '.edf'
            if not tf.io.gfile.exists(data_filename):
              raise IOError('Can not open %s for reading' % data_filename)
            with LocalCopy(data_filename) as local_filename:
              # Parse this with local file copy because EDF routine doesn't grok Google
              # file systems.
              self._edf_dict = parse_edf_file(local_filename)
        ```
        4. The code directly uses the `pyedflib.EdfReader` to parse the EDF file without any explicit input validation before parsing. If `pyedflib` has vulnerabilities related to parsing specially crafted EDF files, this code could be vulnerable.
        5. The `LocalCopy` class copies the remote file to a local temporary file before parsing, which, while intended for file system compatibility, does not mitigate the unsafe deserialization risk itself.
        6. The `ingest.py` example code shows usage of `BrainExperiment` and `BrainTrial` to ingest data, demonstrating the attack vector in practice.
        ```python
          experiment = ingest.BrainExperiment(trial_dict, '/tmp', '/tmp')
          experiment.load_all_data()
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious EDF File:** Create a malicious EDF file designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in `pyedflib` or common parsing weaknesses (e.g., buffer overflow in header parsing, malicious signal data). This might involve using fuzzing tools against `pyedflib` or researching known EDF vulnerabilities. For example, a crafted EDF header could be created to cause `pyedflib` to allocate an insufficient buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when reading signal data.
    2. **Set up Test Environment:** Ensure you have a testing environment with the `telluride_decoding` library installed.
    3. **Execute Ingestion with Malicious File:** Write a Python script that uses the `telluride_decoding` library to ingest the malicious EDF file. Use code similar to the example in `ingest.py` or `doc/DecodingCodelab.md` to load the data, targeting the `EdfBrainDataFile` class in `ingest_brainvision.py`.
    ```python
    from telluride_decoding import ingest_brainvision
    from telluride_decoding import ingest
    import os

    malicious_edf_file = "malicious.edf" # Path to the malicious EDF file you created.
    data_dir = "/tmp" # Or any temporary directory

    # Assume malicious.edf is placed in /tmp
    brain_data_file = ingest_brainvision.EdfBrainDataFile(malicious_edf_file)
    try:
        brain_data_file.load_all_data(data_dir) # Trigger parsing of the malicious file
        print("Ingestion completed without crashing (Vulnerability might not be directly detectable by crash)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Ingestion failed with exception: {e}")
        print("Vulnerability likely exploitable (Crash or Exception)")

    ```
    4. **Observe Outcome:** Run the script and observe the outcome.
        - **Successful Exploit:** If the test is successful, it might result in:
            - Arbitrary code execution (e.g., spawning a shell, creating a file).
            - A crash of the Python interpreter due to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability.
        - **No Immediate Exploit (but potential vulnerability):** If the script runs without crashing but raises exceptions related to parsing or data handling, it could indicate a vulnerability that requires further investigation to achieve code execution.
        - **No Vulnerability Detected:** If the script processes the file without issues or raises expected validation errors (if input validation exists), it suggests that the specific malicious file does not trigger a vulnerability, but further test cases with different malicious EDF files may be needed.
    5. **Refine and Repeat:** Based on the outcome, refine the malicious EDF file or the test script and repeat the test to further explore the vulnerability or confirm its absence. If a crash or code execution is not immediately achieved, investigate error messages and modify the malicious file or the test case to attempt to trigger a more exploitable condition based on the error feedback.
