### Vulnerability List for DeepConsensus Project

* Vulnerability Name: Integer Overflow in Quality Score Calibration

* Description:
An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the base quality score calibration logic. When applying calibration, the code performs addition and multiplication on quality scores, which are represented as integers. If the calibration parameters (w and b) and the base quality scores are chosen such that their product and sum exceed the maximum value for the integer type used (e.g., int32 in numpy), it can lead to an integer overflow. This overflow can wrap around to negative values, resulting in incorrect, unexpectedly low, or even negative quality scores after calibration. An attacker could craft a malicious input FASTQ/BAM file that, when processed, leads to specific quality scores which, combined with certain calibration parameters, trigger this overflow.

Step-by-step trigger:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious input FASTQ/BAM file. This file does not directly trigger the overflow but sets the stage for it.
2. The user runs DeepConsensus on the malicious input file, potentially with custom or default quality score calibration parameters.
3. During the DeepConsensus run, if quality score calibration is enabled and applied to certain bases, the calculation in `calibration_lib.calibrate_quality_scores` can result in an integer overflow if the input quality scores and calibration parameters are crafted to cause the result to exceed the maximum integer value.
4. The integer overflow leads to incorrect quality scores, potentially causing DeepConsensus to make incorrect base calls or filtering decisions based on these corrupted quality scores.

* Impact:
Incorrect quality scores due to integer overflow can lead to several impacts:
    * **Incorrect base calls:** DeepConsensus relies on quality scores to make informed decisions about base corrections. Corrupted quality scores can degrade the accuracy of the corrected reads, potentially leading to incorrect consensus sequences.
    * **Bypass quality filters:** If the overflow results in unexpectedly low quality scores, reads that should have passed quality filters might be filtered out, reducing the yield of high-quality reads. Conversely, if overflow leads to unexpectedly high quality scores (due to wrap-around and becoming large positive numbers after overflow), low-quality reads might pass filters, decreasing the overall quality of the output.
    * **Unexpected behavior:** The application might behave unpredictably due to incorrect numerical calculations, although arbitrary code execution is unlikely from this specific vulnerability.
    * **Data integrity issues:** Downstream analyses relying on the output FASTQ/BAM files will be based on potentially flawed data, affecting the reliability of results in variant calling, assembly, or other genomic analyses.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. The code in `deepconsensus/quality_calibration/calibration_lib.py` and `deepconsensus/quality_calibration/calculate_baseq_calibration.py` does not include explicit checks or mitigations for integer overflows in quality score calculations.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input validation:** While not directly preventing overflow, validating calibration parameters to ensure they are within reasonable ranges could reduce the likelihood of overflow.
    * **Data type handling:** Using data types that support larger integer ranges or floating-point arithmetic for intermediate calibration calculations could prevent overflow. Ensuring that the final quality scores are capped at a maximum valid value (e.g., 93 for Phred+33) is important but does not prevent overflow during intermediate calculations.
    * **Overflow checks:** Explicitly checking for potential overflow before or after the calibration calculation and handling it gracefully (e.g., by capping the quality scores at maximum values or logging a warning) would mitigate the impact.

* Preconditions:
    * Quality score calibration must be enabled in DeepConsensus. This is enabled by default if calibration parameters are provided, either through command-line flags or loaded from `params.json`.
    * The attacker needs to craft an input FASTQ/BAM file that, when processed by DeepConsensus, results in base quality scores and alignment contexts that, combined with the calibration parameters, lead to an integer overflow in the `calibrate_quality_scores` function.
    * The user must run DeepConsensus on this maliciously crafted input file.

* Source Code Analysis:

1. **File:** `/code/deepconsensus/quality_calibration/calibration_lib.py`
2. **Function:** `calibrate_quality_scores(quality_scores: np.ndarray, calibration_values: QualityCalibrationValues) -> np.ndarray`
3. **Code Snippet:**
```python
  return quality_scores * w_values + b_values
```
4. **Analysis:** This line performs the linear transformation: `calibrated_quality = quality_score * w + b`. `quality_scores` are numpy arrays of integers (typically `np.uint8` or `np.int32`). If `w` and `b` (from `calibration_values`) are chosen appropriately, and if the original `quality_scores` are high enough, the result of the multiplication and addition can exceed the maximum representable value for the integer type, leading to an integer overflow.

5. **Example Scenario:** Assume `quality_scores` is `np.array([60], dtype=np.int32)`, `calibration_values.w` is `2`, and `calibration_values.b` is `2000000000`. The calculation would be `60 * 2 + 2000000000 = 2000000120`. If the integer type is `int32` (max value around 2.1 billion), and if the numpy array is of type `int32`, the result might overflow. While the example uses floating point numbers in python, if the underlying numpy array operations are performed with integer types without overflow checks or proper casting, an overflow can occur, especially in compiled code or when using TensorFlow operations that might implicitly use integer types for intermediate calculations. Although `quality_scores` are capped later, the overflow could happen during the intermediate calculation.

* Security Test Case:

1. **Create a malicious input FASTQ file:** Generate a FASTQ file (e.g., `malicious_input.fastq`) with a read that has high base qualities. For simplicity, a short read is sufficient. The crucial part is high quality scores to make the overflow condition more likely. Example:

```fastq
@malicious_read
ACGT
+
IIII
```
Here, 'I' represents a high quality score (Phred score 40).

2. **Create a DeepConsensus parameter configuration:** Use a configuration file (or command-line arguments) to enable quality calibration and set calibration parameters that are likely to trigger an integer overflow when combined with high quality scores. For example, set `dc_calibration` to `0,2,2000000000`. This sets `threshold=0`, `w=2`, and `b=2000000000`.

3. **Run DeepConsensus with the malicious input and crafted calibration parameters:** Execute the DeepConsensus `run` command, pointing to the malicious FASTQ file as input, the created checkpoint for the model, and specifying the crafted calibration string.

```bash
deepconsensus run \
  --subreads_to_ccs=malicious_input.fastq \
  --ccs_bam=malicious_input.fastq \
  --checkpoint=<path_to_checkpoint> \
  --output=output_corrected.fastq \
  --dc_calibration='0,2,2000000000'
```

4. **Analyze the output FASTQ file:** Inspect the output FASTQ file (`output_corrected.fastq`). Check the quality scores of the corrected reads. If the vulnerability is triggered, you may observe unexpectedly low or negative quality scores in the output, especially for bases that originally had high quality scores in the input FASTQ. You can write a small script to parse the output FASTQ and check for quality scores that are lower than expected or negative, which would indicate an integer overflow. For example, parse the quality string and convert it to numerical scores, and check if any score is less than 0 or significantly lower than the input quality scores, despite the correction process supposed to improve quality.
