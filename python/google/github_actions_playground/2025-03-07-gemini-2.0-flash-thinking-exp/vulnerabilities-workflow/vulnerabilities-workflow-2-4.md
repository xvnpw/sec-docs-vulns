## Vulnerability List

### Insecure Workflow Example leading to Command Injection
**Description:** The repository, intended as a learning sandbox, might contain example workflows that demonstrate insecure practices, such as executing shell commands with user-controlled input without proper sanitization. If users copy and implement these insecure examples in their own GitHub Actions workflows, they could become vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could potentially control parts of the workflow execution by manipulating input variables, leading to arbitrary command execution on the runner environment.

**Impact:** If a user copies an insecure example and uses it in their workflow, an attacker might be able to inject arbitrary commands into the workflow execution. This could lead to:
- Exfiltration of secrets and sensitive data stored in the repository or environment variables.
- Modification of the repository code or workflow files.
- Deployment of malicious code or infrastructure.
- Denial of service or disruption of the workflow execution.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in example workflows demonstrating insecure practices. The provided code in the analyzed files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `/code/Dockerfile`, `/code/action.yml`, `/code/main.py`) is safe, but the repository's purpose as a learning sandbox for workflows increases the risk if insecure examples are present.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- The repository should not contain insecure example workflows without clear warnings.
- If insecure examples are necessary for educational purposes, they must be explicitly marked as insecure and accompanied by secure alternatives and comprehensive explanations of the vulnerability and mitigation strategies.
- Implement automated checks (linters, static analysis) to scan example workflows for potential security vulnerabilities before inclusion in the repository.
- Include a prominent disclaimer in the repository's README, warning users about the potential security risks of copying code from example workflows without thorough review and adaptation to their specific needs.

**Preconditions:**
- The repository contains an example workflow demonstrating insecure command execution (e.g., using `run: | ...` without sanitizing inputs and incorporating user-provided data).
- A user copies this insecure example and integrates it into their own GitHub Actions workflow.
- The insecure workflow is triggered by an event where an attacker can influence the input variables used in the vulnerable command.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Consider a hypothetical example workflow named `insecure_example.yml` within the repository:
```yaml
name: Insecure Workflow Example
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      user_input:
        description: 'User Input'
        required: true

jobs:
  insecure_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run command with user input
        run: |
          echo "Running command with input: ${{ github.event.inputs.user_input }}"
          ls -l ${{ github.event.inputs.user_input }}
```
In this example, the `user_input` obtained from `workflow_dispatch` is directly appended to the `ls -l` command within the `run` step. This direct injection of user-controlled input into a shell command without sanitization creates a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could provide a malicious input string such as `"; rm -rf / #"` via the `user_input` field when triggering the `workflow_dispatch` event. This input, when processed by the workflow, would result in the execution of `ls -l "; rm -rf / #"` which, after the `ls -l` command completes (or fails due to invalid arguments), would execute `rm -rf /`, potentially deleting all files in the runner's workspace.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository and locate the hypothetical `insecure_example.yml` workflow (or create a similar workflow if it doesn't exist for testing purposes).
2. Ensure `workflow_dispatch` trigger is enabled for this workflow.
3. Manually trigger the workflow using `workflow_dispatch`.
4. In the input field for `user_input`, provide the following payload: `"; whoami #"`
5. Examine the workflow execution logs. If the command injection is successful, the output of the `whoami` command will be visible in the logs, demonstrating arbitrary command execution. This confirms the vulnerability as the attacker was able to execute the `whoami` command instead of just listing files.
6. For a more critical severity test, use a payload like `"; cat /etc/passwd #"` to attempt to read sensitive system files, or `"; printenv #"` to check for environment variables. Successful execution of these commands further validates the command injection vulnerability and its potential impact.
