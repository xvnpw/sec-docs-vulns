- ### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Perfetto Trace Analysis
- Description:
  - An attacker crafts a malicious Perfetto trace file specifically designed to exploit a potential SQL injection vulnerability within the `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` library. This library is used by Sherlock to parse and analyze trace data.
  - The attacker then tricks a user into analyzing this malicious trace file using Sherlock's `trace-analysis` mode. The user is unaware of the file's malicious nature and uses Sherlock to process it.
  - Sherlock, in its `trace-analysis` mode, utilizes the `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` to parse the provided trace file.
  - During analysis, Sherlock executes SQL queries against the parsed trace data using `TraceProcessor` (e.g., in modules like `analysis_url.py` which uses `tp.query()`).
  - The malicious trace file is crafted such that when parsed and queried, it injects malicious SQL code into the queries executed by `TraceProcessor`.
  - This injected SQL code is then executed by `TraceProcessor`, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine running Sherlock.
- Impact:
  - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
  - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the system running Sherlock, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The current Sherlock project does not implement any specific mitigations against malicious trace files. It directly utilizes the `perfetto` library without any input validation, sanitization, or sandboxing.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization of the Perfetto trace file content before it is processed by `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor`. This should include checks to ensure the trace file conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
  - Sandboxing the trace analysis process. Running the `trace-analysis` in a restricted environment (e.g., using containers or virtual machines) can limit the impact of successful code execution, preventing attackers from gaining full system access.
  - Regular updates and monitoring of the `perfetto` library for known vulnerabilities. Keeping the `perfetto` dependency updated to the latest version is crucial to patch any security flaws discovered in the library itself.
  - Implementing a policy to only analyze traces from trusted sources. Warn users about the risks of analyzing trace files from untrusted or unknown sources.
- Preconditions:
  - The user must have Sherlock installed and must execute the `trace-analysis` mode.
  - The user must be tricked into analyzing a malicious Perfetto trace file provided by an attacker. This could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting the malicious file on a seemingly legitimate platform.
  - The `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` library must be vulnerable to SQL injection or other types of parsing vulnerabilities that can be exploited through a crafted trace file.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - `src/sherlock/sherlock_analysis.py`: The `TraceAnalysis.run_analysis` method orchestrates the trace analysis process. It iterates through the list of trace files and analysis modules provided.
  - For each trace file and analysis module, it calls `analysis_module.run(trace_filepath)`. This is where the actual trace parsing and analysis take place.
  - `src/sherlock/analysis/analysis_url.py` (example analysis module): The `TraceAnalysisModuleUrl.run` method demonstrates how trace files are processed.
    ```python
    def run(self, trace_filepath: str) -> trace_analysis.TraceAnalysisModuleResult:
        logging.info(
            'Running %s module on trace %s', self.module_name, trace_filepath
        )
        self.trace_filepath = trace_filepath
        results = {}
        for url_id, url in _extract_url_information(
            TraceProcessor(trace=trace_filepath) # TraceProcessor is instantiated here
        ):
            results[url_id] = {'url': url}
        return trace_analysis.TraceAnalysisModuleResult(
            module_name=self.module_name,
            trace_filepath=trace_filepath,
            results=results,
        )
    ```
    - Inside `analysis_url.py`, `TraceProcessor(trace=trace_filepath)` is instantiated with the user-provided `trace_filepath`. This `TraceProcessor` instance is then used to execute SQL queries against the trace data using `tp.query()`.
    - The code directly passes the user-provided trace file to the `TraceProcessor` without any prior validation or sanitization. If `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` has vulnerabilities in its parsing or query execution logic, a malicious trace file could exploit these vulnerabilities.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Setup
    - Install Sherlock and its dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Create a directory to store the malicious trace file, e.g., `/tmp/malicious_traces/`.
    - Craft a malicious Perfetto trace file named `malicious.pftrace`. This file should be designed to exploit a hypothetical SQL injection vulnerability in the `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` library when processing SQL queries.  *(Note: Creating a real malicious trace file requires deep understanding of `perfetto` internals and potential vulnerabilities, which might require dedicated security research. For testing purposes, you might need to simulate a vulnerable scenario or use a known vulnerable version of `perfetto` if one exists and is publicly documented.)*
    - Place the `malicious.pftrace` file inside the `/tmp/malicious_traces/` directory.
  - Step 2: Execution
    - Execute Sherlock in `trace-analysis` mode, specifying the directory containing the malicious trace file and using the `ANALYSIS_URL` module.
      ```bash
      python sherlock.py trace-analysis --traces-directory /tmp/malicious_traces --module ANALYSIS_URL
      ```
  - Step 3: Verification
    - Monitor the execution of Sherlock. Successful exploitation of a SQL injection vulnerability could manifest in several ways, such as:
      - Sherlock crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
      - Error messages related to SQL parsing or execution.
      - If the vulnerability allows for more advanced exploitation, it might be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution. In a controlled test environment, you could attempt to make the exploit create a file on the file system, establish a network connection, or perform other observable actions that would indicate successful code execution.
    - Examine the output logs and any generated report files for anomalies or signs of successful exploitation.

This test case is designed to demonstrate the *potential* for a SQL injection vulnerability. The actual success of the test depends on the existence of such a vulnerability in the `perfetto.trace_processor.TraceProcessor` library and the ability to craft a trace file that effectively exploits it. If a real vulnerability exists, this test case provides a framework for verifying and demonstrating it within the context of the Sherlock tool.
