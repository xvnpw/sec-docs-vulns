### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified security vulnerabilities within the ImageMix application. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, severity ranking, current mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

#### 1. Path Traversal in Image Layer Filename

- **Description:**
    An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability by crafting a malicious Google Sheet template for ImageMix. This template, specifically in the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet, contains a manipulated `filename` value. This malicious filename includes path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) designed to navigate outside the intended image directory within the user's Google Drive. When a user, unaware of this malicious template, uses it with ImageMix in Google Colaboratory, the script processes the attacker-controlled filename. The `Image.open()` function then attempts to open a file at the attacker-specified path, potentially accessing sensitive files outside the intended image directory on the user's Google Drive.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files from the user's Google Drive. If the Google Colaboratory environment and Python libraries permit file access based on the traversed path, confidential data could be exposed. While direct file content reading might be restricted in some Colaboratory setups, the attempt to access files outside the intended directory is a security breach and could be leveraged for further attacks if other vulnerabilities exist or are introduced. In scenarios where the application's functionality expands to include file writing or manipulation, this path traversal could escalate to overwriting or modifying critical files.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The application lacks any input validation or sanitization for filenames obtained from the Google Sheet. The provided filename is directly used in file operations without any security checks to prevent path traversal attacks.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation for the `filename` field within the `SpreadsheetLoader.get_image_layers` function. This should include:
        - **Path Sanitization:** Remove or neutralize path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `./`) from the filename. Ensure paths are resolved relative to the intended image directory.
        - **Filename Validation:** Validate that the filename contains only allowed characters and does not include harmful sequences.
        - **Path Normalization:** Normalize paths to remove redundant separators and resolve relative paths to absolute paths within the allowed image directory.
    - **Restrict File Access:** Limit the application's file access permissions to the intended image directory, preventing access to other parts of the file system to minimize the impact of path traversal attempts.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. **Malicious Google Sheet Template:** The attacker must create and share a malicious Google Sheet template containing the path traversal payload.
    2. **User Adoption of Malicious Template:** A victim user must use the attacker's malicious Google Sheet template URL in their Google Colaboratory environment.
    3. **Execution of ImageMix Script:** The user must execute the ImageMix script within Google Colaboratory, configured to utilize the malicious Google Sheet template.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. **`src/image_mix/spreadsheet_loader.py` - `SpreadSheetLoader.get_image_layers`:**
        ```python
        def get_image_layers(self) -> list[image_layer_lib.ImageLayer]:
            # ...
            for index, row in enumerate(all_rows_image_layer):
                # ...
                try:
                    image_layer = image_layer_lib.ImageLayer(
                        layer_id=row[_IMAGE_LAYER_ID_COLUMN],
                        position_x=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_POSITION_X_COLUMN]),
                        position_y=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_POSITION_Y_COLUMN]),
                        width=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_WIDTH_COLUMN]),
                        height=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_HEIGHT_COLUMN]),
                        file_path=os.path.join(self._image_directory_path,
                                                row[_IMAGE_LAYER_FILE_NAME_COLUMN])) # Vulnerable line
                    image_layers.append(image_layer)
                # ...
        ```
        The vulnerability lies in the line where `file_path` is constructed. The `get_image_layers` function retrieves the filename directly from the Google Sheet (`row[_IMAGE_LAYER_FILE_NAME_COLUMN]`) and joins it with `self._image_directory_path` using `os.path.join`.  While `os.path.join` is safer than string concatenation, it does not prevent path traversal if the filename from the sheet *already contains* traversal characters like `../`.  The function trusts the filename from the external Google Sheet without any validation.

    2. **`src/image_mix/image_layer.py` - `ImageLayer` class:**
        ```python
        @dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
        class ImageLayer(base_layer.BaseLayer):
            # ...
            file_path: str

            def __post_init__(self):
                super().__post_init__()
                if not self.file_path:
                    raise ValueError('file_path cannot be empty')
                # ...
        ```
        The `ImageLayer` class stores the `file_path` directly as provided, without any validation against path traversal. The only check is to ensure the `file_path` is not empty. This class acts as a data container and does not implement any security measures.

    3. **`src/image_mix/layer_mixer.py` - `LayerMixer._add_image_layer`:**
        ```python
        def _add_image_layer(self, layer: image_layer.ImageLayer) -> None:
            """Adds an image layer on top of the image.
            Args:
            layer: An image layer to add on top of the image.
            """
            image_binary = Image.open(layer.file_path) # Vulnerable line
            # ...
        ```
        The `_add_image_layer` function is the point of exploitation. It uses `Image.open(layer.file_path)` to open the image file.  `Image.open()` from the PIL library directly attempts to open the file at the path specified in `layer.file_path`. If `layer.file_path` contains path traversal sequences (like `../../../sensitive_file.txt`), `Image.open()` will follow these sequences, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory. There is no sanitization or validation of the path before file access.

        **Visualization:**

        ```
        Google Sheet (Attacker Controlled) --> SpreadsheetLoader --> ImageLayer (file_path: malicious) --> LayerMixer --> Image.open(malicious_file_path) --> File System Access (Potential Path Traversal)
        ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Ensure ImageMix is installed in Google Colaboratory, and a Google Drive folder is set up as the image directory. Create a test file named `sensitive_test.txt` in your Google Drive root, outside the image directory.
    2. **Create Malicious Google Sheet:** Copy the ImageMix Google Sheet template. In the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet, add a new row with `filename`: `../../../sensitive_test.txt`.
    3. **Modify Colaboratory Notebook:** Open the ImageMix notebook, replace `spreadsheet_url` with the malicious sheet URL, and set `image_directory_path` to your image directory.
    4. **Run ImageMix Script:** Execute the cell in the notebook that runs `image_mixer.generate_creatives()`.
    5. **Observe and Verify:** Check for `FileNotFoundError` or similar errors indicating an attempt to access the traversed path. Examine the output image for unexpected content or corruption if the script proceeds. Monitor file system access logs (if possible) for definitive confirmation of path traversal attempts.
    6. **Expected Outcome:** The script should ideally throw an error due to attempted access outside the intended directory, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.


#### 2. Text Injection through Google Sheet

- **Description:**
    A text injection vulnerability exists in ImageMix due to the lack of sanitization of text content from the Google Sheet. An attacker who gains unauthorized edit access to the Google Sheet template can inject malicious or misleading text into the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet, specifically within the `text_content` column. When an authorized user runs the ImageMix script with this compromised Google Sheet, the script reads the attacker's injected text and renders it directly onto the generated image creative. This can lead to the dissemination of misinformation, phishing attempts via embedded links, or brand damage through offensive content.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**. The impact of this vulnerability is significant:
        - **Misinformation and propaganda:** Attackers can inject false narratives and propaganda into advertisements.
        - **Phishing and scams:** Embedding deceptive text with phishing links can lead to user credential theft and financial losses.
        - **Brand damage:** Offensive or inappropriate text injection can severely damage brand reputation and customer trust.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. There are no input sanitization, validation, or output encoding mechanisms implemented for text content originating from the Google Sheet. The `text_content` is used directly as read from the spreadsheet without any security processing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of `text_content` in `spreadsheet_loader.py` within `get_text_layers()`. This should neutralize potentially harmful characters or markup using HTML entity encoding or a dedicated sanitization library.
    - **Content Validation:** Introduce validation checks on `text_content` in `text_layer.py` within the `TextLayer` class. Validate text against expected patterns or character sets, restricting content types using regular expressions or content security policies to filter out risky text.
    - **Output Encoding:** Apply proper output encoding in `layer_mixer.py` within `_add_text_layer()` when rendering text. Ensure text is rendered as plain text, preventing unintended interpretation of malicious characters as code or markup during image creation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Attacker Gains Edit Access:** The attacker must gain unauthorized edit access to the Google Sheet template. This could be through compromised credentials, social engineering, or exploiting misconfigured sharing settings.
    - **User Executes ImageMix with Compromised Sheet:** An authorized user must execute the ImageMix script using the compromised Google Sheet URL.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/src/image_mix/spreadsheet_loader.py` - `get_text_layers()`:**
        ```python
        text_layer = text_layer_lib.TextLayer(
            layer_id=row[_TEXT_LAYER_ID_COLUMN],
            position_x=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_POSITION_X_COLUMN],
            position_y=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_POSITION_Y_COLUMN]),
            font_size=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_FONT_SIZE_COLUMN]),
            font_file_path=self._default_font_file_path,
            color_r=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_R_COLUMN]),
            color_g=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_G_COLUMN]),
            color_b=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_B_COLUMN]),
            text_content=row[_TEXT_LAYER_TEXT_CONTENT_COLUMN]) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        The `text_content` is directly extracted from the Google Sheet (`row[_TEXT_LAYER_TEXT_CONTENT_COLUMN]`) and assigned to the `TextLayer` object without any sanitization or validation. Any content in the Google Sheet will be used verbatim.

    - **`/code/src/image_mix/layer_mixer.py` - `_add_text_layer()`:**
        ```python
        def _add_text_layer(self, layer: text_layer.TextLayer) -> None:
          """Adds a text layer on top of the image."""
          font = ImageFont.truetype(layer.font_file_path, layer.font_size)
          draw = ImageDraw.Draw(self._image)
          draw.text(layer.position(), layer.text_content, layer.rgb_color(), font) # Vulnerable line
        ```
        The `draw.text()` function directly renders `layer.text_content` (which originates unsanitized from the Google Sheet) onto the image. There is no encoding or escaping applied, allowing malicious text to be rendered as is.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Access Google Sheet Template:** Open or copy the ImageMix Google Sheet template.
    2. **Navigate to TEXT_LAYER Sheet:** Open the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet.
    3. **Inject Malicious Text Content:** In the `text_content` column of any row, inject misleading text like: `Watch out for scams! Visit: http://example.com/very-suspicious-site`.
    4. **Save Modified Google Sheet:** Save the changes in the Google Sheet.
    5. **Run ImageMix Script:** Execute the ImageMix script in Google Colaboratory with the modified Google Sheet URL.
    6. **Locate Generated Image Creative:** Find the generated image in the output folder.
    7. **Inspect Generated Image:** Open the image and examine the rendered text.
    8. **Verify Text Injection:** Confirm that the injected malicious text ("Watch out for scams! Visit: http://example.com/very-suspicious-site") is rendered in the image, demonstrating the text injection vulnerability.
