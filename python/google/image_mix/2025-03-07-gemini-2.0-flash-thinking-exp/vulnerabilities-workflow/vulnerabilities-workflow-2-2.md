### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Path Traversal in Image Layer Filename

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Google Sheet template.
    2. In the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet of the template, the attacker inserts a row.
    3. In this row, under the `filename` column, the attacker provides a malicious file path. This path includes path traversal characters such as `../` to navigate outside the intended image directory within the user's Google Drive. For example, the attacker might input a filename like `../../../sensitive_file.txt`.
    4. The user, unaware of the malicious template, uses this Google Sheet URL in Google Colaboratory and runs the ImageMix script.
    5. The `SpreadsheetLoader` reads the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet, including the attacker's malicious filename.
    6. The `ImageLayer` object is created, storing the malicious filename as the `file_path`.
    7. When `LayerMixer` processes this `ImageLayer`, it uses `Image.open(layer.file_path)`.
    8. Due to the path traversal characters in `layer.file_path`, the `Image.open()` function attempts to access a file outside the designated image directory in the user's Google Drive, as specified by the attacker in the Google Sheet.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**. An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the user's Google Drive if the Google Colaboratory environment and Python libraries permit access based on the traversed path.
    - In a more severe scenario (though not directly evident in the provided code, but a potential risk if the script's functionality were expanded), if the application were to include file writing or manipulation based on user-provided paths, a path traversal vulnerability could also lead to overwriting or modifying sensitive files outside the intended output directory.
    - Even if direct file content reading is restricted by the Colaboratory environment, the attempt to access files outside the intended directory is a security breach and could be a stepping stone for more advanced attacks if other vulnerabilities are present or introduced later.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses the filename provided in the Google Sheet without any validation or sanitization. There is no input validation to prevent path traversal characters in the `filename` field of the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation for the `filename` field in the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet within the `SpreadsheetLoader.get_image_layers` function. This should include:
        - **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the filename to remove or neutralize path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `./`). Ensure that the path is always resolved relative to the intended image directory.
        - **Filename Validation:** Validate that the filename consists only of allowed characters and does not contain any potentially harmful sequences.
        - **Path Normalization:** Normalize the path to remove redundant separators and resolve relative paths to absolute paths within the allowed image directory.
    - **Restrict File Access:** Ideally, the application should operate with the least privileges necessary. If possible, limit file access to only the intended image directory and prevent access to other parts of the file system.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. **Malicious Google Sheet Template:** The attacker must be able to create and share a malicious Google Sheet template.
    2. **User Adoption of Malicious Template:** The victim user must copy and utilize this malicious Google Sheet template URL in their Google Colaboratory environment.
    3. **Execution of ImageMix Script:** The user must execute the ImageMix script within Google Colaboratory, configured to use the attacker's malicious Google Sheet template.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. **`src/image_mix/spreadsheet_loader.py` - `SpreadSheetLoader.get_image_layers`:**
        ```python
        def get_image_layers(self) -> list[image_layer_lib.ImageLayer]:
            # ...
            for index, row in enumerate(all_rows_image_layer):
                # ...
                try:
                    image_layer = image_layer_lib.ImageLayer(
                        layer_id=row[_IMAGE_LAYER_ID_COLUMN],
                        position_x=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_POSITION_X_COLUMN]),
                        position_y=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_POSITION_Y_COLUMN]),
                        width=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_WIDTH_COLUMN]),
                        height=int(row[_IMAGE_LAYER_HEIGHT_COLUMN]),
                        file_path=os.path.join(self._image_directory_path,
                                                row[_IMAGE_LAYER_FILE_NAME_COLUMN])) # Vulnerable line
                    image_layers.append(image_layer)
                # ...
        ```
        - The `get_image_layers` function retrieves the filename directly from the Google Sheet (`row[_IMAGE_LAYER_FILE_NAME_COLUMN]`).
        - It then constructs the `file_path` by joining `self._image_directory_path` and the filename from the sheet using `os.path.join`. While `os.path.join` is safer than simple string concatenation, it does not prevent path traversal if the filename from the sheet *already contains* traversal characters like `../`.

    2. **`src/image_mix/image_layer.py` - `ImageLayer` class:**
        ```python
        @dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
        class ImageLayer(base_layer.BaseLayer):
            # ...
            file_path: str

            def __post_init__(self):
                super().__post_init__()
                if not self.file_path:
                    raise ValueError('file_path cannot be empty')
                # ...
        ```
        - The `ImageLayer` class stores the `file_path` without any validation for path traversal vulnerabilities. It only checks if `file_path` is empty.

    3. **`src/image_mix/layer_mixer.py` - `LayerMixer._add_image_layer`:**
        ```python
        def _add_image_layer(self, layer: image_layer.ImageLayer) -> None:
            """Adds an image layer on top of the image.
            Args:
            layer: An image layer to add on top of the image.
            """
            image_binary = Image.open(layer.file_path) # Vulnerable line
            # ...
        ```
        - The `_add_image_layer` function uses `Image.open(layer.file_path)` to open the image file.
        - `Image.open()` from PIL library will attempt to open the file at the exact path specified in `layer.file_path`. If `layer.file_path` contains path traversal sequences, `Image.open()` will follow those sequences, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory.
        - **Visualization:**
        ```
        Google Sheet (Attacker Controlled) --> SpreadsheetLoader --> ImageLayer (file_path: malicious) --> LayerMixer --> Image.open(malicious_file_path) --> File System Access (Potential Path Traversal)
        ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have the ImageMix library installed in your Google Colaboratory environment.
        - Have a Google Drive folder set up as your image directory, as required by ImageMix.
        - Identify a file in your Google Drive that is outside of your image directory but accessible within your Google Drive (for testing purposes, you can create a simple text file named `sensitive_test.txt` in your Google Drive root).

    2. **Create Malicious Google Sheet:**
        - Copy the provided Google Sheet template for ImageMix.
        - Navigate to the `IMAGE_LAYER` sheet.
        - Add a new row with the following data (adjust layer\_id and other columns as needed to fit your template):
            - `layer_id`: `malicious_image`
            - `width`: `100`
            - `height`: `100`
            - `position_x`: `0`
            - `position_y`: `0`
            - `filename`: `../../../sensitive_test.txt`  (This attempts to traverse up three directories from the image directory and access `sensitive_test.txt` in the root of your Google Drive, assuming the image directory is nested).

    3. **Modify Colaboratory Notebook:**
        - Open the `image_mix_notebook.ipynb` or your Colaboratory notebook where you use ImageMix.
        - Replace the `spreadsheet_url` variable with the URL of your newly created malicious Google Sheet.
        - Ensure `image_directory_path` is set to your image directory in Google Drive.
        - Keep the `default_font_file_path` and `output_path` as needed for the script to run.

    4. **Run ImageMix Script:**
        - Execute the cell in your Colaboratory notebook that runs the `image_mixer.generate_creatives()` function.

    5. **Observe and Verify:**
        - **Check for Errors:** If the script attempts to access `../../../sensitive_test.txt` and fails due to permissions or file not found (depending on the Colaboratory environment's file access restrictions), it might still indicate the path traversal attempt. Look for error messages related to file operations.
        - **Examine Output (If Applicable):** In some scenarios, if `sensitive_test.txt` were an image (or if the script doesn't strictly validate file types), and if Colaboratory's environment allows the traversal, the script might proceed. In such a case, the generated creative might contain content from `sensitive_test.txt` or fail in later image processing stages if it's not a valid image format, but the initial `Image.open()` step would have attempted to access the traversed path.
        - **Network/File Access Logs (Advanced):** In a more controlled environment, you could monitor file system access attempts from within the Colaboratory environment to definitively confirm if the script tried to open the file at the traversed path `../../../sensitive_test.txt`.

    6. **Expected Outcome:**
        - Ideally, the script should throw a `FileNotFoundError` or similar error because it's trying to access a file outside the intended image directory. This error, or any indication that the script is attempting to open a file at the traversed path, confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
        - If the script proceeds without error (less likely in a restricted Colab environment if `sensitive_test.txt` is outside allowed paths), and the generated image is corrupted or contains unexpected content, it could also point to the vulnerability being exploited.

By following these steps, you can test and confirm the path traversal vulnerability in the ImageMix script due to unsanitized filename inputs from the Google Sheet.
