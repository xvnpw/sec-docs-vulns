### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Text Injection through Google Sheet
- Description:
  1. An attacker gains unauthorized edit access to the Google Sheet template used by ImageMix. This could be through direct credential compromise, social engineering, or exploiting misconfigured sharing settings.
  2. The attacker navigates to the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet within the Google Sheet template.
  3. In the `text_content` column of any row in the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet, the attacker injects malicious or misleading text content. This content could include:
     - Misinformation or propaganda designed to deceive viewers.
     - Phishing links disguised as legitimate text, aiming to steal user credentials or sensitive information when users interact with the advertisement after seeing it elsewhere.
     - Offensive or harmful statements intended to damage the reputation of a brand or promote hate speech.
  4. An authorized user, unaware of the malicious modifications, runs the ImageMix script in Google Colaboratory, providing the URL of the attacker-modified Google Sheet template.
  5. ImageMix, when executed, reads the configuration data from the provided Google Sheet, including the attacker's injected malicious text content from the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet.
  6. During the image generation process, the `layer_mixer.py` module utilizes the extracted `text_content` directly, without any sanitization or validation, to render text onto the image creative.
  7. The final generated image creative now contains the malicious or misleading text injected by the attacker.
  8. This compromised image creative can then be used in advertising campaigns or other media, potentially leading to harmful consequences such as:
     - Dissemination of misinformation.
     - Successful phishing attacks against users who trust the advertisement.
     - Reputational damage to brands associated with the offensive content.
- Impact:
  - Misinformation and propaganda: Attackers can inject false or misleading information into advertisements, leading to the spread of harmful narratives, manipulation of public opinion, or damage to the reputation of advertised entities.
  - Phishing and scams: By embedding deceptive text containing phishing links, attackers can create advertisements that lure unsuspecting users to malicious websites, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks and financial losses.
  - Brand damage: The injection of offensive, inappropriate, or brand-damaging text can severely harm the reputation and trustworthiness of brands utilizing ImageMix for creative generation, leading to loss of customer trust and business opportunities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The codebase lacks any input sanitization, validation, or output encoding mechanisms for text content originating from the Google Sheet. The `text_content` is processed and rendered directly as read from the spreadsheet.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of the `text_content` within the `spreadsheet_loader.py` module, specifically in the `get_text_layers` function, to neutralize potentially harmful characters or markup before further processing. This could involve techniques like HTML entity encoding or using a library designed to sanitize text inputs.
  - Content Validation: Introduce validation checks on the `text_content` within the `text_layer.py` module, specifically in the `TextLayer` class, to ensure that the text conforms to expected patterns or character sets. Implement restrictions on the type of content allowed, potentially using regular expressions or content security policies to filter out undesirable or risky text.
  - Output Encoding: Apply proper output encoding within the `layer_mixer.py` module, particularly in the `_add_text_layer` function, when rendering text onto the image. This ensures that the text is rendered as plain text and prevents unintended interpretation of malicious characters as executable code or markup during the image creation process.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must obtain edit access to the Google Sheet template. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Compromising the Google account credentials of a user with edit permissions.
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities in Google Sheets' sharing settings to gain unauthorized access.
    - Socially engineering a user with edit permissions into granting access or directly modifying the sheet with malicious content.
  - An authorized user must execute the ImageMix script, using the compromised Google Sheet URL as input, for the malicious text to be incorporated into the generated image creative.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/image_mix/spreadsheet_loader.py`
    - Function: `get_text_layers()`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      text_layer = text_layer_lib.TextLayer(
          layer_id=row[_TEXT_LAYER_ID_COLUMN],
          position_x=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_POSITION_X_COLUMN]),
          position_y=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_POSITION_Y_COLUMN]),
          font_size=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_FONT_SIZE_COLUMN]),
          font_file_path=self._default_font_file_path,
          color_r=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_R_COLUMN]),
          color_g=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_G_COLUMN]),
          color_b=int(row[_TEXT_LAYER_COLOR_B_COLUMN]),
          text_content=row[_TEXT_LAYER_TEXT_CONTENT_COLUMN])
      ```
    - Analysis:
      - The `get_text_layers()` function in `spreadsheet_loader.py` is responsible for extracting text layer configurations from the 'TEXT_LAYER' sheet of the Google Spreadsheet.
      - Critically, the `text_content` for each text layer is directly extracted from the spreadsheet cell `row[_TEXT_LAYER_TEXT_CONTENT_COLUMN]` and assigned to the `text_content` parameter of the `TextLayer` object without any form of sanitization or validation.
      - This direct assignment means that any content present in the 'text_content' column of the Google Sheet, regardless of its nature, will be taken verbatim and used in subsequent image generation steps. There are no checks to ensure the safety, appropriateness, or intended format of this text content at this stage.

  - File: `/code/src/image_mix/layer_mixer.py`
    - Function: `_add_text_layer()`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      def _add_text_layer(self, layer: text_layer.TextLayer) -> None:
        """Adds a text layer on top of the image.
        ...
        """
        font = ImageFont.truetype(layer.font_file_path, layer.font_size)
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(self._image)
        draw.text(layer.position(), layer.text_content, layer.rgb_color(), font)
      ```
    - Analysis:
      - The `_add_text_layer()` function in `layer_mixer.py` is responsible for rendering text onto the image canvas based on the configuration provided in a `TextLayer` object.
      - The line `draw.text(layer.position(), layer.text_content, layer.rgb_color(), font)` is where the text rendering occurs. It directly uses `layer.text_content`—which, as established in the `spreadsheet_loader.py` analysis, originates unsanitized from the Google Sheet—as the text to be drawn.
      - The `draw.text()` method from the PIL library will render the provided text string onto the image. However, it does not inherently sanitize or validate the text content. Therefore, if `layer.text_content` contains malicious or unintended content, it will be directly rendered into the final image.
      - There is no encoding or escaping of the `layer.text_content` before it is passed to `draw.text()`. This absence of output handling further exacerbates the vulnerability, as any malicious or misleading text injected into the Google Sheet will be faithfully reproduced in the generated image without any mitigation.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Access Google Sheet Template:** Open the Google Sheet template provided for ImageMix or create a copy of it to perform testing without affecting the original template.
  2. **Navigate to TEXT_LAYER Sheet:** Locate and open the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet within the Google Sheet template.
  3. **Inject Malicious Text Content:**
     - Identify a row in the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet where you can modify the text content (e.g., the first row with `layer_id` as 'text_layer1').
     - In the `text_content` column for the selected row, replace the existing text with the following misleading text: `Watch out for scams! Visit: http://example.com/very-suspicious-site`. This text simulates a realistic scenario where an attacker might inject harmful or misleading information.
  4. **Save Modified Google Sheet:** Ensure that the changes made to the `TEXT_LAYER` sheet, including the injected malicious text content, are saved in the Google Sheet.
  5. **Run ImageMix Script:**
     - Open Google Colaboratory and execute the ImageMix script as intended, providing the URL of the modified Google Sheet template as input to the script.
     - Ensure that all necessary parameters, such as image directory path, font file path, and output path, are correctly configured for the script to run successfully.
  6. **Locate Generated Image Creative:** After the ImageMix script completes its execution, navigate to the specified output folder in your Google Drive to locate the generated image creative file. The filename will correspond to the `output_filename` specified in the `LAYOUT` sheet for the layout that includes the modified text layer.
  7. **Inspect Generated Image:** Open the generated image creative file using an image viewer.
  8. **Verify Text Injection:** Carefully examine the text rendered in the image creative, specifically looking for the text layer that was modified in step 3.
     - Observe that the injected text, "Watch out for scams! Visit: http://example.com/very-suspicious-site", is now visibly rendered within the image.
  9. **Confirm Vulnerability:**
     - The successful rendering of the injected misleading text in the generated image confirms the Text Injection vulnerability. This demonstrates that arbitrary text content, including potentially harmful or misleading information, can be injected into image creatives by manipulating the Google Sheet template, without any form of sanitization or validation by the ImageMix application.
