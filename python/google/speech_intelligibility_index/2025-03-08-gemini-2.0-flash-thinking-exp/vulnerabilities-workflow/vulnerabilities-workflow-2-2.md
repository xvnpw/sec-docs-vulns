### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential NaN result due to extreme negative noise levels in SII calculation

- Description:
    1. An attacker provides a crafted input with extremely low noise spectrum levels (NSL) to the `sii` function.
    2. Within the `sii` function, specifically in the loop that calculates the Equivalent Masking Spectrum Level (Z), the term `10**(0.1*nsl[i])` is computed. When `nsl[i]` is a very large negative number (e.g., -1000 dB), this term approaches zero.
    3. In the same loop, another term `np.sum(10**(0.1*(B[:i] + 3.32*C[:i]*np.log10(0.89*f[i]/f[:i]))))` is calculated. Under certain conditions, especially when combined with very low NSL values and standard speech spectrum levels, this term can also become very small.
    4. The sum of these two small terms, `10**(0.1*nsl[i]) + np.sum(...)`, can result in a value that is effectively zero or even slightly negative due to floating-point inaccuracies.
    5. The code then attempts to compute the base-10 logarithm of this sum using `np.log10`. If the sum is zero or negative, `np.log10` will return `-inf` or `NaN` respectively.
    6. This `NaN` value propagates through the subsequent calculations in the `sii` function.
    7. Consequently, the final result of the `sii` function becomes `NaN` instead of a valid Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) value.

- Impact:
    - The `sii` function may return `NaN` (Not a Number) when provided with extreme negative noise levels, instead of a valid SII value between 0 and 1.
    - Applications using this library and relying on the `sii` function to return a numerical SII value may encounter unexpected behavior or errors when they receive `NaN`.
    - This could lead to incorrect decision-making in systems that use the SII value for audio processing or analysis.
    - While not a direct system compromise, it represents a flaw in the numerical computation that can undermine the reliability of the library's output.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code includes input shape validations for `ssl`, `nsl`, and `hearing_threshold` to ensure they are vectors of length 18.
    - There are also checks in `input_5p1`, `input_5p2`, `input_5p3` and `band_importance` for input types and shapes.
    - However, there are no checks on the numerical values of `nsl` to prevent them from being excessively negative, which leads to the `NaN` issue.
    - The code uses `np.maximum` and `np.minimum` in other parts of the calculation to clamp values, but not in a way that prevents this specific `NaN` issue.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement checks to validate the range of input `nsl` values. Limit the minimum allowed value for `nsl` to prevent excessively negative inputs that can cause numerical instability. For example, `nsl` values below a certain threshold (e.g., -200 dB, or a more physically plausible lower bound) could be clamped or rejected with an error message.
    - NaN Handling: After the `np.log10` calculation within the loop for `Z`, explicitly check if the result is `NaN` or `-inf`. Implement error handling or value clamping in such cases. For instance, if `np.log10` produces `NaN`, the code could treat it as a minimum possible value (e.g., a very small negative number in dB scale or 0 in linear scale before dB conversion) or raise a warning/exception. Alternatively, clamp the input to `log10` to ensure it's always a small positive number if it risks becoming non-positive.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to control or influence the `nsl` (noise spectrum level) input parameter passed to the `sii` function.
    - In a typical usage scenario, this could occur if the library is used to process audio data where noise levels are derived from external sources or user-provided input, and insufficient validation is performed on these noise levels before calling the `sii` function.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/speech_intelligibility_index/sii.py` (and `/code/speech_intelligibility_index/sii_jax.py`)
    - Function: `sii`
    - Vulnerable code block:
    ```python
      Z = np.zeros(18)
      Z[0] = B[0]
      for i in range(1, 18):
        Z[i] = 10*np.log10(10**(0.1*nsl[i]) +
                           np.sum(10**(0.1*(B[:i] + 3.32*C[:i]*
                                            np.log10(0.89*f[i]/f[:i])))))
    ```
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The code initializes an array `Z` to store the Equivalent Masking Spectrum Level.
        2. It iterates through the frequency bands from index 1 to 17.
        3. In each iteration `i`, it calculates `Z[i]` using the formula that involves `nsl[i]` and a summation of terms from previous bands.
        4. The critical part is the `np.log10(10**(0.1*nsl[i]) + np.sum(...))` calculation.
        5. If `nsl[i]` is a very large negative number, `10**(0.1*nsl[i])` becomes extremely small, approaching zero.
        6. If `np.sum(10**(0.1*(B[:i] + 3.32*C[:i]*np.log10(0.89*f[i]/f[:i]))))` is also sufficiently small, the argument to the outer `np.log10` can become very close to zero, or negative due to floating-point underflow or precision issues.
        7. When `np.log10` is applied to a non-positive number, it results in `NaN` or `-inf`.
        8. This `NaN` value is then assigned to `Z[i]` and propagates through the rest of the `sii` calculation, ultimately leading to a `NaN` final result.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Use Python with the `speech_intelligibility_index` library installed.
    2. **Prepare Input:**
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import speech_intelligibility_index.sii as sii_lib  # or sii_jax as sii_lib

        ssl = np.array([40] * 18)  # Example speech spectrum levels
        nsl = -1000 * np.ones(18)  # Extremely low noise spectrum levels
        hearing_threshold = np.zeros(18) # Default hearing threshold
        ```
    3. **Execute Code:**
        ```python
        result = sii_lib.sii(ssl=ssl, nsl=nsl, hearing_threshold=hearing_threshold)
        print(f"SII Result: {result}")
        is_nan = np.isnan(result)
        print(f"Is NaN: {is_nan}")
        ```
    4. **Verify Result:**
        - Run the Python script.
        - Observe the output. If the "Is NaN" output is `True`, it confirms that the `sii` function returns `NaN` when provided with extremely low noise levels.
        - Expected output will show "SII Result: nan" and "Is NaN: True".
    5. **Interpretation:** The test case demonstrates that by providing maliciously crafted (extremely low) `nsl` input, an attacker can cause the `sii` function to produce a `NaN` result, which can disrupt the normal operation of applications using this library.
