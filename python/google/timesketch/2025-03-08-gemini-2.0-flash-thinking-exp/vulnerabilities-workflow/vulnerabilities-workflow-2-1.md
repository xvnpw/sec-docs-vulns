* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Event Annotations and Timeline Descriptions
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code.
    2. The attacker injects this payload into a Timesketch instance through user-provided content fields such as event annotations or timeline descriptions.
    3. Another user views the timeline or event containing the attacker's annotation or description.
    4. The application renders the attacker's payload without proper sanitization or encoding.
    5. The malicious JavaScript code is executed within the victim's browser session, in the context of the Timesketch application.
* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
    - Data Theft: Malicious scripts can be designed to extract data from the Timesketch interface and send it to an attacker-controlled server.
    - Malicious Actions: An attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as modifying data, creating new sketches, or sharing sketches with unauthorized users.
    - Defacement: The attacker could modify the visual appearance of the Timesketch application for the victim user.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The provided project files do not contain information about implemented mitigations for XSS vulnerabilities in user-provided content. Source code analysis would be required to determine if any sanitization or encoding is in place. Based on the provided files, there's no indication of implemented mitigations.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all user-provided content fields, especially those that are rendered in the UI such as event annotations and timeline descriptions. This should include escaping or encoding user input to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
    - Contextual output encoding: Ensure that user-provided content is properly encoded based on the output context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) to prevent XSS. Use template engines with automatic output encoding enabled.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected malicious code.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have an account with permissions to add annotations or create/edit timelines.
    - The Timesketch application must be vulnerable to XSS, meaning it does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided content before rendering it in the browser.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code analysis is needed to identify the exact code locations where user-provided content is rendered in the UI (frontend-ng or frontend-v3 folders) and to check for the presence of sanitization or output encoding mechanisms.
    - Without access to the source code of the frontend application (e.g., Vue.js components responsible for rendering annotations and timeline descriptions), a detailed source code analysis cannot be performed.
    - Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the components responsible for rendering user content and assess the presence of XSS vulnerabilities.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Login to Timesketch as a user with permissions to create or edit sketches and add annotations.
    2. Create a new sketch or open an existing one.
    3. Navigate to the timeline explorer view.
    4. Add an annotation to an event. In the annotation text field, enter the following payload: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`
    5. Save the annotation.
    6. As a different user, or in a different browser session, view the same sketch and timeline, and access the event with the annotation.
    7. Observe if an alert box with the text "XSS Vulnerability" appears. If it does, the XSS vulnerability is present.
    8. Repeat steps 2-7, but this time inject the payload into the timeline description field (if such a field exists and is rendered for other users).
    9. If the alert box appears again, the XSS vulnerability is also present in the timeline description.
