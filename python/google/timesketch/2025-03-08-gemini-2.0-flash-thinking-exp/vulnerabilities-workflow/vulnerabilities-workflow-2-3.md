- Vulnerability Name: Potential SQL Injection via CSV/JSON Data Upload
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a malicious CSV or JSON file to Timesketch.
    2. The uploaded file contains crafted data designed to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    3. Timesketch processes the uploaded CSV/JSON data, potentially using it to construct SQL queries for database interactions during timeline creation or analysis.
    4. If the data from the CSV/JSON file is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being incorporated into SQL queries, malicious SQL code injected within the uploaded data can be executed.
    5. This can lead to unauthorized database access, data manipulation, or information disclosure.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the Timesketch database.
    - Data exfiltration or manipulation within the database.
    - Potential compromise of the Timesketch application and underlying system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit mention of SQL injection mitigations in the documentation or README files. It's unclear from these files if any input sanitization or parameterized queries are used in the backend.
    - Mitigation status cannot be determined from PROJECT FILES.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for data from CSV/JSON files before using it in SQL queries.
    - Implementation of parameterized queries to prevent malicious SQL injection.
    - Security audits of data processing and database interaction code paths.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker has access to the Timesketch upload functionality (likely authenticated access, but in some configurations, unauthenticated upload might be possible).
    - The Timesketch application is vulnerable to SQL injection through CSV/JSON data processing.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code analysis is not possible with the provided PROJECT FILES, as they primarily consist of documentation, README files, and Docker configurations.
    - **Assumptions**:
        - The vulnerability likely resides in the Python backend code where CSV/JSON data is parsed and used to interact with the database (PostgreSQL in this case).
        - Without access to the backend code, the exact location and nature of the vulnerability cannot be determined.
        - It's assumed that the application might be constructing SQL queries dynamically using string concatenation or similar methods, making it susceptible to SQL injection if user-provided data is included without proper sanitization.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Precondition: Access to a running Timesketch instance and upload functionality. Assume attacker has user account with access to create a new sketch and upload data.
    2. Create a malicious CSV file (e.g., `malicious.csv`) with content designed to inject SQL code. Example:
       ```csv
       message,datetime,timestamp_desc,user_provided_field
       "Malicious event','; DROP TABLE users; --,2024-01-01T00:00:00,Test Event,Malicious Data
       ```
    3. Log in to the Timesketch instance as a user with upload privileges.
    4. Create a new sketch.
    5. Attempt to upload the `malicious.csv` file as a new timeline to the created sketch using the web UI or API client.
    6. Analyze the Timesketch application logs and database logs for any SQL errors or unusual database activity after the upload.
    7. Attempt to query the timeline and observe if there are any unexpected behaviors, errors, or signs of database manipulation (e.g., missing data, altered schema - which is less likely but possible in some scenarios).
    8. Monitor network traffic during and after the upload for any unusual data exfiltration attempts.
    9. If SQL errors are observed in the logs, or if there are signs of database manipulation, the vulnerability is confirmed.
