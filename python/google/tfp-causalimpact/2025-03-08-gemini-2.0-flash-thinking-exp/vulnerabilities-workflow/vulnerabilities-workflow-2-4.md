- Vulnerability Name: Uncontrolled Exposure of Backend Errors

- Description:
    1. An attacker provides a pandas DataFrame as input to the `fit_causalimpact` function.
    2. This DataFrame contains extreme numerical values, such as `inf` or `-inf`, in the outcome or covariate columns.
    3. The `_validate_data_and_columns` function in `causalimpact/data.py` does not explicitly reject `inf` values, as long as the dtype is numeric.
    4. When the data is processed by TensorFlow Probability, especially during model fitting in `_run_gibbs_sampler`, these extreme values can lead to numerical instability or errors in the TensorFlow backend (e.g., gradient explosion, NaN values during computation).
    5. These backend errors are not gracefully handled by the `fit_causalimpact` function, and the raw error messages from TensorFlow, which can include internal paths and potentially sensitive information about the model or computation environment, are propagated to the user.

- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: Exposure of internal TensorFlow error messages can reveal information about the library's internals, the computational environment, or potentially even code paths, which could be used by an attacker to gain a deeper understanding of the system for further attacks.
    - Reduced User Experience: Unhandled exceptions and raw error messages are confusing and detrimental to the user experience, especially for non-expert users who may not understand TensorFlow error messages.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project does not currently implement specific mitigations for handling backend errors caused by extreme numerical inputs and preventing the exposure of raw error messages.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement stricter input validation in `_validate_data_and_columns` or within `CausalImpactData` to explicitly check for and reject `inf` and potentially very large numerical values in the input DataFrame.
    - Error Handling: Wrap the TensorFlow Probability model fitting and inference steps in `_run_gibbs_sampler` within a `try-except` block to catch potential TensorFlow exceptions (e.g., `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`, `tf.errors.NumericalError`).
    - Graceful Error Reporting: In the `except` block, instead of propagating the raw TensorFlow exception, log the detailed error for debugging purposes and return a user-friendly error message indicating that the analysis failed due to numerical issues with the input data. This message should advise the user to check their input data for extreme or invalid numerical values.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide or influence the input data fed to the `fit_causalimpact` function. This is a typical scenario for external attackers interacting with a service that uses this library to analyze user-provided data.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/causalimpact/data.py`
    2. Function: `_validate_data_and_columns`
    3. Code Snippet:
       ```python
       def _validate_data_and_columns(data: pd.DataFrame,
                                       outcome_column: Optional[str]):
           ...
           if not data.dtypes.map(pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype).all():
               raise ValueError("Input data must contain only numeric values.")
           return data, outcome_column, feature_columns
       ```
       - The `is_numeric_dtype` check allows `inf` values as they are considered numeric.
       - There is no explicit check to reject `inf` or very large numbers in the outcome or feature columns within this function.
    4. File: `/code/causalimpact/causalimpact_lib.py`
    5. Function: `_run_gibbs_sampler`
    6. Code Description:
       - This function performs the core model fitting using TensorFlow Probability's Gibbs sampler.
       - It calls `gibbs_sampler.fit_with_gibbs_sampling` which executes TensorFlow operations.
       - If the input data contains extreme values, these operations may lead to TensorFlow exceptions due to numerical issues.
       - The `_run_gibbs_sampler` function and `fit_causalimpact` function do not have `try-except` blocks to handle potential TensorFlow exceptions.
       - As a result, raw TensorFlow error messages are propagated to the user if exceptions occur.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Python script to test the vulnerability.
    2. Import the `causalimpact` library, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
    3. Create a pandas DataFrame with a datetime index and two columns, 'y' and 'x1'.
    4. Populate the DataFrame with some numerical data.
    5. Introduce an `inf` value into the 'y' column at a specific index within the pre-period. For example:
       ```python
       import pandas as pd
       import numpy as np
       import causalimpact as ci

       date_index = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')
       data = pd.DataFrame({'y': np.random.randn(100), 'x1': np.random.randn(100)}, index=date_index)
       data['y'][10] = np.inf # Inject inf value in pre-period
       ```
    6. Define pre-period and post-period:
       ```python
       pre_period = (date_index[0], date_index[50])
       post_period = (date_index[51], date_index[-1])
       ```
    7. Call `ci.fit_causalimpact()` with the crafted DataFrame and periods:
       ```python
       try:
           impact = ci.fit_causalimpact(data, pre_period=pre_period, post_period=post_period)
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Caught Exception: {e}")
       ```
    8. Run the script.
    9. Observe the output. Verify that the output contains a TensorFlow error message, which confirms the uncontrolled exposure of backend errors. The output will likely show a traceback including TensorFlow error details instead of a user-friendly error message from `causalimpact`.
