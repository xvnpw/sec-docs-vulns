### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability name: Potential JPEG processing vulnerability in `tf.io.decode_jpeg`
  - Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JPEG file designed to exploit a vulnerability in TensorFlow's JPEG decoding functionality (`tf.io.decode_jpeg`).
    2. The attacker prepares a custom video dataset for finetuning, as described in the project documentation, and replaces one or more RGB frames within the video with the malicious JPEG file.
    3. The attacker initiates the finetuning process using the provided scripts (e.g., `scripts/train-real.sh` or `scripts/train-synth.sh`) and specifies the custom video dataset directory as input.
    4. During data loading in `src/dataset.py`, the `read_crop_im` function is called to process each frame of the video.
    5. Within `read_crop_im`, the `tf.io.decode_jpeg` function attempts to decode the malicious JPEG file.
    6. If TensorFlow's JPEG decoding is vulnerable to the crafted file, this could lead to a crash, unexpected behavior, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the server running the application.
  - Impact: High. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions. The impact severity depends on the specific vulnerability in `tf.io.decode_jpeg`.
  - Vulnerability rank: High
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly uses `tf.io.decode_jpeg` without any input validation or sanitization to prevent processing of malicious files.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement checks to validate and sanitize user-provided JPEG files before passing them to `tf.io.decode_jpeg`. This could include verifying file headers, checking for unusual file sizes or structures, or using dedicated security scanning tools on uploaded files.
    - Using a safer image decoding library: Explore alternative JPEG decoding libraries that are known to be more robust against vulnerabilities, if a suitable and performant alternative exists within the TensorFlow ecosystem or can be integrated without significant overhead.
    - Sandboxing: Isolate the image processing operations within a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited. This could involve using containerization or other isolation techniques.
  - Preconditions:
    1. The application is running in finetuning mode, allowing users to provide custom video data.
    2. The attacker has the ability to prepare and supply a custom video dataset containing a malicious JPEG file.
    3. The version of TensorFlow being used is vulnerable to the specific exploit embedded in the crafted JPEG file.
  - Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/dataset.py`
    2. Function: `read_crop_im(im, im_width, im_height, channels=3, order='CHW', crop=None)`
    3. Line: `im = tf.io.decode_jpeg(im, channels=channels)`
       - This line is responsible for decoding JPEG image data using TensorFlow's built-in function.
       - The input `im` comes directly from user-supplied video files during finetuning.
       - If a malicious JPEG is provided as `im`, and a vulnerability exists in `tf.io.decode_jpeg`, it can be triggered at this point.
       - No error handling or input validation is performed before calling `tf.io.decode_jpeg`.
  - Security test case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious JPEG file:** Utilize publicly available resources or tools (e.g., Metasploit, online exploit generators, or adapt existing public exploits for JPEG vulnerabilities like libjpeg vulnerabilities) to create a JPEG file specifically designed to exploit a known vulnerability in JPEG decoding libraries, ideally targeting vulnerabilities known to affect TensorFlow's `tf.io.decode_jpeg` or similar underlying libraries.
    2. **Create a malicious video dataset:** Follow the instructions in the project's README.md for preparing a custom video dataset for finetuning. In the `<my_video>/rgb/*.png` directory, replace one or more of the PNG image files with the maliciously crafted JPEG file created in the previous step. Rename the malicious JPEG file to have a `.png` extension to maintain consistency with expected file types, if necessary.
    3. **Run finetuning with the malicious dataset:** Execute the finetuning script (e.g., `./scripts/train-real.sh` or `scripts/train-synth.sh`). Modify the script or configuration files to point the `--config.datadir` flag to the directory containing the malicious video dataset prepared in step 2.
    4. **Monitor for exploitation:** Run the finetuning process and closely monitor the application's behavior. Look for signs of crashes, unexpected errors in the logs, or unusual system behavior that could indicate successful exploitation of the JPEG vulnerability. Specifically, monitor the process for segmentation faults, Python exceptions related to image processing, or any other anomalies during the data loading and processing phase.
    5. **Verify vulnerability:** If a crash or unexpected behavior occurs, investigate the logs and error messages to confirm that the issue originates from the `tf.io.decode_jpeg` function or the TensorFlow image processing pipeline when handling the malicious JPEG file. Further analysis might involve debugging the TensorFlow code or examining system logs to pinpoint the root cause and confirm the vulnerability. If successful exploitation is confirmed, assess the potential for arbitrary code execution based on the nature of the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Image processing vulnerability in `PIL.Image.open`
  - Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, GIF, or other formats supported by Pillow) specifically designed to exploit a vulnerability in Pillow's image processing capabilities, particularly within the `PIL.Image.open` function.
    2. The attacker prepares a custom video dataset for finetuning. Following the project's documentation, the attacker replaces either the background image (`<my_video>/bg_est.png`) or one of the object mask images (`<my_video>/mask/01/*.png`, etc.) with the malicious image file.
    3. Alternatively, for evaluation, the attacker could replace the background image `data/kubric-shadows-v1-2obj-test/1/bg_128.png` or similar background or mask images used in evaluation datasets with the malicious image.
    4. The attacker initiates either the finetuning process (using scripts like `scripts/train-real.sh`) or the evaluation process (using `scripts/eval.sh` or `eval.py`), ensuring that the malicious image will be processed.
    5. During data loading, when processing background or mask images, the `read_image` function in `src/utils.py` is called.
    6. Inside `read_image`, `PIL.Image.open(filepath).convert(pil_format)` is executed on the attacker-controlled image file path.
    7. If Pillow is vulnerable to the crafted image, exploiting a flaw in `PIL.Image.open` or subsequent image processing steps, this could lead to a crash, denial of service, or, more critically, arbitrary code execution on the server.
  - Impact: High. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the server, steal data, or disrupt operations. The exact impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability within Pillow.
  - Vulnerability rank: High
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly employs `PIL.Image.open` without any form of input validation, sanitization, or security checks to mitigate the risk of processing malicious image files.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust checks to validate and sanitize all user-provided image files before they are processed by `PIL.Image.open`. This should include verifying file formats, checking for corrupted headers, and potentially using security scanning tools to detect known malicious patterns within the image files.
    - Secure Image Processing Library: Investigate and consider migrating to image processing libraries known for better security records and robustness against common image-based exploits, if viable alternatives exist that meet the project's requirements for performance and functionality.
    - Sandboxing Image Processing: Encapsulate the image processing operations, especially those involving `PIL.Image.open`, within a secure sandbox environment. This would restrict the potential damage an attacker could inflict even if a Pillow vulnerability is successfully exploited, limiting access to system resources and sensitive data.
  - Preconditions:
    1. The application must be running in a mode that processes user-supplied image files, such as finetuning or evaluation with custom datasets.
    2. The attacker must be able to provide a maliciously crafted image file, either as a background image or a mask image within the custom video dataset.
    3. The version of Pillow (PIL) used by the application must be susceptible to the specific vulnerability targeted by the crafted image file.
  - Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/utils.py`
    2. Function: `read_image(filepath, width=None, height=None, pil_format='RGB')`
    3. Line: `im = Image.open(filepath).convert(pil_format)`
       - This line utilizes `PIL.Image.open` to open and load an image from the file path provided as `filepath`.
       - The `filepath` variable is directly derived from user-provided data directories for background images (`bg_est.png`, `bg_128.png`) and mask images (`*.png` in mask directories).
       - If a malicious image file path is provided, `PIL.Image.open` could be exploited if a vulnerability exists in Pillow's handling of that specific image format or file content.
       - No input validation or error handling specifically designed to prevent malicious image processing is present before this line of code.
  - Security test case:
    1. **Craft a Malicious Image File:** Using publicly available resources, exploit development tools, or by adapting existing public exploits for Pillow vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerabilities related to PNG, GIF, or other formats), create a malicious image file. Choose a format and exploit that targets `PIL.Image.open`.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Dataset:**
        - **For Finetuning:** Create a custom video dataset directory as per the project's documentation. Replace either the background image file (`<my_video>/bg_est.png`) or one of the mask image files (e.g., in `<my_video>/mask/01/*.png`) with the malicious image file created in step 1. Keep the filename consistent with what the application expects (e.g., `bg_est.png` or `0001.png`).
        - **For Evaluation:** Identify the evaluation dataset directory (e.g., `data/kubric-shadows-v1-2obj-test/1/`). Replace the background image file (e.g., `bg_128.png`) or mask images within this directory with the malicious image file.
    3. **Execute Finetuning or Evaluation:**
        - **Finetuning:** Run the finetuning script (e.g., `./scripts/train-real.sh`) and point the `--config.datadir` flag to the malicious custom video dataset directory.
        - **Evaluation:** Run the evaluation script (`./scripts/eval.sh` or `eval.py`) with the `--datadir` flag pointing to the modified evaluation dataset directory. If using `eval.py` directly, also specify the `--resdir` and `--save_json_path` as needed.
    4. **Monitor for Exploitation:** Execute the chosen script and monitor the application for signs of successful exploitation. Look for crashes, error messages, or unexpected behavior during the image loading or processing stages. Pay close attention to any segmentation faults, Python exceptions related to PIL/Pillow, or unusual system resource usage.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability:** If you observe a crash or unexpected behavior, examine the application logs and system logs to confirm that the issue is triggered by `PIL.Image.open` when processing the malicious image. Debugging or further analysis might be necessary to precisely pinpoint the vulnerability and assess the potential for code execution. If exploitation is confirmed, evaluate the severity and potential for further malicious activities based on the nature of the Pillow vulnerability.
