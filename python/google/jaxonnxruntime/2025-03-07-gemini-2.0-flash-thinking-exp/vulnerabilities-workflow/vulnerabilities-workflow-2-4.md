- **Vulnerability Name:** Uncontrolled Shape/Dimension Parameter in ONNX Operator Implementation
- **Description:** The `op_code_generator.py` script automatically generates template code for new ONNX operators. This template, particularly in the `onnx_{op_name_lower}` function, uses `*input_args` without specific type or shape validation. If a newly implemented operator relies on shape information from the ONNX model (e.g., for reshaping, slicing, or indexing operations) and does not validate the shape parameters, a maliciously crafted ONNX model could provide unexpected or malicious shape values. This could lead to out-of-bounds access, buffer overflows, or other memory corruption issues when the generated JAX code is executed.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution. By crafting a malicious ONNX model with manipulated shape parameters, an attacker could potentially cause the JAX runtime to access memory outside of the intended buffers, leading to crashes, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution if memory corruption vulnerabilities are exploited.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The generated code template includes a `TODO` comment to add implementation, but does not guide developers to include input validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation within each ONNX operator implementation, especially for shape-related parameters.
    - Clear guidelines and documentation for developers on secure operator implementation, emphasizing input validation and sanitization in `contributing.md` and `docs/adding_a_new_op.rst`.
    - Static analysis tools or linters to automatically detect missing input validations in operator implementations.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to create a malicious ONNX model.
    - The malicious model must target a newly implemented ONNX operator or an existing operator that lacks proper input validation for shape parameters.
    - The user must convert and run this malicious ONNX model using `jaxonnxruntime`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/tools/op_code_generator.py`
    - **Function:** `main(args)`
    - **Template Code:**
      ```python
      template_tail = """
      @functools.partial(jax.jit, static_argnames=())
      def onnx_{op_name_lower}(*input_args):
        \"\"\"https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/v1.12.0/docs/Operators.md#{op_name} for more details.\"\"\"
        # TODO({username}): add the implementation here.
        return input_args
      """
      ```
    - **Analysis:** The `op_code_generator.py` tool creates a template Python file for implementing new ONNX operators. The generated `onnx_{op_name_lower}` function takes `*input_args` without any specific type or shape checking. The `TODO` comment encourages developers to add implementation logic, but lacks guidance on security best practices such as input validation. If a developer implements an operator using this template and relies on shape information from the ONNX model without validation, it becomes vulnerable to malicious shape parameters. For example, if an operator uses a shape parameter from `input_args` to index into an array, a large or negative value in the malicious model could lead to out-of-bounds access when the JAX code is executed.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        - Assume an attacker can create a malicious ONNX model.
        - Assume a developer has implemented a new ONNX operator, for instance, `MyCustomOp`, using the template generated by `op_code_generator.py`, and this operator uses a shape parameter from the ONNX model to perform slicing without input validation.
    2.  **Craft Malicious ONNX Model:**
        - The attacker crafts an ONNX model that includes the `MyCustomOp` operator.
        - Within this model, the attacker manipulates the shape parameter associated with `MyCustomOp` to an extreme value (e.g., a very large number or a negative number).
    3.  **User Conversion and Execution:**
        - The user is tricked into using `jaxonnxruntime` to convert and run this malicious ONNX model.
        - The conversion process proceeds as usual as there's no validation during ONNX parsing itself.
    4.  **Exploit Trigger:**
        - When `jaxonnxruntime` executes the converted model, it calls the `onnx_mycustomop` function.
        - Due to the lack of input validation in `onnx_mycustomop`, the malicious shape parameter is used directly in slicing or indexing operations.
    5.  **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - Observe the execution. If the manipulated shape parameter causes a crash (e.g., `IndexError`, `Segmentation Fault`) or unexpected behavior (e.g., incorrect output due to out-of-bounds memory access), it indicates a successful exploit.
    6.  **Expected Outcome:** The test should demonstrate that by providing a maliciously crafted ONNX model with manipulated shape parameters, it's possible to trigger a vulnerability in the JAX execution due to missing input validation in the custom operator implementation. The vulnerability could range from crashing the application to potential arbitrary code execution depending on the specific operator and the nature of memory corruption.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Arbitrary File Overwrite via Zip Extraction
- **Description:** The `extract` function in `/code/jaxonnxruntime/experimental/export/exportable_utils.py` and `/code/jaxonnxruntime/core/onnx_utils_test.py` extracts zip files without proper path sanitization. If a malicious zip file is crafted to contain filenames with path traversal characters (e.g., `../../`), the extracted files could be written outside the intended extraction directory, potentially overwriting system files or other sensitive data. While this function might be used internally or in test cases, if it's ever exposed to processing user-provided zip files (e.g., ONNX models distributed as zip archives), it could become a vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary File Overwrite. An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the system where the `jaxonnxruntime` library is used, leading to potential system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The `extract` function directly uses `zipfile.ZipFile.extractall` without any path sanitization or checks.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Path sanitization within the `extract` function to validate and sanitize filenames before extraction, ensuring they remain within the intended extraction directory.
    - Principle of least privilege: ensure the process running the extraction has minimal permissions to reduce the impact of a successful file overwrite.
    - Documentation warning against using `extract` with untrusted zip files.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to create a malicious zip file containing filenames with path traversal sequences.
    - The `extract` function must be used to extract this malicious zip file. This could occur if:
        - Users are instructed to extract ONNX models from zip files using this function.
        - The function is used internally to process user-provided ONNX models packaged as zip files.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/jaxonnxruntime/experimental/export/exportable_utils.py` and `/code/jaxonnxruntime/core/onnx_utils_test.py` (and likely other locations where `extract` is used).
    - **Function:** `extract(filename, folder=None)`
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```python
      def extract(filename, folder=None):
          base_dir = os.path.dirname(filename)
          _, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
          assert ext in ('.zip', '.tar', '.gz'), 'Only support zip/tar files.'
          if ext == '.zip':
              fp = zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r')
          else:
              fp = tarfile.open(filename, 'r')
          if folder is None:
              folder = base_dir
          fp.extractall(folder) # Vulnerable line
      ```
    - **Analysis:** The `extractall(folder)` method of `zipfile.ZipFile` is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. If a zip file contains entries with filenames like `../../sensitive_file.txt`, `extractall` will attempt to write this file to the directory `folder/../../sensitive_file.txt`, which resolves to a location outside of the intended `folder`. This allows an attacker to potentially overwrite arbitrary files.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        - Create a temporary directory for testing.
    2.  **Craft Malicious Zip File:**
        - Create a zip file (`malicious.zip`) containing a file with a path traversal filename, e.g., `../../pwned.txt`. The content of `pwned.txt` can be arbitrary (e.g., "You have been PWNED!").
    3.  **Extraction using Vulnerable Function:**
        - Use the `extract` function from `jaxonnxruntime` to extract `malicious.zip` into the temporary directory.
    4.  **Verify File Overwrite:**
        - After extraction, check if the file `pwned.txt` has been created outside the temporary directory (e.g., in the parent directory or system root, depending on the path traversal).
        - Verify the content of the overwritten file (if successful) to ensure it matches the content from the malicious zip file.
    5.  **Expected Outcome:** The test should demonstrate that `pwned.txt` is created outside the intended temporary directory, proving the arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability. If a sensitive system file was targeted instead of `pwned.txt`, it could lead to a more severe impact.
