- Vulnerability Name: Basic Audio Announcement Subgroup Metadata Parsing Vulnerability

- Description:
    The `auracast.py` application parses the Basic Audio Announcement (BAA) within Bluetooth advertisements to discover and process Auracast broadcasts. The `BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` method, used in `BroadcastScanner.on_periodic_advertisement()` and `BroadcastScanner.on_new_broadcast()`, parses the BAA data.  Within the BAA, subgroups contain metadata which is also parsed from bytes. A vulnerability exists if the parsing logic for subgroup metadata within `BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` does not correctly handle maliciously crafted metadata lengths, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read or write when accessing or processing the metadata bytes. Specifically, if the metadata length field in the Basic Audio Announcement is larger than the actual data provided in the packet, the `from_bytes()` method might attempt to read beyond the bounds of the received data buffer when processing subgroup metadata.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Bluetooth advertisement containing a Basic Audio Announcement.
    2. Within the Basic Audio Announcement, the attacker constructs a subgroup with a metadata length field that specifies a length greater than the actual metadata bytes provided in the advertisement.
    3. The Bumble library, running the `auracast.py` application, scans for Bluetooth advertisements and receives the malicious advertisement.
    4. The `BroadcastScanner.on_periodic_advertisement()` or `BroadcastScanner.on_new_broadcast()` function in `auracast.py` is triggered upon receiving the advertisement.
    5. The `BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` method is called to parse the BAA data from the advertisement.
    6. During the parsing of subgroups within `BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()`, the crafted metadata length field is read.
    7. The parsing logic uses this inflated metadata length to attempt to read metadata bytes.
    8. Due to insufficient bounds checking, the read operation may go out of bounds of the received advertisement data buffer.

- Impact:
    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability could lead to information disclosure, where an attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the device's memory beyond the intended advertisement data. In more severe scenarios, depending on how the out-of-bounds read is handled and the memory layout, it could potentially lead to a crash or unexpected behavior. While less likely with Python, in other languages, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be leveraged for more serious exploits.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    There are no explicit mitigations in the provided `auracast.py` code to handle malformed metadata lengths in Basic Audio Announcements. The code relies on the `bap.BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` method, and if this method is vulnerable, `auracast.py` will inherit the vulnerability.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation and bounds checking are missing in the `bap.BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` method when parsing subgroup metadata length and subsequently reading the metadata bytes. Specifically, before reading the metadata based on the indicated length, the code should verify that the length does not exceed the remaining buffer size of the advertisement data.

- Preconditions:
    1. A vulnerable Bumble-based application, such as `auracast.py`, is running and scanning for Bluetooth advertisements.
    2. An attacker is within Bluetooth range and can transmit crafted Bluetooth advertisements.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/apps/auracast.py`
    2. **Function:** `BroadcastScanner.on_periodic_advertisement()` and `BroadcastScanner.on_new_broadcast()`
    3. **Vulnerable Code Path:**
        - Advertisements are received and processed by `BroadcastScanner.on_advertisement()`.
        - If the advertisement contains `gatt.GATT_BASIC_AUDIO_ANNOUNCEMENT_SERVICE` service data, `BroadcastScanner.on_periodic_advertisement()` or `BroadcastScanner.on_new_broadcast()` is called.
        - Inside these functions, `bap.BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes(data)` is called to parse the service data.
        - The vulnerability lies within the implementation of `bap.BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()` and how it handles subgroup metadata length and parsing.
    4. **Hypothetical Vulnerable Code in `bap/basic_audio_announcement.py` (or similar, file not provided but assumed location based on usage):**
       ```python
       class BasicAudioAnnouncement:
           # ...
           @staticmethod
           def from_bytes(data: bytes) -> BasicAudioAnnouncement:
               # ...
               subgroups = []
               offset = ... # Offset after parsing other BAA fields
               while offset < len(data):
                   subgroup_length = data[offset] # Read subgroup length
                   offset += 1
                   subgroup_data = data[offset:offset+subgroup_length] # Read subgroup data
                   offset += subgroup_length
                   # ... inside subgroup_data parsing ...
                   metadata_length = subgroup_data[metadata_length_offset] # Read metadata length from subgroup
                   metadata = subgroup_data[metadata_offset:metadata_offset+metadata_length] # Read metadata based on length
                   # Potential vulnerability: If metadata_length is maliciously large, this read could go out of bounds of subgroup_data or even the original 'data' buffer if not carefully implemented in 'from_bytes'
                   subgroups.append(Subgroup.from_bytes(subgroup_data)) # Actual implementation might be different but concept is same
               # ...
               return BasicAudioAnnouncement(...)
       ```

    ----------------------------------------------------
    | ... Other Fields ... | BAA Service Data | ...   |
    ----------------------------------------------------
                           ^ Service Data starts here

    | ... BAA Header ... | Subgroup 1 | Subgroup 2 | ...          |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ^ Subgroup 1 starts

    Subgroup Data (bytes) - Parsed within BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes() for each subgroup
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    | ... Subgroup Header ... | Metadata Length (maliciously large) | Metadata Bytes (shorter than indicated length) | ... |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
                               ^ Metadata Length field
                                                                  ^ Read attempts to go beyond actual data
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Prepare a Bumble test environment capable of running `auracast.py`.
        - Set up a Bluetooth device (e.g., another Bumble instance or a Bluetooth sniffer/transmitter) to act as a malicious broadcaster.
    2. **Craft Malicious Advertisement:**
        - Construct a Bluetooth advertisement payload.
        - Include Service Data with UUID `gatt.GATT_BASIC_AUDIO_ANNOUNCEMENT_SERVICE`.
        - Within the Service Data, create a Basic Audio Announcement structure.
        - Inside the BAA, create a subgroup.
        - In the subgroup's metadata section, set the metadata length field to a value larger than the actual number of metadata bytes that will follow in the advertisement. For example, indicate a metadata length of 20 bytes but only include 5 metadata bytes.
    3. **Run Test:**
        - Start the `auracast.py` application in scanning mode, targeting broadcasts.
        - Transmit the crafted malicious advertisement using the Bluetooth transmitter.
        - Monitor the `auracast.py` application's behavior.
    4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - Check for error messages, crashes, or unexpected behavior in the `auracast.py` application logs or output.
        - Ideally, use a debugger or memory safety tools (if available for Python extensions used for Bluetooth parsing in Bumble) to confirm an out-of-bounds read attempt when parsing the subgroup metadata in `BasicAudioAnnouncement.from_bytes()`.
        - A successful test would demonstrate that the application attempts to read beyond the bounds of the provided advertisement data when parsing the malicious BAA metadata length.
