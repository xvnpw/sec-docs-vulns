### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Malicious Model Loading via Unvalidated Path

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker can trick a user into modifying the `.env` file or command line arguments, specifically changing the `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` or `TF_MODEL_URI` to point to a malicious model.
    2. When the user executes the pipeline using commands like `make run-df-gpu` or `make run-direct`, the `run.py` script reads the configuration, including the attacker-controlled model path, from the `.env` file or command line arguments.
    3. The `run.py` script instantiates `ModelConfig` with the provided path and passes this configuration to the `build_pipeline` function in `pipeline.py`.
    4. In `pipeline.py`, the `build_pipeline` function uses the `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` to initialize either `PytorchModelHandlerTensor` or `TFModelHandlerTensor`. Similarly, `TF_MODEL_URI` is used for `TFModelHandlerTensor`.
    5. The `PytorchModelHandlerTensor` or `TFModelHandlerTensor` directly loads the model from the attacker-specified path without any validation or sanitization.
    6. Consequently, when the Dataflow pipeline executes the `RunInference` transform, it loads and uses the malicious model provided by the attacker, leading to the execution of unintended or harmful inference tasks.

* **Impact:**
    - **Code Execution:** A malicious model could be crafted to execute arbitrary code within the Dataflow worker environment during the inference process.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** The malicious model could be designed to intercept and exfiltrate sensitive input data, intermediate processing results, or even credentials to an attacker-controlled external server.
    - **Model Poisoning:** If the pipeline is part of a larger machine learning workflow that includes model retraining or fine-tuning, using a malicious model could poison the subsequent iterations, leading to compromised models in the future.
    - **Incorrect Predictions:** Even without malicious code execution, a subtly manipulated model could produce incorrect or biased predictions, leading to errors in downstream applications or business logic that rely on the pipeline's output.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project currently lacks any input validation or sanitization for the `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` and `TF_MODEL_URI` configurations. The paths are directly used to load models.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation for `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` and `TF_MODEL_URI` to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., GCS paths, TF Hub URIs) and potentially sanitize them to prevent path traversal attacks.
    - **Path Whitelisting or Allowed Repositories:** Define a whitelist of allowed GCS paths or trusted model repositories (e.g., TF Hub official models) from which models can be loaded. This would restrict the pipeline to using only verified and safe models.
    - **Code Review and Security Auditing:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits, especially focusing on the configuration parsing and model loading sections of the code, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the service account used by the Dataflow pipeline has the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject a malicious model.
    - **Documentation and User Warnings:** Clearly document the security implications of modifying the `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` and `TF_MODEL_URI` configurations and warn users against using untrusted model sources.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the configuration of the Dataflow pipeline. This could be achieved by:
        - **Direct Access:** If the attacker has direct access to the environment where the pipeline is configured and run (e.g., developer machine, CI/CD pipeline configuration).
        - **Social Engineering:** Tricking a user with access to the configuration into modifying the `.env` file or command line arguments to point to a malicious model path.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`my_project/run.py`**:
        - The `parse_known_args` function uses `argparse` to define and parse command-line arguments:
            ```python
            parser.add_argument(
                "--model_state_dict_path", dest="model_state_dict_path", required=False, help="Path to the model's state_dict."
            )
            parser.add_argument(
                "--tf_model_uri", dest="tf_model_uri", required=False, help="tfhub model URI from https://tfhub.dev/"
            )
            ```
        - The parsed arguments, including `known_args.model_state_dict_path` and `known_args.tf_model_uri`, are directly used to instantiate the `ModelConfig` object:
            ```python
            model_config = ModelConfig(
                model_state_dict_path=known_args.model_state_dict_path,
                model_class_name=known_args.model_name,
                model_params={"num_classes": 1000},
                tf_model_uri=known_args.tf_model_uri,
                device=known_args.device,
            )
            ```
        - No validation or sanitization is performed on `known_args.model_state_dict_path` or `known_args.tf_model_uri` before creating `ModelConfig`.

    2. **`my_project/config.py`**:
        - The `ModelConfig` class uses `pydantic` to define the configuration schema:
            ```python
            class ModelConfig(BaseModel):
                model_state_dict_path: str = Field(None, description="path that contains the torch model state directory")
                tf_model_uri: str = Field(None, description="TF model uri from https://tfhub.dev/")
                # ... other fields ...

                @root_validator
                def validate_fields(cls, values):
                    # ... validation logic (mutual exclusion, required fields) ...
                    return values
            ```
        - The `ModelConfig` definition includes `model_state_dict_path` and `tf_model_uri` as string fields.
        - The `@root_validator` `validate_fields` method performs checks to ensure that either `model_state_dict_path` or `tf_model_uri` is specified, and if `model_state_dict_path` is used, `model_class_name` and `model_params` are also provided.
        - **Crucially, there is no validation on the *content* or *source* of `model_state_dict_path` or `tf_model_uri`.** It is assumed that the provided paths are valid and safe, which is not a secure assumption.

    3. **`my_project/pipeline.py`**:
        - In the `build_pipeline` function, the `ModelConfig` is used to create either `PytorchModelHandlerTensor` or `TFModelHandlerTensor`:
            ```python
            if model_config.model_state_dict_path:
                model_handler = KeyedModelHandler(
                    PytorchModelHandlerTensor(
                        state_dict_path=model_config.model_state_dict_path,
                        # ... other parameters ...
                    )
                )
            elif model_config.tf_model_uri:
                model_handler = KeyedModelHandler(
                    TFModelHandlerTensor(
                        model_uri=model_config.tf_model_uri,
                        # ... other parameters ...
                    )
                )
            ```
        - The `model_config.model_state_dict_path` and `model_config.tf_model_uri` values, directly obtained from user configuration, are passed as `state_dict_path` and `model_uri` respectively to the model handler constructors.
        - The `PytorchModelHandlerTensor` and `TFModelHandlerTensor` classes within the Apache Beam ML library are responsible for loading the models from these paths. **If a malicious path is provided, these handlers will attempt to load and use the model from that path without further checks within this project's code.**

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Model:**
        - Create a Python file named `malicious_model.py` with the following content:
            ```python
            import torch.nn as nn
            import torch

            class MaliciousModel(nn.Module):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
                    print("Malicious model loaded and executed!")
                    # Simulate malicious activity - e.g., attempt to access environment variables
                    import os
                    print(f"Environment variables: {os.environ}")

                def forward(self, input_tensor):
                    # Dummy forward pass
                    return torch.zeros_like(input_tensor)
            ```
        - Create a script `create_malicious_model_state_dict.py` to generate a state dictionary for this model:
            ```python
            import torch
            from malicious_model import MaliciousModel

            model = MaliciousModel(num_classes=10) # num_classes is just an example parameter
            torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'malicious_model.pth')
            ```
        - Run `python create_malicious_model_state_dict.py` to create `malicious_model.pth` in your local directory.
        - Upload `malicious_model.pth` to a publicly accessible Google Cloud Storage bucket. For example, if your bucket is named `attacker-bucket` and you upload the file to the root, the GCS path will be `gs://attacker-bucket/malicious_model.pth`.

    2. **Modify Project Configuration:**
        - Edit the `.env` file in the project directory.
        - Change the line `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH="gs://apache-beam-ml/models/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2.pth"` to `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH="gs://attacker-bucket/malicious_model.pth"`.
        - Ensure `MODEL_NAME` is set to a valid model name like `mobilenet_v2` (it doesn't strictly matter for this test as the malicious model loading is the focus).

    3. **Run the Pipeline Locally:**
        - Execute the command `make run-direct` from the project's root directory.

    4. **Observe the Output and Logs:**
        - Examine the console output and any logs generated by the `make run-direct` command.
        - **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmed):** You should see the message "Malicious model loaded and executed!" printed in the output or logs. This confirms that the pipeline loaded and executed the `MaliciousModel` class from the attacker-controlled path. You might also see the environment variables printed if the malicious code successfully accessed them.
        - **If the vulnerability is mitigated:** You should *not* see the "Malicious model loaded and executed!" message, and the pipeline should ideally either fail to load the model or load a safe, expected model.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating the `MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH` configuration, an attacker can indeed cause the pipeline to load and execute code from a model they control, confirming the vulnerability.
