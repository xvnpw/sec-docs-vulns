### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Output Data Path Configuration
- Description:
    1. The user clones the repository and copies `.env.template` to `.env`.
    2. The user edits the `.env` file to configure the pipeline, including setting the `OUTPUT_DATA` variable.
    3. The user, either unknowingly or intentionally, sets `OUTPUT_DATA` to a Google Cloud Storage bucket that is publicly accessible or controlled by a malicious actor.
    4. The user runs the machine learning pipeline using `make run-df-cpu`, `make run-df-gpu`, or `make run-df-gpu-flex`.
    5. The pipeline executes and writes the machine learning model's prediction results to the GCS path specified in `OUTPUT_DATA`.
    6. If `OUTPUT_DATA` points to a publicly accessible bucket, anyone with the bucket URL can access the prediction results. If `OUTPUT_DATA` points to an attacker-controlled bucket, the attacker gains access to the prediction results.
- Impact: Exposure of sensitive machine learning model prediction results to unauthorized parties. This could include confidential business data, personal information inferred from images, or insights into the model's behavior.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Add a warning in the `README.md` and `.env.template` files about the security implications of setting `OUTPUT_DATA` to a public or untrusted location. Emphasize the importance of using private GCS buckets and properly configuring access controls.
    - Recommend in the documentation to follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles for the service account running the Dataflow job, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access the output bucket after pipeline execution.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must clone the repository and configure the `.env` file.
    - The user must misconfigure the `OUTPUT_DATA` variable in the `.env` file to point to a publicly accessible or attacker-controlled GCS bucket.
    - The user must successfully run the pipeline using `make run-df-cpu`, `make run-df-gpu`, or `make run-df-gpu-flex`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `my_project/run.py`: The `run` function uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `--output`, which is used to specify the output data path.
    ```python
    parser.add_argument(
        "--output", dest="output", required=True, help="Path where to save output predictions." " text file."
    )
    ```
    2. The parsed argument `known_args.output` is then used to instantiate `SinkConfig`.
    ```python
    sink_config = SinkConfig(output=known_args.output)
    ```
    3. `my_project/config.py`: The `SinkConfig` class is defined using Pydantic, where `output` is a field that takes the output path string.
    ```python
    class SinkConfig(BaseModel):
        output: str = Field(..., description="the output path to save results as a text file")
    ```
    4. `my_project/pipeline.py`: In the `build_pipeline` function, the `sink_config.output` is directly passed to `beam.io.WriteToText` or `beam.io.fileio.WriteToFiles` as the output path.
    ```python
    predictions | "WriteOutputToGCS" >> beam.io.WriteToText(  # pylint: disable=expression-not-assigned
        sink_config.output, shard_name_template="", append_trailing_newlines=True
    )
    ```
    or for streaming pipeline:
    ```python
    (
        predictions
        | "WriteOutputToGCS"
        >> beam.io.fileio.WriteToFiles(sink_config.output, shards=0)  # pylint: disable=expression-not-assigned
    )
    ```
    5. `beam.io.WriteToText` and `beam.io.fileio.WriteToFiles` will write data to the specified GCS path without any validation of the bucket's access permissions within the pipeline code. The security depends entirely on the user's configuration of the GCS bucket's IAM policies, which is outside the scope of this project.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**: The attacker creates a publicly accessible Google Cloud Storage bucket, for example, `gs://attacker-public-bucket/`.
    2. **Victim Setup**: The victim clones the `dataflow-ml-starter` repository and configures the `.env` file, specifically setting `OUTPUT_DATA=gs://attacker-public-bucket/ml-output/`.
    3. **Victim Execution**: The victim executes the Dataflow pipeline using the command `make run-df-cpu`.
    4. **Data Output**: The Dataflow pipeline runs and writes the prediction results to the path specified in `OUTPUT_DATA`, which is `gs://attacker-public-bucket/ml-output/result_cpu_xqhu.txt`.
    5. **Attacker Access**: The attacker, since they control `gs://attacker-public-bucket/`, can access the `ml-output/result_cpu_xqhu.txt` file and retrieve the prediction results of the victim's machine learning pipeline. This demonstrates that a misconfiguration of `OUTPUT_DATA` can lead to unauthorized data access.
