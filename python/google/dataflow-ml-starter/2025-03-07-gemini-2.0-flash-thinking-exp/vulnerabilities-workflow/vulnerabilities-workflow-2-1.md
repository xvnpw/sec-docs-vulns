### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Unvalidated GCS Input Path

- **Description:**
    1. The `input` parameter, which specifies the GCS path to the text file containing image paths, is read directly from user-provided command-line arguments in `my_project/run.py`.
    2. This input path is then passed to the `SourceConfig` in `my_project/config.py` without any validation or sanitization to ensure it is a safe or expected GCS path.
    3. Subsequently, in `my_project/pipeline.py`, this unvalidated `source_config.input` is directly used by `beam.io.ReadFromText` to read the list of image paths.
    4. An attacker could provide a malicious GCS path as the `--input` argument, potentially leading to the pipeline attempting to read files from unexpected or unauthorized locations within GCS, if proper GCS permissions are not in place.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: If GCS permissions are misconfigured, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from GCS that the Dataflow job's service account has access to, even if those files are not intended to be processed by the pipeline. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data if such files exist in accessible GCS locations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not implement any input validation or sanitization for the GCS input path.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation should be implemented in `my_project/config.py` within the `SourceConfig` model to validate the `input` path. This validation should ensure that the path adheres to expected formats for GCS paths and potentially restrict access to specific allowed GCS buckets or paths.
    - Consider using more restrictive GCS permissions for the Dataflow job's service account to limit the scope of potential information disclosure even if input validation is bypassed.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to specify the `--input` parameter when running the Dataflow pipeline. This is typically possible for users who can launch Dataflow jobs using this project.
    - The Dataflow job's service account must have broader GCS read permissions than intended, allowing it to access files outside of the expected input data locations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `my_project/config.py`:
        ```python
        class SourceConfig(BaseModel):
            input: str = Field(..., description="the input path to a text file or a Pub/Sub topic")
            ...
        ```
        - The `SourceConfig` model defines the `input` field as a string but lacks any validators to check if it's a valid or safe GCS path.

    - `my_project/run.py`:
        ```python
        def parse_known_args(argv):
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument("--input", dest="input", required=True, help="Path to the text file containing image names.")
            ...
            return parser.parse_known_args(argv)

        def run(argv=None, save_main_session=True, test_pipeline=None) -> PipelineResult:
            ...
            known_args, pipeline_args = parse_known_args(argv)
            source_config = SourceConfig(input=known_args.input)
            ...
        ```
        - The `run.py` script parses the `--input` argument and directly assigns it to `SourceConfig.input` without validation.

    - `my_project/pipeline.py`:
        ```python
        def build_pipeline(pipeline, source_config: SourceConfig, sink_config: SinkConfig, model_config: ModelConfig) -> None:
            ...
            filename_value_pair = (
                pipeline
                | "ReadImageNames" >> beam.io.ReadFromText(source_config.input)
                ...
            )
            ...
        ```
        - The `build_pipeline` function uses `source_config.input` directly in `beam.io.ReadFromText`, which will attempt to read from the provided path without any further checks within the project's code.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure you have a Google Cloud project set up and the necessary tools configured (gcloud, make, etc.) as described in the README.
        - Identify a publicly readable file in a GCS bucket outside of the project's intended input data location (e.g., a public dataset in `gs://`). Let's call this `gs://public-dataset/test_file.txt`.
    2. **Modify `.env`:**
        - Set `INPUT_DATA` in the `.env` file to `gs://public-dataset/test_file.txt`.
        - Ensure other settings in `.env` are configured for a CPU-based Dataflow run (e.g., `run-df-cpu` target).
    3. **Run the pipeline:**
        - Execute the `run-df-cpu` make target: `make run-df-cpu`.
    4. **Observe the Dataflow job logs:**
        - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Dataflow job that was launched.
        - Examine the job logs.
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerability Confirmation):** If the vulnerability exists, the Dataflow job should attempt to read and process the contents of `gs://public-dataset/test_file.txt`. You might see log entries indicating successful read operations from this unexpected path, or errors if the file content format is incompatible with the pipeline's expectations for image paths, but importantly, it attempts to access the file. If input validation were in place, the job should have failed to launch or stopped early due to invalid input path before attempting to read from unexpected location.

#### 2. Potential Image Processing Vulnerabilities via Malicious Images

- **Description:**
    1. The pipeline reads image file paths from a GCS text file specified by the user.
    2. The `read_image` function in `my_project/pipeline.py` uses the PIL (Pillow) library's `Image.open()` to open and decode image files directly from the provided GCS paths.
    3. PIL is known to have vulnerabilities in its image decoding libraries, which can be triggered by specially crafted image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG, etc.).
    4. If an attacker can control the content of the input text file and include paths to malicious image files hosted on GCS, the `Image.open()` function could trigger a vulnerability when processing these malicious images during pipeline execution.
    5. Successful exploitation could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the Dataflow worker instances processing these images.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation of an image processing vulnerability in PIL could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Dataflow worker instances. This is a critical impact as it allows full control over the worker environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project directly uses PIL's `Image.open()` without any input validation or security measures to protect against malicious image files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation for image file paths: While not directly preventing image processing vulnerabilities, validating that image paths are within expected and trusted GCS locations can reduce the attack surface.
    - Input sanitization and validation for image data: Before processing images with PIL, implement checks to validate image headers or basic image properties to detect potentially malicious files. However, this is complex and might not be fully effective.
    - Using secure image processing libraries or sandboxing: Consider using more secure image processing libraries or sandboxing the image processing steps to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in PIL. Running image processing in isolated containers with restricted permissions could mitigate RCE risks.
    - Regularly update PIL: Keep the PIL library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. This is a general security best practice for all dependencies.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to influence the content of the input text file, which lists GCS paths to image files. This could be achieved by providing a crafted input file path via the `--input` parameter, assuming the "Unvalidated GCS Input Path" vulnerability is present, or by compromising the intended input data source.
    - The attacker needs to have access to upload or host malicious image files on GCS that can be referenced in the input text file. These malicious images must be crafted to exploit a known vulnerability in the version of PIL used by the Dataflow workers.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `my_project/pipeline.py`:
        ```python
        import io
        from PIL import Image
        from apache_beam.io.filesystems import FileSystems

        def read_image(image_file_name: Union[str, bytes], path_to_dir: Optional[str] = None) -> Tuple[str, Image.Image]:
            ...
            with FileSystems().open(image_file_name, "r") as file:
                data = Image.open(io.BytesIO(file.read())).convert("RGB") # POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY: Image.open()
                return image_file_name, data
        ```
        - The `read_image` function directly uses `Image.open()` from PIL to process image data read from GCS. This line is the entry point for potential image processing vulnerabilities if `Image.open()` encounters a malicious image file.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - You need to obtain or create a malicious image file that is designed to exploit a known vulnerability in PIL. Publicly available resources or vulnerability databases might provide examples of such files (e.g., search for "PIL PNG vulnerability exploit"). For testing purposes, you can attempt to use a known exploit image for a PIL vulnerability that affects the PIL version likely used in the Dataflow environment.
        - Upload this malicious image file to a publicly accessible GCS bucket. Let's say you upload it to `gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/malicious.png`.
    2. **Create Input Text File:**
        - Create a text file (e.g., `malicious_input.txt`) locally that contains a single line with the GCS path to your malicious image file:
          ```text
          gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/malicious.png
          ```
        - Upload this `malicious_input.txt` file to a GCS bucket that your Dataflow job can access (e.g., `gs://your-project-input-bucket/malicious_input.txt`).
    3. **Modify `.env`:**
        - Set `INPUT_DATA` in the `.env` file to the GCS path of your input text file: `gs://your-project-input-bucket/malicious_input.txt`.
        - Ensure other settings in `.env` are configured for a CPU-based Dataflow run (e.g., `run-df-cpu` target).
    4. **Run the pipeline:**
        - Execute the `run-df-cpu` make target: `make run-df-cpu`.
    5. **Monitor the Dataflow job and worker logs:**
        - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Dataflow job that was launched.
        - Examine the job logs and, more importantly, the worker logs (you might need to enable verbose worker logging for more detailed output).
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerability Indication):** If the malicious image successfully triggers a vulnerability in PIL, you might observe the following in the logs:
            - Worker crashes or restarts: The Dataflow worker processing the malicious image might crash unexpectedly.
            - Error messages related to image processing: Look for error messages in the logs that indicate issues during image decoding or processing by PIL.
            - Unexpected behavior or unusual log entries: If the exploit attempts to execute code, you might see logs or side effects that are not part of the normal pipeline operation.
            - **Note:** Successfully achieving RCE and reliably detecting it via logs in an automated test can be challenging. However, worker crashes and image processing errors are strong indicators of a potential vulnerability being triggered. A successful RCE exploit might not always leave easily detectable traces in logs, depending on the nature of the exploit. Further investigation and more sophisticated testing techniques might be needed to fully confirm RCE.

**Important Security Note:** Testing for image processing vulnerabilities, especially those potentially leading to RCE, should be performed in a controlled and isolated environment to prevent any unintended consequences or security breaches in production systems. Be extremely cautious when handling and processing potentially malicious image files.
