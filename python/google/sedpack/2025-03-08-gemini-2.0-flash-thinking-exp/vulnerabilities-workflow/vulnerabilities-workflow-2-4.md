- **Vulnerability Name:** Type Confusion in FlatBuffer Deserialization

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious Sedpack dataset.
  2. In the dataset metadata (dataset_info.json), the attacker manipulates the `dtype` field of an `Attribute` within the `saved_data_description`. The attacker sets this `dtype` to be inconsistent with the actual data type that will be stored in the shard file for this attribute. For example, the attacker sets `dtype` to "uint8" in metadata, while the actual data written into the shard file will be "float32".
  3. The attacker distributes or provides this maliciously crafted Sedpack dataset to a victim application that uses the Sedpack library to load and process data.
  4. The victim application uses Sedpack's API to read data from this dataset, for example using `dataset.as_numpy_iterator()` or `dataset.as_tfdataset()`.
  5. When Sedpack library processes the shard files of the malicious dataset, specifically in `IterateShardFlatBuffer.decode_array` function, it relies on the `dtype` information from the metadata to deserialize the byte data.
  6. Because the metadata is maliciously crafted, `IterateShardFlatBuffer.decode_array` uses the attacker-controlled `dtype` (e.g., "uint8") to interpret the raw bytes, instead of the actual data type (e.g., "float32").
  7. `np.frombuffer` in `IterateShardFlatBuffer.decode_array` then interprets the bytes as the incorrect data type ("uint8" in our example), leading to type confusion.
  8. The victim application receives and processes this incorrectly typed data, which can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or information disclosure depending on how the application processes the data downstream.

- **Impact:**
  - Information Disclosure: Incorrectly interpreting data types can lead to misinterpretation of sensitive data, potentially exposing information to unauthorized parties if the application further processes or displays this data.
  - Unexpected Behavior: Type confusion can cause the application to behave in unintended ways, potentially leading to errors, crashes, or incorrect processing of data, which can have security implications depending on the application's context.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - During serialization in `ShardWriterFlatBuffer.save_numpy_vector_as_bytearray`, there is a check `if not np.can_cast(value_np, to=attribute.dtype, casting="safe"):` to prevent writing data with incompatible types, but this mitigation is bypassed if the metadata itself is maliciously crafted after dataset creation. This check is in `/code/src/sedpack/io/shard/shard_writer_flatbuffer.py`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input validation: Sedpack lacks validation to ensure that the `dtype` and `shape` information in the loaded dataset metadata is consistent with the actual data in the shard files.
  - Type checking during deserialization:  `IterateShardFlatBuffer.decode_array` should perform runtime type checks to verify that the data being deserialized is consistent with the `dtype` specified in the metadata, or at least apply safe casting and handle potential errors gracefully.
  - Data integrity checks: Implement stronger data integrity checks beyond hash checksums, potentially including schema validation or data type assertions during data loading.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The victim application must load a maliciously crafted Sedpack dataset.
  - The attacker must be able to modify or create a Sedpack dataset, specifically the `dataset_info.json` metadata file, to manipulate the `dtype` of attributes.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File:** `/code/src/sedpack/io/flatbuffer/iterate.py`
  - **Function:** `IterateShardFlatBuffer.decode_array`
  - **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    dt = np.dtype(attribute.dtype)
    # FlatBuffers are little-endian. There is no byteswap by
    # `np.frombuffer` but the array will be interpreted correctly.
    dt = dt.newbyteorder("<")
    np_array = np.frombuffer(
        buffer=np_bytes,  # a view into the buffer, not a copy
        dtype=dt,
    )
    ```
  - **Vulnerability Explanation:**
    - The `decode_array` function directly uses `attribute.dtype` from the metadata to determine the data type `dt` for `np.frombuffer`.
    - If an attacker modifies `attribute.dtype` in the metadata to an incorrect value, `np.frombuffer` will misinterpret the raw bytes `np_bytes` as the attacker-specified type.
    - For example, if `np_bytes` actually contains `float32` data, but `attribute.dtype` is maliciously set to `uint8`, then `np.frombuffer` will interpret the float bytes as unsigned 8-bit integers, leading to type confusion and data corruption.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Create a legitimate Sedpack dataset with one attribute named "test_attribute" of dtype "float32" and shape (10,).
     - Fill the dataset with dummy float32 data.
     - Close the dataset filler to finalize shard files and metadata.
  2. **Malicious Modification:**
     - Open the `dataset_info.json` file of the created dataset.
     - Locate the `saved_data_description` section.
     - Find the entry for "test_attribute".
     - Modify the `dtype` field from "float32" to "uint8".
     - Save the modified `dataset_info.json` file.
  3. **Victim Application Execution:**
     - Write a simple Python script that uses Sedpack to load the maliciously modified dataset.
     - Iterate through the dataset using `dataset.as_numpy_iterator()`.
     - Print the `dtype` of the "test_attribute" for the first example retrieved from the iterator.
  4. **Verification:**
     - Run the victim application script.
     - Observe that the printed `dtype` of "test_attribute" is "uint8", even though the actual data was written as "float32". This demonstrates type confusion.
     - Further process the retrieved data in the victim application and observe unexpected behavior or corrupted data due to type mismatch. For instance, try to perform numerical operations expecting float32 data and observe errors or incorrect results due to the data being interpreted as uint8.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious user can manipulate the metadata to cause type confusion during deserialization, validating the vulnerability.
