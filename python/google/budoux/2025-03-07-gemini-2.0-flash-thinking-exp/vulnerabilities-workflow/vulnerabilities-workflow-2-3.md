### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML processing

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML input string containing JavaScript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    2. A user of BudouxX, intending to process HTML for line break optimization, feeds this malicious HTML string to BudouxX's HTML processing functionality, such as `translate_html_string` in Python, Java or Javascript, or uses the CLI with `-H` option.
    3. BudouxX's HTML processing functionality parses the HTML to identify text segments for line breaking. Crucially, it does **not sanitize** the HTML input.
    4. BudouxX inserts non-breaking space characters (`\u200b`) into the HTML string to control line breaks based on its model's prediction.
    5. BudouxX returns the modified HTML string as output. This output string still contains the attacker's malicious HTML code, including the `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` tag.
    6. If this output HTML is then used in a web context, for example, by embedding it into a webpage, the malicious JavaScript code injected by the attacker will be executed by the user's web browser.

* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The impact of XSS can be significant, potentially allowing an attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the web application using BudouxX's output.
    - Steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, authentication tokens, or user data.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as making unauthorized requests or modifying website content.
    - Deface the website or redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Injected scripts can be used for phishing attacks or to further compromise the user's system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project documentation, including README files in Python, Java, and Javascript modules, explicitly states that BudouxX does not sanitize inputs and warns against using it with untrusted HTML. However, this is a caveat and not a technical mitigation implemented in the code itself.
    - Example from `/code/README.md`:
    ```
    Caveat

    BudouX supports HTML inputs and outputs HTML strings with markup that wraps phrases, but it's not meant to be used as an HTML sanitizer. **BudouX doesn't sanitize any inputs.** Malicious HTML inputs yield malicious HTML outputs. Please use it with an appropriate sanitizer library if you don't trust the input.
    ```
    - Similar caveats are present in `/code/java/README.md` and `/code/javascript/README.md`.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The project lacks any form of HTML input sanitization. To mitigate this vulnerability, BudouxX should sanitize HTML input before processing it. This would involve parsing the HTML and removing or escaping any potentially malicious code, especially JavaScript event handlers and URLs in attributes that could execute JavaScript (e.g., `javascript:` URLs). Libraries like DOMPurify (for Javascript) or Bleach (for Python) could be integrated to sanitize HTML inputs.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must choose to process untrusted HTML content using BudouxX's HTML processing functionalities.
    - The output from BudouxX's HTML processing is used in a web context where it is rendered by a web browser.

* Source code analysis:
    - Python implementation (`/code/budoux/parser.py` and `/code/budoux/html_processor.py`):
        1.  `budoux/parser.py`: The `translate_html_string(self, html: str)` method in the `Parser` class is responsible for handling HTML input.
        ```python
        def translate_html_string(self, html: str) -> str:
            """Translates the given HTML string with markups for semantic line breaks.
            ...
            """
            text_content = get_text(html) # Extracts text content, but doesn't sanitize HTML
            chunks = self.parse(text_content) # Parses text content for line breaks
            return resolve(chunks, html) # Resolves chunks back into the original HTML, without sanitization
        ```
        2.  `budoux/html_processor.py`: The `get_text(html)` function uses `TextContentExtractor` to extract text content. `TextContentExtractor` extends `HTMLParser` from Python's standard library but only extracts text data and does not modify HTML tags or attributes in any way.
        ```python
        class TextContentExtractor(HTMLParser):
            """An HTML parser to extract text content.
            ...
            """
            output = ''

            def handle_data(self, data: str) -> None:
                self.output += data
        ```
        3.  `budoux/html_processor.py`: The `resolve(chunks, html, separator='\u200b')` function uses `HTMLChunkResolver` to insert separators. `HTMLChunkResolver` also extends `HTMLParser` and inserts separators based on provided chunks into the original HTML. It does not sanitize HTML tags or attributes.
        ```python
        class HTMLChunkResolver(HTMLParser):
            """An HTML parser to resolve the given HTML string and semantic chunks.
            ...
            """
            ...
            def handle_starttag(self, tag: str, attrs: HTMLAttr) -> None:
                ...
                self.output += '<%s%s>' % (tag, encoded_attrs) # Reconstructs start tag with original attributes

            def handle_endtag(self, tag: str) -> None:
                self.output += '</%s>' % (tag) # Reconstructs end tag

            def handle_data(self, data: str) -> None:
                ...
                self.output += char # Reconstructs text data
                ...
        ```
        - Visualization:
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[User Input (Malicious HTML)] --> B(translate_html_string);
            B --> C(get_text);
            C --> D[TextContentExtractor (No Sanitization)];
            B --> E(resolve);
            E --> F[HTMLChunkResolver (No Sanitization)];
            F --> G[Output (Malicious HTML with Separators)];
        ```
        - The code flow shows that the HTML input is parsed to extract text and then re-assembled with separators, but no sanitization step is included at any point. This allows malicious HTML to pass through unmodified.

* Security test case:
    1. Prepare a test file (e.g., `malicious_input.html`) with the following content:
    ```html
    <p>This is a test sentence with <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')"> malicious code.</p>
    ```
    2. Run the BudouxX CLI in HTML mode (`-H`) and pipe the malicious HTML file as input:
    ```bash
    budoux -H < malicious_input.html > output.html
    ```
    3. Open `output.html` in a web browser.
    4. Observe that an alert box appears with the message "XSS Vulnerability!". This confirms that the JavaScript code within the `onerror` attribute of the `<img>` tag was executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
    5. Alternatively, use the Python library directly in a test script:
    ```python
    import budoux

    parser = budoux.load_default_japanese_parser() # or any other language parser
    malicious_html = '<p>This is a test sentence with <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability!\')"> malicious code.</p>'
    output_html = parser.translate_html_string(malicious_html)
    print(output_html)
    # Save output_html to a file and open in browser to verify XSS, or use a headless browser for automated testing.
    ```
    6. Verify that the output HTML, when rendered in a browser, executes the injected JavaScript, proving the vulnerability.
