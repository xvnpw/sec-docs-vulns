- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML processing
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML string containing JavaScript code, such as `<p>Hello <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')"> World</p>`.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious HTML string as input to BudouX's HTML processing functionality, for example, by passing it to `translate_html_string` in Python, JavaScript, or `translateHTMLString` in Java.
    3. BudouX processes the HTML string using its internal HTML parser (`HTMLChunkResolver` in Python, and similar implementations in JavaScript and Java).
    4. BudouX inserts non-breaking space characters (`\u200b`) into the HTML string to control line breaks and wraps the entire output in a `<span>` tag with inline styles.
    5. Crucially, BudouX does **not** sanitize the input HTML. It processes and outputs the HTML string without removing or encoding any potentially malicious HTML tags or attributes, including the injected JavaScript code.
    6. The application using BudouX then renders the output HTML in a user's web browser.
    7. The browser executes the JavaScript code embedded in the malicious HTML, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
        - Cookie theft: Accessing and stealing sensitive information stored in cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting users to phishing or malware distribution sites.
        - Web page defacement: Altering the content and appearance of the web page.
        - Data theft: Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page or transmitted by the user.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user: Making unauthorized requests to the server or interacting with other users.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project explicitly states in the README files for Python, JavaScript, and Java modules under the "Caveat" section that: "**BudouX doesn't sanitize any inputs.** Malicious HTML inputs yield malicious HTML outputs."
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization is missing. BudouX should sanitize HTML inputs before processing them to prevent the injection of malicious code.
    - Implementing an HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or Bleach (for Python) before processing the HTML input in `translate_html_string` (and equivalent functions in other languages) would effectively mitigate this vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
    - The application or website must use BudouX to process HTML content.
    - The HTML content processed by BudouX must originate from or be influenced by user input or untrusted sources.
    - The output from BudouX's HTML processing must be rendered in a user's web browser without further sanitization or security measures.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `budoux/parser.py` (Python), the `translate_html_string` function calls `html_processor.resolve(chunks, html)`.
    - In `budoux/html_processor.py`, the `resolve` function utilizes `HTMLChunkResolver` to parse the HTML and insert word break markers.
    - `HTMLChunkResolver` extends `html.parser.HTMLParser`, which is designed for parsing HTML structure and extracting data, not for sanitization.
    - Neither `translate_html_string`, `resolve`, nor `HTMLChunkResolver` includes any code to sanitize or escape HTML entities that could lead to XSS.
    - The code directly processes and outputs the HTML structure, including any potentially malicious scripts or attributes embedded within it.
    - Similar code structure and lack of sanitization exist in the JavaScript and Java implementations as well.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Prepare a simple HTML web page that uses BudouX to process and display user-provided HTML. For example, in JavaScript, this could involve:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>BudouX XSS Test</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="budouxOutput"></div>
            <script type="module">
                import { loadDefaultJapaneseParser } from 'budoux';
                const parser = loadDefaultJapaneseParser();
                const outputDiv = document.getElementById('budouxOutput');
                const userInputHTML = '<p>Hello <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability!\')"> World</p>'; // Malicious HTML
                outputDiv.innerHTML = parser.translateHTMLString(userInputHTML);
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    2. **Execution:** Open the HTML page in a web browser.
    3. **Verification:** Observe the behavior of the page. If the XSS vulnerability exists, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" (or similar, depending on the injected code) will be displayed by the browser. This confirms that the JavaScript code injected through the `onerror` attribute in the `<img>` tag has been successfully executed, demonstrating the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability due to the lack of HTML sanitization in BudouX.
