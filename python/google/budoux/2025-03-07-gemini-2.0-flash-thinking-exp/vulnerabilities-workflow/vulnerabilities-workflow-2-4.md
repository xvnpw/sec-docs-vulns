*   **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML processing

*   **Description:**
    BudouxX processes HTML inputs and outputs HTML strings with added `<span>` tags to control line breaks. However, BudouxX does not sanitize the input HTML content. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code, including JavaScript, into the input text. When BudouxX processes this malicious input using functions like `translate_html_string` in Python, JavaScript, or `translateHTMLString` in Java, the malicious code is preserved and included in the output HTML. If this output is then rendered by a web browser, the injected malicious script will be executed in the user's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious HTML payload containing JavaScript code. For example: `<p><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')"></p>`.
    2.  The attacker provides this malicious HTML payload as input to BudouxX through its API (e.g., `translate_html_string` in Python, `translateHTMLString` in Javascript or Java) or via the command-line interface using the `-H` flag.
    3.  BudouxX processes the input HTML without sanitization and outputs an HTML string that includes the injected malicious script.
    4.  An application or website using BudouxX renders this output HTML in a user's web browser.
    5.  The browser executes the injected JavaScript code (`alert('XSS')` in the example), demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view content processed by BudouxX. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Credential Theft:**  Capturing user login credentials by injecting malicious forms or scripts that log keystrokes.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** Redirecting users to phishing sites or websites hosting malware.
    *   **Website Defacement:**  Modifying the content of the webpage displayed to the user.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive user data or application data accessible by JavaScript.
    *   **Denial of Service (Limited):**  Causing client-side errors or performance issues that degrade the user experience.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are currently implemented within BudouxX itself. The documentation explicitly states in multiple README files (root, java, javascript) under the "Caveat" section: "**BudouX doesn't sanitize any inputs.** Malicious HTML inputs yield malicious HTML outputs. Please use it with an appropriate sanitizer library if you don't trust the input." This serves as a warning to developers but does not mitigate the vulnerability within the library itself.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    The primary missing mitigation is input sanitization. BudouxX should implement HTML sanitization to process input HTML and remove or escape any potentially malicious code before generating its output HTML. This could involve:
    *   **HTML Encoding:** Encoding HTML entities to prevent interpretation as HTML tags or JavaScript.
    *   **Attribute Filtering:**  Removing or sanitizing potentially dangerous HTML attributes, especially event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, etc., and attributes like `href` and `src` that can point to malicious URLs.
    *   **Tag Filtering:**  Removing or allowing only a safe list of HTML tags.
    *   **Using a dedicated HTML Sanitization Library:** Integrating a robust and well-vetted HTML sanitization library to handle the complex task of HTML sanitization effectively.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The application or website must be using BudouxX to process HTML content.
    2.  The application or website must be rendering HTML output from BudouxX in a web browser without prior sanitization.
    3.  The input HTML to BudouxX must be sourced from an untrusted source, such as user-generated content or external data.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    *   **Python (`/code/budoux/parser.py`, `/code/budoux/html_processor.py`):**
        1.  `parser.py` - `Parser` class, `translate_html_string` method: This method is the entry point for HTML processing in Python. It calls `get_text` and `resolve` from `html_processor.py`.
        2.  `html_processor.py` - `get_text` function: Uses `TextContentExtractor` (derived from `html.parser.HTMLParser`) to extract text content from HTML. `HTMLParser` itself does not perform sanitization; it's designed for parsing HTML structure and content.
        3.  `html_processor.py` - `resolve` function: Uses `HTMLChunkResolver` (derived from `html.parser.HTMLParser`) to insert separators (`\u200b`) into the HTML based on the parsed chunks.  `HTMLChunkResolver` also extends `HTMLParser` and thus inherits its parsing behavior without sanitization. It focuses on re-assembling the HTML with separators.
        4.  **Visualization:**

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[parser.translate_html_string] --> B(html_processor.get_text)
            B --> C(TextContentExtractor)
            A --> D(html_processor.resolve)
            D --> E(HTMLChunkResolver)
            C -- HTML Text --> D
            F[Untrusted HTML Input] --> A
            D --> G[HTML Output with potential XSS]
            G --> H[Web Browser Rendering]
            H --> I[JavaScript Execution]
        ```

        **Analysis:** The code flow clearly shows that the HTML input is parsed to extract text and then re-assembled with separators.  Neither `TextContentExtractor` nor `HTMLChunkResolver` includes any HTML sanitization logic. They process and reconstruct HTML, faithfully including any malicious scripts or HTML provided in the input.

    *   **JavaScript (`/code/javascript/README.md`):**
        The JavaScript README and code (not provided in PROJECT FILES but referenced) indicate similar functionality with `translateHTMLString` and `HTMLProcessor`, suggesting a similar lack of sanitization in the JavaScript implementation.

    *   **Java (`/code/java/README.md`):**
        The Java README and code (not provided in PROJECT FILES but referenced) show `translateHTMLString` method in the `Parser` class, implying the same vulnerability exists in the Java version.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Use the Python BudouxX library. Ensure it is installed (`pip install budoux`).
    2.  **Malicious HTML Payload:** Create a string variable in Python containing the following malicious HTML payload:
        ```python
        malicious_html_input = '<p>This is a test sentence with malicious code: <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability in BudouxX!\')"></p>'
        ```
    3.  **Process with BudouxX:** Load the default Japanese parser (or any parser) and use `translate_html_string` to process the malicious input:
        ```python
        import budoux
        parser = budoux.load_default_japanese_parser()
        output_html = parser.translate_html_string(malicious_html_input)
        print(output_html)
        ```
    4.  **Render Output in Browser:** Copy the `output_html` string from the Python output and paste it into an HTML file (e.g., `test_xss.html`). Open `test_xss.html` in a web browser.
    5.  **Verification:** Observe that an alert box pops up in the browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability in BudouxX!". This confirms that the JavaScript code injected via the `onerror` attribute in the `<img>` tag was executed, demonstrating the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

    This test case can be adapted for JavaScript and Java implementations by using their respective APIs and rendering the output HTML in a browser to verify the XSS vulnerability.
