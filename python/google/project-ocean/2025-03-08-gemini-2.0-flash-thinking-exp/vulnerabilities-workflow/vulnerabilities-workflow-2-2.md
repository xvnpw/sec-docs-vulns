### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Phishing via Malicious Link in Dataset Suggestion
* Description:
    1. An attacker creates a new issue on the project's GitHub repository to suggest a dataset.
    2. In the issue description, the attacker fills in the "Reference Links" field with a malicious URL. This URL could lead to a phishing website designed to steal credentials or sensitive information from project maintainers or researchers.
    3. Project maintainers or researchers review the issue on GitHub.
    4. Unsuspecting maintainers or researchers click on the malicious link in the "Reference Links" section, believing it to be a legitimate resource related to the dataset.
    5. The user is redirected to a phishing website controlled by the attacker.
* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: If project maintainers' or researchers' credentials are stolen, attackers could gain unauthorized access to project resources, including the GitHub repository, cloud infrastructure, and sensitive datasets.
    - Data Breach: Attackers might use compromised accounts to exfiltrate or manipulate project data.
    - Reputational Damage: The project's reputation could be harmed if maintainers or researchers are successfully phished.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project currently does not have any specific mitigations in place to prevent users from posting malicious links in GitHub issues. The CONTRIBUTING.md and code-of-conduct.md files focus on code contributions and community guidelines, but do not address link safety in issue submissions.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement checks to scan URLs submitted in issue descriptions for known malicious patterns or blacklisted domains.
    - Link Warning: Display a warning message to project maintainers and researchers when a user-submitted issue contains external links, advising caution before clicking.
    - Issue Template Enhancement: Modify the issue template to explicitly warn users against including suspicious links and to advise maintainers to be cautious when reviewing external links.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) for GitHub Pages: If the project uses GitHub Pages or similar to display project information, implement a CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS if malicious links are somehow rendered directly. However, this is less relevant for the described attack vector which relies on social engineering.
    - Training and Awareness: Educate project maintainers and researchers about phishing risks and best practices for handling external links, especially in user-submitted content.
* Preconditions:
    - Publicly accessible GitHub repository for project OCEAN.
    - Ability for anyone to create issues in the GitHub repository.
    - Project maintainers or researchers regularly review and process GitHub issues.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not contain specific source code related to handling GitHub issues or dataset suggestions. The vulnerability is not within the Go or Python code of the data pipelines, but rather in the project's workflow of accepting dataset suggestions via GitHub issues.
    - The vulnerability exists because GitHub issues allow users to post arbitrary text, including URLs, without automatic security checks or warnings within the project's GitHub workflow.
    - Reviewing the files, there are no scripts or configurations that parse or sanitize issue content for malicious links before maintainers review them.
* Security Test Case:
    1. As an external attacker, access the project's GitHub repository.
    2. Create a new issue by clicking on "Issues" tab and then "New issue".
    3. Use the provided "Issue Template" or create a blank issue.
    4. Fill in the issue title, for example: "Dataset Suggestion: Awesome Open Source Data".
    5. In the issue description, under "Reference Links", insert a malicious link, for example: `[Malicious Link](http://attacker-phishing-website.com)`. Add other dataset details to make the issue look legitimate.
    6. Submit the issue by clicking "Submit new issue".
    7. As a project maintainer or researcher, access the project's GitHub repository and navigate to the "Issues" tab.
    8. Open the newly created issue "Dataset Suggestion: Awesome Open Source Data".
    9. Observe the "Reference Links" section in the issue description.
    10. Click on the "Malicious Link".
    11. Verify that you are redirected to the attacker-controlled phishing website (`http://attacker-phishing-website.com`).

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can successfully inject a malicious link into a dataset suggestion issue, and a project member clicking on it would be redirected to a potentially harmful website.
