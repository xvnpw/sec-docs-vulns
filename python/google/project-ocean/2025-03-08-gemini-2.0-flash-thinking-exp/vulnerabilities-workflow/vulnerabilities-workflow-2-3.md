- Vulnerability Name: Potential for Malicious Links in Issue Reports
- Description:
  1. An attacker submits a new issue report suggesting a dataset for the Project OCEAN.
  2. In the description of the issue report, the attacker includes malicious links disguised as legitimate dataset references or further reading materials. These links can be crafted using markdown syntax within the issue description.
  3. Project maintainers or contributors review the issue report on the project's GitHub repository.
  4. Unsuspecting maintainers or contributors, while reviewing the issue report, click on the malicious links embedded in the issue report description.
  5. Clicking on these malicious links can redirect the maintainer or contributor to external websites controlled by the attacker. These websites could be designed for phishing attacks (to steal credentials), for delivering malware downloads, or for other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's intent.
- Impact:
  - Phishing: If the malicious link leads to a phishing page, maintainers or contributors could be tricked into entering their credentials, potentially compromising their accounts and possibly project resources if maintainer accounts are targeted.
  - Malware Infection: If the link leads to a malicious file download, clicking the link could result in malware infection of the maintainer's or contributor's system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further propagation of malware.
  - Reputational Damage: If contributors or maintainers are harmed by clicking on malicious links within project resources, it can damage the project's reputation and erode trust within the open-source community.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. Based on the provided project files, there are no evident mitigations implemented within the project's code or issue handling processes to prevent or detect malicious links in issue reports. The project relies on the standard functionality of GitHub issues, which renders markdown links without automatic security checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: Implement input sanitization for issue report descriptions. This could involve:
    - Automatically scanning issue report content for URLs and checking them against known malicious link databases.
    - Using a URL rewriting mechanism to redirect all external links through a safe redirector service that checks the URL before redirecting the user.
    - Removing or disabling hyperlink functionality for URLs in issue descriptions, rendering them as plain text to prevent accidental clicks.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP): While not directly applicable to GitHub issues themselves, if the Project OCEAN were to develop a web application or interface for managing datasets or issues, implementing a strict Content Security Policy would be crucial to mitigate the risk of XSS and further control the sources from which the application can load resources.
  - Maintainer/Contributor Education: Provide clear guidelines and training to project maintainers and contributors about the risks of clicking on external links in issue reports and other project communications. Educate them on best practices for verifying the safety of links before clicking, such as hovering over links to check the destination URL and using online URL scanners.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker Account: The attacker needs a valid GitHub account to be able to submit issue reports to the Project OCEAN repository.
  - Project Access: Project maintainers or contributors must access the project's GitHub repository and specifically view the "Issues" section where the malicious issue report has been submitted.
  - User Interaction: A project maintainer or contributor must manually click on the malicious link embedded within the issue report description for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - Code Review: A review of the provided source code files (`/code` directory) shows that the project primarily focuses on data collection and analysis pipelines, particularly for mailing list data. There is no custom code present for handling or processing GitHub issue reports, nor is there any code related to input sanitization or URL validation within these files.
  - GitHub Issues Reliance: The project's `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files explicitly direct users to submit dataset suggestions and project issues through GitHub's issue tracking system. This indicates that the project relies on GitHub's built-in issue functionality without implementing any custom security layers for issue content.
  - Vulnerability Location: The vulnerability is not located in the provided source code itself, but rather in the project's process of accepting and reviewing user-submitted content through GitHub issues without adequate security measures to handle potentially malicious links. The risk is introduced by the combination of open issue submission and the lack of link sanitization or user awareness.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Attacker Setup: As an external attacker, create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
  2. Issue Creation:
     - Go to the Project OCEAN GitHub repository.
     - Navigate to the "Issues" tab.
     - Click on the "New issue" button.
     - Choose the "Suggest a dataset" issue template if available, or select a blank issue template.
     - In the issue title, enter a relevant title, for example: "Suggestion for a New Open Source Dataset".
     - In the issue description field, craft a message that includes a malicious link disguised as a legitimate resource. For example:
       ```markdown
       We should consider including the "Example Dataset" in our data map. You can find more details about this dataset at [Check out this dataset](https://malicious.example.com). This dataset would be very valuable for our research.
       ```
       **Note:** For a safe test, replace `https://malicious.example.com` with a safe URL like `https://example.com` or a URL redirection service like `https://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=https://example.com` to simulate redirection without visiting a harmful site.
     - Submit the new issue by clicking the "Submit new issue" button.
  3. Maintainer/Contributor Action:
     - As a project maintainer or contributor, access the Project OCEAN GitHub repository.
     - Navigate to the "Issues" tab.
     - Open the newly created issue with the title "Suggestion for a New Open Source Dataset" (or the title you used).
     - Locate the link "Check out this dataset" in the issue description.
     - Click on the link.
  4. Verification:
     - Observe the URL in your browser's address bar after clicking the link.
     - If you used `https://malicious.example.com` (or your safe test URL replacement), verify that you are redirected to `https://malicious.example.com` (or your safe test URL). This redirection confirms the vulnerability: an attacker can successfully embed clickable links in issue reports that can redirect project members to arbitrary external websites, including potentially malicious ones.
