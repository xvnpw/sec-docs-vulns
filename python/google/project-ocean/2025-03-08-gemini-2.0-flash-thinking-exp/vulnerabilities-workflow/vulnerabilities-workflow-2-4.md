### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Unsanitized URL Processing via Stored 'original_url'

- Description:
    1. The `extract_msgs.py` and `msgs_storage_bq.py` scripts process email messages and extract various headers and body content.
    2. Within the `get_msg_objs_list` function, if an email message body contains the string "original_url:", the script extracts the value following this string and stores it as the `original_url` field in BigQuery.
    3. An attacker could craft a dataset suggestion that, when processed (although the exact mechanism is not in provided files), results in email messages being ingested that contain a malicious URL within the body, following the "original_url:" string.
    4. These scripts will parse these messages and store the malicious URL in the `original_url` field in the BigQuery table.
    5. If another component of Project OCEAN later reads data from this BigQuery table and processes the `original_url` field (e.g., for display, fetching content, or any other operation), and if this component does not properly sanitize or validate the URL, it could be vulnerable to attacks such as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or potentially other vulnerabilities depending on how the URL is processed in that downstream component. While the provided scripts themselves do not directly execute code or fetch from arbitrary URLs, they facilitate storing potentially malicious URLs which could be exploited later.

- Impact:
    - **Medium**: The direct impact within the provided scripts is low as they only store the URL. However, if a downstream component of Project OCEAN unsafely processes the stored `original_url`, the impact could be significant. Depending on how the URL is processed in the downstream component, it could lead to:
        - **SSRF**: If the downstream component attempts to fetch content from the `original_url` without sanitization, an attacker could potentially make the server make requests to internal resources or external servers they control.
        - **Information Disclosure**: SSRF can sometimes lead to information disclosure by accessing internal metadata or resources.
        - **Further Exploitation**: Depending on the downstream component's functionality, SSRF can be a stepping stone to other attacks, although RCE is less likely in this specific scenario based on the provided code.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: The provided scripts do not implement any sanitization or validation of the `original_url` extracted from email messages. They simply extract and store it in BigQuery.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: The scripts should sanitize the `original_url` before storing it in BigQuery. At the very least, URL validation should be performed to ensure it's a valid URL and conforms to expected formats. Ideally, a strict whitelist of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`) and domain patterns should be implemented if the downstream usage is known.
    - **Documentation for Downstream Components**: If there are downstream components that process the `original_url` from BigQuery, clear documentation and security guidelines should be provided to developers of those components, emphasizing the need for strict URL sanitization and validation before any processing.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of email messages that are processed by the `extract_msgs.py` or `msgs_storage_bq.py` scripts, specifically by including "original_url:" followed by a malicious URL in the email body. This might be achieved through dataset suggestion mechanisms (though not explicitly detailed in the provided files).
    2. A downstream component of Project OCEAN must exist that reads the `original_url` field from the BigQuery table and processes it in an unsafe manner (e.g., attempts to fetch content from it without sanitization).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/archive/mailing-list-data-pipelines/2-transform-data/manual_bq_ingest/extract_msgs.py` and `/code/archive/mailing-list-data-pipelines/2-transform-data/cloud_func_bq_ingest/msgs_storage_bq.py` (both scripts have similar logic).
    2. **Function:** `get_msg_objs_list(msgs, bucketname, filenamepath)`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def get_msg_objs_list(msgs, bucketname, filenamepath):
        # ...
        for msg in msgs:
            # ...
            if "original_url:" in msg:
                val = re.split(r'original_url:', msg)
                msg_parts.append(('original_url', val[1]))
            # ...
    ```
    4. **Analysis:**
        - The code iterates through messages (`msgs`).
        - For each message (`msg`), it checks if the string "original_url:" is present.
        - If found, it uses `re.split(r'original_url:', msg)` to split the message string at "original_url:". `val[1]` then contains the part of the string *after* "original_url:".
        - This extracted string (`val[1]`) is directly appended to `msg_parts` as `('original_url', val[1])` without any sanitization or validation.
        - Subsequently, this `msg_parts` list is converted to JSON and stored in BigQuery.
    5. **Vulnerability:** The code blindly extracts the string after "original_url:" and stores it. There's no check to ensure this is a valid URL, safe URL, or even a URL at all. This unsanitized data is then persisted in BigQuery.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisite:** Access to submit a dataset suggestion or a mechanism to inject email messages into the processing pipeline (if such a mechanism exists for testing purposes). Assume you can submit a dataset suggestion that will eventually lead to processing of a crafted email message.
    2. **Craft a Malicious Email Message:** Create an email message (or simulate its content) that includes the following in its body:
    ```
    ... (email headers and other content) ...
    original_url: http://attacker.com/malicious-path
    ... (rest of email body) ...
    ```
       Replace `http://attacker.com/malicious-path` with a URL you control for testing purposes (e.g., `https://webhook.site/your-unique-webhook`).
    3. **Submit Dataset Suggestion:** Submit a dataset suggestion that, through the project's workflow, will result in the crafted email message being processed by the `extract_msgs.py` or `msgs_storage_bq.py` scripts. The exact submission method would depend on Project OCEAN's UI/API for dataset suggestions (not provided in files, so assume a generic submission process).
    4. **Trigger Data Processing:** Ensure the data processing pipeline is triggered to process the email message (this might be an automated process or require manual triggering, depending on the project setup).
    5. **Inspect BigQuery:** After the processing is complete, query the BigQuery table where the email data is stored. Look for the entry corresponding to your injected email message.
    6. **Verify 'original_url' Field:** Check the value of the `original_url` field for the processed email message. It should contain the malicious URL `http://attacker.com/malicious-path` (or `https://webhook.site/your-unique-webhook`).
    7. **Simulate Downstream Component (Manual Check):** For testing, *manually simulate* a downstream component that reads this `original_url` from BigQuery. In a real scenario, this would be another application within Project OCEAN. For simulation, you could write a simple script or manually attempt to access the URL from the BigQuery data.
    8. **Observe Downstream Behavior:** If the simulated downstream component attempts to access the `original_url` without sanitization, observe the behavior. For example, if you used `https://webhook.site/your-unique-webhook`, you should see an HTTP request in your webhook.site logs originating from the Project OCEAN server, confirming SSRF potential. If the downstream component is designed to display the URL, observe if it's displayed without proper encoding, potentially leading to other issues in a browser context if the URL was crafted for that purpose.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious URL can be injected and stored. Further investigation into downstream components is needed to fully assess the exploitability and impact of this stored unsanitized URL.
