### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Content Security Policy (CSP) Weakening leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Description:
    - The Secure Scaffold library encourages users to customize the default Content Security Policy (CSP) for their Flask applications.
    - The default CSP is based on `flask_talisman.GOOGLE_CSP_POLICY`, which is designed to be secure.
    - Users can weaken the CSP by modifying the `CSP_POLICY` setting in their application's configuration files (e.g., `settings.py`).
    - If a user weakens the CSP, for example, by adding `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'`, or allowing scripts from untrusted domains in `script-src`, or by setting `script-src` or `style-src` to `'*' `or removing them completely, they may introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - An attacker could then inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, potentially stealing user credentials, session tokens, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
- Impact:
    - High - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to a wide range of attacks, including:
        - Account takeover
        - Session hijacking
        - Data theft
        - Defacement of the website
        - Redirection to malicious websites
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Default secure CSP: The project provides a secure default CSP based on `flask_talisman.GOOGLE_CSP_POLICY`. This is implemented in `src/securescaffold/settings.py` and applied in `src/securescaffold/factory.py`.
    - Documentation: The `README.md` and `examples/python-app/README-secure-scaffold.md` files mention CSP and link to Flask-Talisman documentation, implicitly suggesting users should be careful when modifying CSP.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Stronger warnings in documentation about the risks of weakening CSP.
    - Security checks or recommendations to validate the customized CSP against common pitfalls (e.g., usage of 'unsafe-inline', 'unsafe-eval', overly permissive `script-src` or `style-src`).
    - Example configurations of weakened CSP with clear warnings against using them in production.
- Preconditions:
    - The developer must intentionally weaken the default CSP configuration by modifying `CSP_POLICY` in their application settings.
    - The application must be deployed and accessible to external attackers.
    - The application must have a part vulnerable to XSS if CSP is weakened (e.g., user input reflected without proper escaping, usage of `eval()` or similar unsafe functions).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/securescaffold/settings.py`: Defines the default `CSP_POLICY` using `flask_talisman.GOOGLE_CSP_POLICY`. This is a secure default.
    - `src/securescaffold/factory.py`: The `create_app` function reads configuration, including `CSP_POLICY`, and passes it to `flask_talisman.Talisman`.
    - `examples/python-app/settings.py`: Example shows how to customize `CSP_POLICY`. In this example, `script-src` and `style-src` are intentionally left empty, relying on nonces. While this specific configuration using nonces can be secure if implemented correctly in templates, it demonstrates how users are expected to modify `CSP_POLICY`. If a user incorrectly configures `CSP_POLICY` here, they can weaken security. For example, if a developer changes `examples/python-app/settings.py` to:

    ```python
    CSP_POLICY = {
        "default-src": "'none'",
        "script-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'", # Added 'unsafe-inline'
        "style-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'", # Added 'unsafe-inline'
    }
    CSP_POLICY_NONCE_IN = ["script-src", "style-src"]
    ```
    This would weaken the CSP and allow inline scripts, potentially leading to XSS if the application has any XSS-prone areas.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Deploy the `examples/python-app` to Google App Engine. Assume the deployed application URL is `https://example-app.appspot.com`.
    - Step 2: Modify the `examples/python-app/settings.py` file to weaken the CSP by adding `'unsafe-inline'` to `script-src` and `style-src`:
    ```python
    CSP_POLICY = {
        "default-src": "'none'",
        "script-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
        "style-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
    }
    CSP_POLICY_NONCE_IN = ["script-src", "style-src"]
    ```
    - Step 3: Deploy the modified application again using `gcloud app deploy --project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] app.yaml`.
    - Step 4: Identify an XSS vulnerability in the application. For simplicity, let's assume we modify `/csrf` route in `examples/python-app/main.py` to be vulnerable to reflected XSS. Modify the `csrf()` function and `csrf.html` template to reflect the `first_name` parameter without escaping.

    ```python
    # examples/python-app/main.py (modified csrf function)
    @app.route("/csrf", methods=["GET", "POST"])
    def csrf():
        """Demonstration of using CSRF to protect a form."""
        context = {
            "page_title": "CSRF protection",
            "message": "",
        }

        if flask.request.method == "POST":
            first_name = flask.request.form.get("first-name")

            if first_name:
                # Vulnerability: Reflecting input without escaping
                context["message"] = f"Hello {first_name}!"

        return flask.render_template("csrf.html", **context)
    ```

    ```html
    {# examples/python-app/templates/csrf.html (modified csrf.html) #}
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block content %}
      <h1>{{ page_title }}</h1>

      <form method="POST">
        {{ csrf_token() }}
        <label for="first-name">First Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="first-name" name="first-name">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

      <p>{{ message | safe }}</p> <!-- Marked as safe, intentionally vulnerable -->

    {% endblock %}
    ```
    - Step 5: Craft a malicious POST request to `/csrf` with a JavaScript payload in the `first-name` field. For example:

    ```
    POST /csrf HTTP/1.1
    Host: example-app.appspot.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    csrf_token=YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN&first-name=<script>alert("XSS")</script>
    ```
    - Step 6: Send the request and observe the response in a browser. You should see an alert box with "XSS" message, demonstrating successful XSS execution because the weakened CSP now allows inline scripts.

    - Step 7: Verify CSP headers. Inspect the HTTP headers of the response. You should see `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';` confirming the weakened CSP is in effect.

    This test case demonstrates that by weakening the CSP configuration, a developer can introduce XSS vulnerabilities in their Secure Scaffold application.
