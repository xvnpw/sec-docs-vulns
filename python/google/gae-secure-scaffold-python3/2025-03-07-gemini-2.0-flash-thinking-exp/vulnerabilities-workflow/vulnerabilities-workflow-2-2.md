- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Markdown Rendering leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Description: The Python application example `/examples/python-app/main.py` renders Markdown content from `README.md` to HTML without proper sanitization. It uses `mistune.create_markdown` with a custom `Anchors` renderer and then marks the output as safe using `markupsafe.Markup`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `README.md` file. When a user visits the application's root path `/`, this malicious code will be executed in their browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.
- Impact: High. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to account hijacking, session theft, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, or information disclosure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The example code explicitly mentions in comments that the Markdown rendering is unsafe and should not be used in production.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize the Markdown input before rendering it to HTML. Use a markdown rendering library that provides options for sanitization or escapes HTML by default.
    - Avoid using `markupsafe.Markup` to mark unsanitized content as safe.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the `README.md` file. While direct modification of this file on a deployed application is unlikely, this example serves as a template, and developers might replicate this insecure pattern in their own projects.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/examples/python-app/main.py`
    - The `about` view function reads the content of `README.md`, renders it to HTML using `mistune.create_markdown(renderer=Anchors())`, and then incorrectly marks it as safe using `markupsafe.Markup(readme)`.
    - ```python
      @app.route("/")
      def about():
          """One-page introduction to Secure Scaffold.

          This renders Markdown to HTML on-the-fly, trusting the Markdown content
          can be used to generate <a> tags. Do not do this on production sites!
          """

          # The Anchors renderer trusts the headers in the Markdown file.
          with open("README.md") as fh:
              m = mistune.create_markdown(renderer=Anchors())
              readme = m(fh.read())
              readme = markupsafe.Markup(readme) # Marks unsanitized content as safe!

          context = {
              "page_title": "Secure Scaffold",
              "readme": readme,
          }

          return flask.render_template("about.html", **context) # Renders unsanitized markdown
      ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the `/code/examples/python-app/README.md` file to include a malicious JavaScript payload within the markdown content:
       ```markdown
       ## Vulnerability Demonstration
       This is a demonstration of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

       <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
       ```
    2. Deploy the `python-app` example to Google App Engine or run it locally using `dev_appserver.py .` inside the `/code/examples/python-app/` directory.
    3. Access the root URL of the deployed application (e.g., `https://your-project.appspot.com/` or `http://localhost:8080/` if running locally).
    4. Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" pops up in the browser. This demonstrates that the injected JavaScript code from `README.md` was executed, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Content Security Policy (CSP) Weakness in Python App Example Settings
- Description: The default Content Security Policy (CSP) in the Secure Scaffold is intentionally strict to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. However, the example settings file `/code/examples/python-app/settings.py` significantly weakens the CSP by setting both `script-src` and `style-src` directives to empty strings. This effectively bypasses CSP protection for inline scripts and styles, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks that CSP is designed to prevent. While nonces are configured for `script-src` and `style-src`, the lack of any allowed sources means no external or 'self' sources are permitted, but inline and unsafe-eval are implicitly allowed, thus weakening security.
- Impact: High. By weakening the CSP, the application's attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities is significantly increased. Attackers can more easily inject and execute malicious scripts and styles within the application.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The base scaffold uses Flask-Talisman to implement CSP, and the default settings in `/code/src/securescaffold/settings.py` include a strong, Google-recommended CSP policy.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The example settings file `/code/examples/python-app/settings.py` should not weaken the CSP. It should either use the default strong CSP or provide a secure, properly configured custom CSP that does not disable crucial protections.
    - The example should highlight the importance of a strong CSP and guide developers on how to customize it securely, rather than providing insecure configurations.
- Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed using the settings from `/code/examples/python-app/settings.py` or a similar configuration that weakens the CSP by setting `script-src` and `style-src` to empty strings. Developers who use this example as a starting point or copy these settings into their projects will inherit this vulnerability.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/examples/python-app/settings.py`
    - The `CSP_POLICY` dictionary in this file defines a weakened CSP that sets `script-src` and `style-src` to empty strings.
    - ```python
      CSP_POLICY = {
          "default-src": "'none'",
          "script-src": "", # Vulnerability: Empty script-src weakens CSP
          "style-src": "",  # Vulnerability: Empty style-src weakens CSP
      }
      CSP_POLICY_NONCE_IN = ["script-src", "style-src"]
      ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `python-app` example to Google App Engine or run it locally using `dev_appserver.py .` inside the `/code/examples/python-app/` directory. Ensure that the application is using the settings from `/code/examples/python-app/settings.py`.
    2. Access the root URL of the deployed application (e.g., `https://your-project.appspot.com/` or `http://localhost:8080/` if running locally) and inspect the `Content-Security-Policy` header in the HTTP response.
    3. Verify that the `script-src` and `style-src` directives in the CSP header are set to empty strings. This indicates a weakened CSP.
    4. To demonstrate the impact, attempt to inject an inline JavaScript payload into the page. For example, you can try to append `?param=<script>alert("CSP Weakness");</script>` to the URL if the application reflects URL parameters unsafely (or use other XSS vectors if applicable).
    5. Observe that the injected inline script executes (e.g., an alert box with "CSP Weakness" appears). This confirms that the weakened CSP is not effectively preventing inline scripts, demonstrating the vulnerability. If no reflected XSS is readily available, you can manually inject inline script into the rendered HTML in browser's developer tools and observe it executing, bypassing the intended CSP protection due to its weak configuration.
