- Vulnerability Name: Publicly Accessible Cron Job Handlers
- Description:
    1. Developer creates a cron job handler in their Flask application to perform background tasks on a schedule.
    2. Developer forgets to apply the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator to this handler.
    3. The cron job handler endpoint becomes publicly accessible without any authentication or authorization checks specific to cron jobs.
    4. An attacker discovers or guesses the URL of the cron job handler.
    5. Attacker sends a request to the cron job handler endpoint from outside the Google Cloud Platform environment, bypassing intended cron job execution restrictions.
    6. The application executes the cron job handler logic as if it were triggered by the cron scheduler, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- Impact:
    If a cron job handler is intended for internal background tasks and becomes publicly accessible, attackers can trigger these tasks at will. The impact depends on the functionality of the cron job, but could include:
    - Data manipulation: Cron jobs might modify data in the application's datastore or database.
    - Information disclosure: Cron jobs could generate reports or export sensitive information.
    - Resource exhaustion:  Repeatedly triggering cron jobs could consume application resources and impact performance.
    - Financial impact: If cron jobs interact with paid services, unauthorized execution could lead to unexpected costs.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project provides the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator in `src/securescaffold/environ.py`. This decorator checks if the request originates from the App Engine cron scheduler or an admin user by inspecting the `X-Appengine-Queuename` header.
    - The documentation in `README.md` and `examples/python-app/README-secure-scaffold.md` explicitly warns developers about the necessity of using the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator for cron job handlers.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - There is no enforced usage of the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator. The library relies on developers to manually apply the decorator to their cron job handlers.
    - The Cookiecutter template does not automatically apply the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator to example cron job handlers, which could lead to developers overlooking this security requirement.
    - No automated checks or linters are provided to detect missing `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorators on functions that are intended to be cron job handlers.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer creates a Flask application using the `securescaffold` library.
    - The application includes one or more cron job handlers defined as Flask routes.
    - The developer deploys the application to Google App Engine.
    - The developer configures cron jobs in `cron.yaml` that target the created cron job handler endpoints.
    - The developer forgets to decorate the cron job handler function with `@securescaffold.cron_only`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/securescaffold/environ.py`**:
        ```python
        X_APPENGINE_QUEUENAME = "X-Appengine-Queuename"
        ...
        def cron_only(func):
            """Checks the request is from the Tasks scheduler (or an admin)."""
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                request = flask.request

                if is_tasks_or_admin_request(request): # is_tasks_or_admin_request uses is_tasks_request which checks X_APPENGINE_QUEUENAME
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)

                flask.abort(403) # returns 403 Forbidden if not cron or admin request

            return _wrapper
        ...
        def is_tasks_request(request) -> bool:
            """True if the request is from the Tasks scheduler.
            This also works for requests from the Cron scheduler.
            """
            value = request.headers.get(X_APPENGINE_QUEUENAME) # Checks for X-Appengine-Queuename header
            return bool(value)
        ...
        is_cron_request = is_tasks_request
        cron_only = tasks_only # cron_only is alias for tasks_only
        ```
        The `cron_only` decorator checks for the `X-Appengine-Queuename` header in the request. This header is added by Google App Engine when a cron job is executed. If the header is present or if the request is from an admin, the decorated function is executed; otherwise, a 403 Forbidden error is returned.

    2. **`README.md` and `examples/python-app/README-secure-scaffold.md`**:
        These files contain documentation that highlights the importance of using the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator for securing cron job handlers. They explicitly state: "**You must decorate a cron request handler with `@securescaffold.cron_only` to prevent unauthorized requests.**" and provide an example:
        ```python
        @app.route("/cron")
        @app.talisman(force_https=False)
        @securescaffold.cron_only
        def cron_task():
            # This request handler is protected by the `securescaffold.cron_only`
            # decorator so will only be called if the request is from the cron
            # scheduler or from an App Engine project admin.
            return ""
        ```
        However, this is only documentation and examples, not enforced in code.

    3. **Absence of Enforcement**:
        The `securescaffold` library does not enforce the use of `@securescaffold.cron_only`. If a developer forgets to use it, the cron job handler will be exposed. There are no tests or linters in the project to verify the correct usage of this decorator.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create a Flask application using `securescaffold`.
        - Define a route `/vulnerable-cron` that simulates a cron job handler but **do not** decorate it with `@securescaffold.cron_only`. This handler should perform an action that is easily observable, for example, logging a message or modifying data in the datastore. For simplicity, let's assume it just returns a specific string.
        ```python
        # main.py
        import securescaffold
        app = securescaffold.create_app(__name__)

        @app.route("/vulnerable-cron")
        def vulnerable_cron_task():
            return "Cron task executed!"
        ```
        - Deploy this application to Google App Engine.
        - Ensure IAP is **disabled** or configured to allow public access to demonstrate the vulnerability without authentication blocking the request first.

    2. **Exploit**:
        - Open a web browser or use `curl` to send a GET request to `https://<your-app-id>.appspot.com/vulnerable-cron`.

    3. **Verification**:
        - Observe the response. If the vulnerability exists, the application will respond with "Cron task executed!" and HTTP status code 200, indicating that the cron job handler was executed despite the request not originating from the cron scheduler.
        - If the handler is not accessible (e.g., 404 Not Found), ensure the route `/vulnerable-cron` is correctly defined in your application and `app.yaml`. If you get a 403 Forbidden, it would indicate `@securescaffold.cron_only` *is* somehow active (which is not intended in this test case), or some other authorization mechanism is blocking access, which is not expected in a default setup without IAP and without the decorator.

This test case demonstrates that without the `@securescaffold.cron_only` decorator, the `/vulnerable-cron` endpoint is publicly accessible and can be triggered by anyone, confirming the vulnerability.
