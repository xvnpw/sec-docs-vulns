### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Intentional Vulnerability Simulation Module Deployed in Non-Research Environment
* Description:
    1. A threat actor socially engineers a user into deploying the `kpwn` kernel module on a Linux system that is not intended for kernel security research. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques, such as disguising the module as a system performance enhancement or a security patch.
    2. Once the `kpwn` module is loaded into the kernel, it creates a device `/dev/kpwn` that allows users with read and write access to send commands via `ioctl`.
    3. These commands intentionally introduce vulnerabilities into the running kernel, such as arbitrary kernel memory read/write (`ARB_READ`, `ARB_WRITE`), arbitrary kernel memory free (`KFREE`), kernel address leaks (`KASLR_LEAK`, `SYM_ADDR`), and RIP control (`RIP_CONTROL`).
    4. An attacker can then use these intentionally introduced vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, bypass security measures, and gain complete control over the system. For example, using `ARB_WRITE` to overwrite kernel structures or `RIP_CONTROL` to hijack control flow.
* Impact:
    * Critical system compromise.
    * Full control of the affected Linux system by the attacker.
    * Potential data breach and exfiltration.
    * System instability and unpredictable behavior due to exploitation of kernel vulnerabilities.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The project documentation explicitly states that the `kpwn` module is for research purposes only and should not be deployed in production environments. This is mentioned in the main README.md file and the `third_party/kernel-modules/kpwn/README.md` file.
    * The disclaimer in the main README.md file also warns that this is not an officially supported Google product, implying users should use it at their own risk and for intended purposes.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Technical Prevention of Non-Research Deployment:** The project lacks technical controls to prevent the `kpwn` module from being loaded in non-research environments. For example, the module could include checks to prevent loading outside of a specifically configured research VM or container.
    * **Runtime Warnings:** The `kpwn` module could print a prominent warning message to the kernel logs and potentially to the system console upon loading, clearly stating that it is a vulnerability simulation module and should not be used in production.
    * **Restricted Device Permissions:** By default, the `/dev/kpwn` device could have very restricted permissions (e.g., root-only access) to limit the attack surface, even if the module is mistakenly loaded.  This would not prevent exploitation if the attacker gains root, but would prevent accidental or non-privileged abuse.
* Preconditions:
    * The threat actor must successfully socially engineer a user with sufficient privileges (typically root or sudo access) to load the `kpwn` kernel module.
    * The target system must be a Linux system.
    * The user must have access to the `kpwn` kernel module files and the ability to compile and load kernel modules (if not pre-compiled).
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided project files do not include the source code of the `kpwn` kernel module itself. However, the `third_party/kernel-modules/kpwn/README.md` file describes the functionality of the module and its commands.
    * Based on the README, the `kpwn` module, when loaded, registers a character device `/dev/kpwn`.
    * User-space programs can interact with this device by opening `/dev/kpwn` and sending `ioctl` commands.
    * The supported `ioctl` commands (ALLOC_BUFFER, KFREE, KASLR_LEAK, SYM_ADDR, WIN_TARGET, PRINTK, ARB_READ, ARB_WRITE, RIP_CONTROL) are explicitly designed to create security vulnerabilities.
        * `ALLOC_BUFFER`: Allows allocation of kernel memory, potentially with user-controlled size and content.
        * `KFREE`: Allows freeing of arbitrary kernel memory addresses, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities if misused.
        * `KASLR_LEAK`, `SYM_ADDR`: Intentionally leak kernel addresses, bypassing KASLR and making exploitation easier.
        * `ARB_READ`, `ARB_WRITE`: Enable arbitrary read and write to kernel memory, the most powerful primitives for kernel exploitation.
        * `RIP_CONTROL`: Allows direct control over the instruction pointer, enabling arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
        * `WIN_TARGET`:  A symbolic "win" function to easily test RIP control.
        * `PRINTK`: Allows logging arbitrary strings to kernel logs, useful for debugging and potentially for log injection.
    * The `test/kpwn_test.c` file and `kernel-image-runner/test/kpwn_test.sh` demonstrate how to use these `ioctl` commands, showcasing their intended vulnerability simulation capabilities.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Prepare a Linux virtual machine running a kernel compatible with the `kpwn` module (e.g., Ubuntu or kernelCTF release as mentioned in the documentation). Ensure the VM has network access to download the project files if needed, but the attack is assumed to be local after initial access is gained through social engineering.
    2. **Social Engineering (Simulated):** Assume the attacker has socially engineered the user to download the `kpwn` module files onto the VM. This step is outside the scope of direct code testing, but it's the primary attack vector.
    3. **Module Compilation and Loading:** On the VM, compile the `kpwn` kernel module using the provided `compile_custom_modules.sh` script or manually if needed. Load the compiled `kpwn.ko` module into the kernel using `insmod kpwn.ko` (requires root or sudo privileges).
    4. **Verify Device Creation:** Check if the `/dev/kpwn` device has been created using `ls -l /dev/kpwn`.
    5. **Exploit `ARB_WRITE` (Example):**
        * Compile the provided `test/kpwn_test.c` user-space program (or create a similar program) on the VM.
        * Modify `test/kpwn_test.c` to use the `SYM_ADDR` ioctl to get the address of a critical kernel symbol, for example `core_pattern`.
        * Modify `test/kpwn_test.c` to use the `ARB_WRITE` ioctl to overwrite the `core_pattern` kernel variable with a malicious command, such as `|/tmp/run_as_root`.  Ensure `/tmp/run_as_root` is a script that grants root privileges to a user (this script needs to be created in the VM separately).
        * Run the compiled `kpwn_test` program.
    6. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Trigger the execution of `core_pattern` by causing a program crash (e.g., by running `kill -SIGSEGV $$`).
    7. **Verify Impact:** Observe if the malicious command set in `core_pattern` is executed with root privileges. Check if the `/tmp/run_as_root` script was executed and if it successfully granted root privileges to a user, confirming arbitrary kernel write leading to privilege escalation.
    8. **Cleanup:** Unload the `kpwn` module using `rmmod kpwn`. Remove the malicious `/tmp/run_as_root` script and restore the original `core_pattern` if needed.
