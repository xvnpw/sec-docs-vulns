### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe YAML Deserialization leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    - The Avatar tool parses YAML configuration files, such as `config.yml`, to define test parameters and device configurations.
    - The tool utilizes the `mobly` library, specifically the `config_parser.load_test_config_file` function, to load and parse these YAML configuration files.
    - It is assumed that the `mobly` library's YAML parsing functionality employs an unsafe YAML loading method such as `yaml.load()` from the PyYAML library, without specifying `SafeLoader`. This is a common vulnerability pattern in Python applications parsing YAML.
    - An attacker can craft a malicious `config.yml` file containing YAML payloads that exploit this deserialization vulnerability. These payloads can embed Python code or commands within the YAML structure.
    - When the Avatar tool parses this malicious `config.yml` file using the vulnerable `yaml.load()` method (via `mobly`), the embedded code gets deserialized and executed by the Python interpreter.
    - This allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Python code on the system running the Avatar tool by simply providing a specially crafted YAML configuration file, potentially through the `-c` or `--config` command-line arguments.
- Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
    - This could lead to complete system compromise, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, malware installation, or further unauthorized access to the network.
    - Potential for lateral movement to other systems accessible from the compromised machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The application relies on the `mobly` library for YAML parsing, and there's no explicit mention or implementation of safe YAML loading practices within the Avatar project code. It's unclear if `mobly` itself implements any mitigations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Use `yaml.safe_load()`**: Replace any usage of `yaml.load()` with `yaml.safe_load()` when parsing YAML files, especially within the `mobly` library's `config_parser.load_test_config_file` function. `yaml.safe_load()` restricts the YAML parsing to a safer subset, preventing the deserialization of arbitrary Python objects and thus mitigating the code execution risk.
    - **Input Validation**: Implement validation of the configuration file content after loading and before usage to ensure that it conforms to the expected schema and data types. This can help detect and reject obviously malicious YAML files, although it's less effective against sophisticated deserialization attacks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the Avatar tool with minimal necessary privileges to limit the potential damage if code execution is achieved.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious `config.yml` file to the Avatar tool. This could occur if:
        - The attacker can modify the default configuration file used by Avatar.
        - The user can be tricked into using a malicious configuration file provided by the attacker, for example, by providing a path to a malicious file via the `-c` or `--config` command-line arguments.
        - Avatar processes configuration files from an external or untrusted source.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `avatar/runner.py`:
        - Function `add_config_file(self, path: pathlib.Path)` is responsible for adding configuration files to the test suite runner.
        - It calls `config_parser.load_test_config_file(str(path))` from the `mobly` library to load the configuration from the specified file path.
        ```python
        def add_config_file(self, path: pathlib.Path) -> None:
            self.test_run_configs += config_parser.load_test_config_file(str(path))  # type: ignore
        ```
    - `mobly/config_parser.py` (Source code not provided):
        - The vulnerability likely resides within the `load_test_config_file` function of the `mobly.config_parser` module.
        - **Assumption**: It is assumed that `load_test_config_file` uses an insecure method like `yaml.load()` from PyYAML (or a similar library) to parse the YAML configuration file.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        Avatar Runner (avatar/runner.py)
        └── add_config_file()
            └── config_parser.load_test_config_file()  (mobly/config_parser.py - POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY)
                └── YAML Parsing (Unsafe method like yaml.load())
                    └── Malicious YAML Payload --> Arbitrary Code Execution
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious `config.yml` file with a YAML payload that executes arbitrary code. For example, to execute the `id` command and redirect output to a file:
       ```yaml
       !!python/object/new:os.system
         args: ['id > /tmp/avatar_exploit.txt']
       TestBeds:
         - Name: malicious_testbed
           Controllers:
             BumbleDevice:
               - transport: 'tcp-client:127.0.0.1:6402'
       ```
    2. Save this file as `malicious_config.yml`.
    3. Open a terminal and navigate to the Avatar project directory.
    4. Execute the `host_test.py` script (or the main Avatar script), providing the path to the malicious configuration file using the `-c` flag:
       ```bash
       python cases/host_test.py -c malicious_config.yml --verbose
       ```
    5. After the script execution, check if the command injected in `malicious_config.yml` was executed. In this example, check if the file `/tmp/avatar_exploit.txt` exists and contains the output of the `id` command.
       ```bash
       ls -l /tmp/avatar_exploit.txt
       cat /tmp/avatar_exploit.txt
       ```
    6. If the file exists and contains the output of the `id` command, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved through the malicious `config.yml` file, demonstrating the vulnerability.
