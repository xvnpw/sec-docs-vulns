## Vulnerabilities List

### Building Configuration File Injection via ABEL Spreadsheet and Toolkit Bypass
- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious building configuration using the ABEL Spreadsheet template.
  2. The attacker exploits potential weaknesses in ABEL's spreadsheet validation, or limitations in the spreadsheet validation rules, to create a spreadsheet that, when converted, generates a building configuration file that bypasses instance validation.
  3. The attacker uses the Toolkit CLI or Web Application to process this maliciously crafted building configuration file, intending to onboard it into a building management system.
  4. The attacker relies on vulnerabilities in the Instance Validator, or the Toolkit's implementation of it, to allow the malicious building configuration file to pass validation despite containing harmful configurations.
  5. The attacker successfully onboards the malicious building configuration file into a building management system.
  6. The building management system, using the compromised configuration, applies incorrect or harmful settings to building equipment, potentially causing设备 malfunction or other physical consequences.
- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to incorrect or harmful configurations being applied to building management systems. This could result in:
    - 设备 malfunction (e.g., HVAC system failures, lighting control issues).
    - Disruption of building operations.
    - Potential safety hazards depending on the nature of the malicious configurations.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Instance Validator: The project includes an Instance Validator tool designed to validate building configuration files against the ontology and schema. This is intended to prevent invalid or malicious configurations from being used. The README.md mentions "**Instance Validator** validates a concrete application (instance) of DBO (i.e., a building configuration file) with optional telemetry validation." and "**Ontology Validator** validates the ontology upon a change or an extension (currently supports YAML format only)."
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Robust Spreadsheet Validation in ABEL: Deeper validation within ABEL itself to catch common spreadsheet-level attack vectors before converting to a building configuration file. This could include stricter input sanitization and more comprehensive checks beyond basic format validation.
  - Strengthened Instance Validator:  While Instance Validator exists, it might have vulnerabilities or limitations. Missing mitigations could include:
    - More rigorous validation rules to detect a wider range of malicious configurations.
    - Input sanitization and escaping within the Instance Validator to prevent injection attacks during processing.
    - Security audits and penetration testing of the Instance Validator to identify and address weaknesses.
  - Toolkit Security Hardening:
    - Secure invocation of the Instance Validator within the Toolkit to ensure validation is always performed and cannot be bypassed by a user.
    - Input validation and sanitization within the Toolkit CLI and Web Application to prevent malicious arguments or file uploads.
- **Preconditions:**
  1. Attacker must be able to craft a malicious building configuration spreadsheet.
  2. Attacker must have access to the ABEL toolchain (Spreadsheet template, ABEL tool, Toolkit CLI or Web Application).
  3. Building Management System must rely on the Digital Buildings schema and tools for configuration.
  4. Vulnerabilities must exist in ABEL spreadsheet validation or Toolkit instance validation that allow malicious configurations to pass undetected.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The provided code files (`findings_lib.py`, `state_lib.py`, `entity_type_manager.py`, `validate_types.py`, `config_folder_lib.py`, and test files) primarily focus on the structure and logic of the ontology and instance validation framework.
  - `findings_lib.py` defines the error reporting structure, which confirms the project's awareness of validation needs.
  - `state_lib.py`, `entity_type_manager.py`, and `config_folder_lib.py` outline the framework for managing and validating ontology components, indicating a structured approach to data validation.
  - `validate_types.py` shows the entry point for interactive validation, suggesting the validation tools are intended to be used directly.
  - Reviewing test files like `entity_type_lib_test.py`, `presubmit_validate_types_lib_test.py`, `namespace_validator_test.py`, `parse_config_lib_test.py`, and `state_lib_test.py` reveals a focus on validating the *structure* and *format* of the configuration files and ontology definitions. The tests cover cases like invalid names, duplicate definitions, incorrect file locations, and type mismatches. However, they do not explicitly include test cases focused on *malicious content injection* or *bypass attempts*.
  - `instance_validator.py` shows the main entry point for instance validation, taking filenames, subscription, timeout, and report directory as arguments. It calls `handler.RunValidation` to perform the actual validation.
  - `handler_test.py` and `telemetry_validator_test.py` are test files specifically for `instance_validator`, indicating testing efforts around instance validation and telemetry validation. However, similar to ontology validator tests, specific security-focused test cases for injection or bypass are not evident from the provided file names or contents alone.
  - Further deeper code review of `instance_validator/validate/*` and `code/tools/abel/validators/*` is needed to identify concrete injection vulnerabilities and potential bypasses in the validation logic.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
      - Set up a test environment with the Digital Buildings Toolkit CLI and ABEL toolchain installed.
      - Create a benign building configuration file (e.g., `benign_building_config.yaml`) using ABEL Spreadsheet and convert it to YAML.
  2. **Craft Malicious Spreadsheet:**
      - Open the ABEL Spreadsheet template.
      - In a text-based field (e.g., a string field within a component configuration), attempt to inject malicious content. Examples of malicious content could include:
        - YAML directives or tags that could be interpreted during YAML parsing in the Instance Validator (e.g., `!!python/object/new:os.system ['rm -rf /tmp/*']`).
        - Long strings or deeply nested structures designed to cause parsing or validation to consume excessive resources (though this is excluded as a DoS).
        - Values that are technically valid YAML but semantically incorrect or harmful for the building management system (e.g., extremely large or small numbers for setpoints, invalid GUIDs in critical fields, circular dependencies).
  3. **Convert to Building Configuration using ABEL:**
      - Use the ABEL tool to convert the malicious spreadsheet into a building configuration file (e.g., `malicious_building_config.yaml`).
  4. **Validate with Toolkit CLI:**
      - Use the Toolkit CLI with the Instance Validator (`toolkit.py -v -i malicious_building_config.yaml`) to validate the generated malicious building configuration file.
  5. **Analyze Validation Report:**
      - Examine the Instance Validator report (console output or report file). Check if the validator flags any errors or warnings related to the malicious configuration.
  6. **Expected Result:**
      - If the vulnerability exists, the Instance Validator should **not** flag the injected malicious content as a critical error. The validation might pass, or only show warnings unrelated to the malicious payload.
  7. **Impact Demonstration (Optional, if safe to perform):**
      - In a controlled test environment, attempt to load the `malicious_building_config.yaml` into a simplified or simulated building management system.
      - Monitor the system for any signs of unexpected behavior, errors, or misconfigurations resulting from the injected malicious content.

### YAML Parsing Vulnerability
- **Description:**
    An attacker can craft a malicious YAML building configuration file and submit it to the system. If the system uses a vulnerable YAML parser or does not properly validate the input against a schema, the attacker can exploit this to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server or disclose sensitive information.

    Steps to trigger:
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious YAML file. This file could include YAML directives or payloads that exploit known vulnerabilities in YAML parsers, such as:
        - **YAML tag deserialization vulnerabilities:**  Using tags like `!!python/object/new:__main__.MyClass` (for Python PyYAML) or similar constructs in other languages to instantiate arbitrary objects, potentially leading to code execution if the parser deserializes untrusted input.
        - **YAML aliases and anchors vulnerabilities:**  Crafting deeply nested or recursive structures using aliases and anchors that can cause excessive resource consumption or parser crashes, although the prompt excludes DoS, so focus should be on other impacts.
        - **Exploiting specific parser bugs:**  Leveraging known bugs in the specific YAML parser library being used by the system.
    2. Attacker submits this malicious YAML file to the system. The method of submission depends on how the system ingests building configuration files. It could be via:
        - Uploading the file through a web interface.
        - Providing a URL to the file.
        - Including the YAML content in an API request.
    3. The system parses the YAML file using a YAML parser library.
    4. If the parser is vulnerable and the system doesn't have sufficient input validation and sanitization, the malicious YAML payload is executed.
- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the system, install malware, steal data, or pivot to other internal systems.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read sensitive information from the server's file system, environment variables, or application memory. This could include configuration files, database credentials, API keys, source code, or user data.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** "Unknown, based on description it is missing."
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Schema Validation:** Implement strict schema validation for all YAML configuration files. Define a schema that specifies the expected structure and data types for building configurations. Validate incoming YAML files against this schema before parsing them. This can prevent unexpected data structures or malicious payloads from being processed.
    - **Secure YAML Parser Configuration:**  Configure the YAML parser to disable unsafe features like tag deserialization if they are not strictly necessary. Use safe loading modes provided by YAML parser libraries (e.g., `safe_load` in PyYAML).
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** If possible, parse YAML files in a sandboxed environment or isolated process with limited privileges to contain the impact of potential exploits.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Updates:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and dependencies, including the YAML parser library. Keep the YAML parser library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application and the process parsing YAML files are running with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must parse YAML configuration files.
    - The application must be accessible to the attacker (e.g., through a web interface, API, or other input mechanism that accepts YAML files).
    - The YAML parser library used by the application must be vulnerable to YAML parsing attacks or the application must not be using it securely.
    - There must be a lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the YAML configuration files.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```
    # Hypothetical code snippet - this is illustrative as no actual code is provided
    import yaml

    def process_config(yaml_file_path):
        with open(yaml_file_path, 'r') as f:
            config_data = yaml.load(f) # Potentially vulnerable yaml.load()

        # ... further processing of config_data ...
        return config_data

    # ... Application entry point ...
    config_file = get_config_file_from_user_input() # User input can control config file
    config = process_config(config_file)
    # ... use config data ...
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    1. The `process_config` function reads a YAML file from a provided path.
    2. It uses `yaml.load(f)` to parse the YAML content. **`yaml.load()` in PyYAML (and similar unsafe loading functions in other YAML libraries) is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the YAML input is attacker-controlled.** It can deserialize Python objects from YAML tags, leading to execution of arbitrary code embedded in the YAML.
    3. If the `get_config_file_from_user_input()` function allows an attacker to specify or upload a malicious YAML file, and this file path is passed to `process_config`, the attacker can control the content parsed by `yaml.load()`.
    4. By crafting a YAML file with a malicious payload (e.g., using `!!python/object/new` tag in PyYAML), the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when `yaml.load()` is called.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Attacker] --> B{Craft Malicious YAML File};
        B --> C[Application Entry Point];
        C --> D{get_config_file_from_user_input()};
        D --> E[process_config(yaml_file_path)];
        E --> F{yaml.load(f) - Vulnerable!};
        F --> G{Arbitrary Code Execution};
        G --> H[Server Compromised];
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    **Goal:** Verify if an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a malicious YAML file.

    **Assumptions:**
    - The application has a publicly accessible endpoint where a user can provide a YAML configuration file (e.g., file upload, URL input, API endpoint).
    - We assume the backend uses a vulnerable YAML parser like `yaml.load` in Python PyYAML or similar in other languages.
    - We will use a simple payload for demonstration, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory.

    **Steps:**
    1. **Craft a malicious YAML file (e.g., `malicious.yaml`) for Python PyYAML:**

       ```yaml
       !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
       ```

       **Note:** The specific payload may need to be adjusted based on the YAML parser library and the target environment. For other languages and libraries, you would use equivalent YAML payload for object instantiation or code execution.

    2. **Identify the application endpoint for providing YAML configuration.**  Let's assume it's a file upload field on a web page or an API endpoint that accepts YAML data.

    3. **Submit the malicious YAML file (`malicious.yaml`) to the application endpoint.**

    4. **Check for successful exploitation:**
       - **If successful code execution:** The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the server. You might need to gain some form of shell access or check application logs (if accessible) to confirm file creation or other indicators of code execution.
       - **Alternatively, if direct file system access is not possible**, try a payload that causes an observable effect, such as:
         - **Information Disclosure (if applicable):**  Try to read a known file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and see if the content is exposed in the application's response or logs (though this is less reliable for blind exploitation).
         - **Out-of-band interaction:**  Use a payload that triggers an external network request to a server you control (e.g., using `curl` or `wget` in `os.system`) to confirm code execution.

    5. **Analyze the results:**
       - If the `/tmp/pwned` file is created (or another indicator is observed), the vulnerability is confirmed.
       - If no indicator is observed, the application might be using a safe YAML loading method, have input validation, or the payload is not effective against the specific environment. Further investigation and payload adjustments might be needed.

    **Important:** Perform this test in a controlled environment and with explicit permission. Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems without authorization is illegal and unethical.
