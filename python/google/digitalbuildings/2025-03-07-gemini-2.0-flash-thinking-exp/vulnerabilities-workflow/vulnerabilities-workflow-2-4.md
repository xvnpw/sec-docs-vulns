Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you would like me to evaluate. I need the vulnerability list to be able to update it according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will go through each vulnerability and:

1. **Check if it is a valid vulnerability** related to the described attack vector of crafting malicious building configuration files for the Digital Buildings project.
2. **Evaluate against the exclusion criteria**:
    - Missing documentation only.
    - Denial of service.
    - Unrealistic exploit.
    - Incompletely described (missing source code analysis or security test case).
    - Theoretical only (missing exploit evidence in source code).
    - Not high or critical severity.

Based on these checks, I will either:

- Return an empty list in markdown format if no vulnerabilities meet the criteria.
- Return a markdown list of the vulnerabilities that meet the criteria, keeping their original descriptions.

**Looking forward to receiving the list of vulnerabilities so I can process it for you.**
