- Vulnerability Name: Building Configuration File Injection via ABEL Spreadsheet and Toolkit Bypass
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious building configuration using the ABEL Spreadsheet template.
  2. The attacker exploits potential weaknesses in ABEL's spreadsheet validation, or limitations in the spreadsheet validation rules, to create a spreadsheet that, when converted, generates a building configuration file that bypasses instance validation.
  3. The attacker uses the Toolkit CLI or Web Application to process this maliciously crafted building configuration file, intending to onboard it into a building management system.
  4. The attacker relies on vulnerabilities in the Instance Validator, or the Toolkit's implementation of it, to allow the malicious building configuration file to pass validation despite containing harmful configurations.
  5. The attacker successfully onboards the malicious building configuration file into a building management system.
  6. The building management system, using the compromised configuration, applies incorrect or harmful settings to building equipment, potentially causing设备 malfunction or other physical consequences.
- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to incorrect or harmful configurations being applied to building management systems. This could result in:
    - 设备 malfunction (e.g., HVAC system failures, lighting control issues).
    - Disruption of building operations.
    - Potential safety hazards depending on the nature of the malicious configurations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Instance Validator: The project includes an Instance Validator tool designed to validate building configuration files against the ontology and schema. This is intended to prevent invalid or malicious configurations from being used. The README.md mentions "**Instance Validator** validates a concrete application (instance) of DBO (i.e., a building configuration file) with optional telemetry validation." and "**Ontology Validator** validates the ontology upon a change or an extension (currently supports YAML format only)."
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Robust Spreadsheet Validation in ABEL: Deeper validation within ABEL itself to catch common spreadsheet-level attack vectors before converting to a building configuration file. This could include stricter input sanitization and more comprehensive checks beyond basic format validation.
  - Strengthened Instance Validator:  While Instance Validator exists, it might have vulnerabilities or limitations. Missing mitigations could include:
    - More rigorous validation rules to detect a wider range of malicious configurations.
    - Input sanitization and escaping within the Instance Validator to prevent injection attacks during processing.
    - Security audits and penetration testing of the Instance Validator to identify and address weaknesses.
  - Toolkit Security Hardening:
    - Secure invocation of the Instance Validator within the Toolkit to ensure validation is always performed and cannot be bypassed by a user.
    - Input validation and sanitization within the Toolkit CLI and Web Application to prevent malicious arguments or file uploads.
- Preconditions:
  1. Attacker must be able to craft a malicious building configuration spreadsheet.
  2. Attacker must have access to the ABEL toolchain (Spreadsheet template, ABEL tool, Toolkit CLI or Web Application).
  3. Building Management System must rely on the Digital Buildings schema and tools for configuration.
  4. Vulnerabilities must exist in ABEL spreadsheet validation or Toolkit instance validation that allow malicious configurations to pass undetected.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided code files (`findings_lib.py`, `state_lib.py`, `entity_type_manager.py`, `validate_types.py`, `config_folder_lib.py`, and test files) primarily focus on the structure and logic of the ontology and instance validation framework.
  - `findings_lib.py` defines the error reporting structure, which confirms the project's awareness of validation needs.
  - `state_lib.py`, `entity_type_manager.py`, and `config_folder_lib.py` outline the framework for managing and validating ontology components, indicating a structured approach to data validation.
  - `validate_types.py` shows the entry point for interactive validation, suggesting the validation tools are intended to be used directly.
  - Reviewing test files like `entity_type_lib_test.py`, `presubmit_validate_types_lib_test.py`, `namespace_validator_test.py`, `parse_config_lib_test.py`, and `state_lib_test.py` reveals a focus on validating the *structure* and *format* of the configuration files and ontology definitions. The tests cover cases like invalid names, duplicate definitions, incorrect file locations, and type mismatches. However, they do not explicitly include test cases focused on *malicious content injection* or *bypass attempts*.
  - `instance_validator.py` shows the main entry point for instance validation, taking filenames, subscription, timeout, and report directory as arguments. It calls `handler.RunValidation` to perform the actual validation.
  - `handler_test.py` and `telemetry_validator_test.py` are test files specifically for `instance_validator`, indicating testing efforts around instance validation and telemetry validation. However, similar to ontology validator tests, specific security-focused test cases for injection or bypass are not evident from the provided file names or contents alone.
  - Further deeper code review of `instance_validator/validate/*` and `code/tools/abel/validators/*` is needed to identify concrete injection vulnerabilities and potential bypasses in the validation logic.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
      - Set up a test environment with the Digital Buildings Toolkit CLI and ABEL toolchain installed.
      - Create a benign building configuration file (e.g., `benign_building_config.yaml`) using ABEL Spreadsheet and convert it to YAML.
  2. **Craft Malicious Spreadsheet:**
      - Open the ABEL Spreadsheet template.
      - In a text-based field (e.g., a string field within a component configuration), attempt to inject malicious content. Examples of malicious content could include:
        - YAML directives or tags that could be interpreted during YAML parsing in the Instance Validator (e.g., `!!python/object/new:os.system ['rm -rf /tmp/*']`).
        - Long strings or deeply nested structures designed to cause parsing or validation to consume excessive resources (though this is excluded as a DoS).
        - Values that are technically valid YAML but semantically incorrect or harmful for the building management system (e.g., extremely large or small numbers for setpoints, invalid GUIDs in critical fields, circular dependencies).
  3. **Convert to Building Configuration using ABEL:**
      - Use the ABEL tool to convert the malicious spreadsheet into a building configuration file (e.g., `malicious_building_config.yaml`).
  4. **Validate with Toolkit CLI:**
      - Use the Toolkit CLI with the Instance Validator (`toolkit.py -v -i malicious_building_config.yaml`) to validate the generated malicious building configuration file.
  5. **Analyze Validation Report:**
      - Examine the Instance Validator report (console output or report file). Check if the validator flags any errors or warnings related to the malicious configuration.
  6. **Expected Result:**
      - If the vulnerability exists, the Instance Validator should **not** flag the injected malicious content as a critical error. The validation might pass, or only show warnings unrelated to the malicious payload.
  7. **Impact Demonstration (Optional, if safe to perform):**
      - In a controlled test environment, attempt to load the `malicious_building_config.yaml` into a simplified or simulated building management system.
      - Monitor the system for any signs of unexpected behavior, errors, or misconfigurations resulting from the injected malicious content.
