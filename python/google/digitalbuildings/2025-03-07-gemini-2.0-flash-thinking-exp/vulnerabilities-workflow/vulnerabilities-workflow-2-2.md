- vulnerability name: YAML Parsing Vulnerability
  description: |
    An attacker can craft a malicious YAML building configuration file and submit it to the system. If the system uses a vulnerable YAML parser or does not properly validate the input against a schema, the attacker can exploit this to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server or disclose sensitive information.

    Steps to trigger:
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious YAML file. This file could include YAML directives or payloads that exploit known vulnerabilities in YAML parsers, such as:
        - **YAML tag deserialization vulnerabilities:**  Using tags like `!!python/object/new:__main__.MyClass` (for Python PyYAML) or similar constructs in other languages to instantiate arbitrary objects, potentially leading to code execution if the parser deserializes untrusted input.
        - **YAML aliases and anchors vulnerabilities:**  Crafting deeply nested or recursive structures using aliases and anchors that can cause excessive resource consumption or parser crashes, although the prompt excludes DoS, so focus should be on other impacts.
        - **Exploiting specific parser bugs:**  Leveraging known bugs in the specific YAML parser library being used by the system.
    2. Attacker submits this malicious YAML file to the system. The method of submission depends on how the system ingests building configuration files. It could be via:
        - Uploading the file through a web interface.
        - Providing a URL to the file.
        - Including the YAML content in an API request.
    3. The system parses the YAML file using a YAML parser library.
    4. If the parser is vulnerable and the system doesn't have sufficient input validation and sanitization, the malicious YAML payload is executed.
  impact: |
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the system, install malware, steal data, or pivot to other internal systems.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read sensitive information from the server's file system, environment variables, or application memory. This could include configuration files, database credentials, API keys, source code, or user data.
  vulnerability rank: critical
  currently implemented mitigations: "Unknown, based on description it is missing."
  missing mitigations: |
    - **Input Validation and Schema Validation:** Implement strict schema validation for all YAML configuration files. Define a schema that specifies the expected structure and data types for building configurations. Validate incoming YAML files against this schema before parsing them. This can prevent unexpected data structures or malicious payloads from being processed.
    - **Secure YAML Parser Configuration:**  Configure the YAML parser to disable unsafe features like tag deserialization if they are not strictly necessary. Use safe loading modes provided by YAML parser libraries (e.g., `safe_load` in PyYAML).
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** If possible, parse YAML files in a sandboxed environment or isolated process with limited privileges to contain the impact of potential exploits.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Updates:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and dependencies, including the YAML parser library. Keep the YAML parser library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application and the process parsing YAML files are running with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
  preconditions: |
    - The application must parse YAML configuration files.
    - The application must be accessible to the attacker (e.g., through a web interface, API, or other input mechanism that accepts YAML files).
    - The YAML parser library used by the application must be vulnerable to YAML parsing attacks or the application must not be using it securely.
    - There must be a lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the YAML configuration files.
  source code analysis: |
    ```
    # Hypothetical code snippet - this is illustrative as no actual code is provided
    import yaml

    def process_config(yaml_file_path):
        with open(yaml_file_path, 'r') as f:
            config_data = yaml.load(f) # Potentially vulnerable yaml.load()

        # ... further processing of config_data ...
        return config_data

    # ... Application entry point ...
    config_file = get_config_file_from_user_input() # User input can control config file
    config = process_config(config_file)
    # ... use config data ...
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    1. The `process_config` function reads a YAML file from a provided path.
    2. It uses `yaml.load(f)` to parse the YAML content. **`yaml.load()` in PyYAML (and similar unsafe loading functions in other YAML libraries) is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the YAML input is attacker-controlled.** It can deserialize Python objects from YAML tags, leading to execution of arbitrary code embedded in the YAML.
    3. If the `get_config_file_from_user_input()` function allows an attacker to specify or upload a malicious YAML file, and this file path is passed to `process_config`, the attacker can control the content parsed by `yaml.load()`.
    4. By crafting a YAML file with a malicious payload (e.g., using `!!python/object/new` tag in PyYAML), the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when `yaml.load()` is called.

  security test case: |
    **Goal:** Verify if an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a malicious YAML file.

    **Assumptions:**
    - The application has a publicly accessible endpoint where a user can provide a YAML configuration file (e.g., file upload, URL input, API endpoint).
    - We assume the backend uses a vulnerable YAML parser like `yaml.load` in Python PyYAML or similar in other languages.
    - We will use a simple payload for demonstration, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory.

    **Steps:**
    1. **Craft a malicious YAML file (e.g., `malicious.yaml`) for Python PyYAML:**

       ```yaml
       !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
       ```

       **Note:** The specific payload may need to be adjusted based on the YAML parser library and the target environment. For other languages and libraries, you would use equivalent YAML payload for object instantiation or code execution.

    2. **Identify the application endpoint for providing YAML configuration.**  Let's assume it's a file upload field on a web page or an API endpoint that accepts YAML data.

    3. **Submit the malicious YAML file (`malicious.yaml`) to the application endpoint.**

    4. **Check for successful exploitation:**
       - **If successful code execution:** The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the server. You might need to gain some form of shell access or check application logs (if accessible) to confirm file creation or other indicators of code execution.
       - **Alternatively, if direct file system access is not possible**, try a payload that causes an observable effect, such as:
         - **Information Disclosure (if applicable):**  Try to read a known file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and see if the content is exposed in the application's response or logs (though this is less reliable for blind exploitation).
         - **Out-of-band interaction:**  Use a payload that triggers an external network request to a server you control (e.g., using `curl` or `wget` in `os.system`) to confirm code execution.

    5. **Analyze the results:**
       - If the `/tmp/pwned` file is created (or another indicator is observed), the vulnerability is confirmed.
       - If no indicator is observed, the application might be using a safe YAML loading method, have input validation, or the payload is not effective against the specific environment. Further investigation and payload adjustments might be needed.

    **Important:** Perform this test in a controlled environment and with explicit permission. Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems without authorization is illegal and unethical.
