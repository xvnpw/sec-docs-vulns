## Vulnerabilities List

### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `me.text` and `me.markdown` components

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within a parameter intended for display using `me.text` or `me.markdown` components.
    2. A user clicks on the malicious URL, or the URL is otherwise executed in the context of the Mesop application (e.g., via iframe injection).
    3. The Mesop application, without proper sanitization, renders the user-provided input from the URL within the `me.text` or `me.markdown` component.
    4. The user's browser executes the embedded JavaScript payload, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

- **Impact:**
    - Account Takeover: An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other authentication tokens, leading to account compromise.
    - Data Theft: Sensitive information displayed within the application could be exfiltrated.
    - Malware Distribution: The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or serve malware.
    - Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the web page, potentially defacing the application's UI.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Mesop uses Angular framework, which has built-in sanitization, but based on the code, it's not consistently applied to user-provided input within component rendering context.
    - The `html` component has a `sanitized` mode which is enabled by default, indicating awareness of XSS risks, but this is not the default for `text` and `markdown` components.
    - Mesop uses Angular's built-in sanitization for the `markdown` component. However, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent XSS in all cases, particularly when developers might bypass it or when vulnerabilities exist within the sanitization library itself, or when novel XSS vectors are used that are not covered by the sanitizer.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of user-provided input within `me.text` and `me.markdown` components to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript code before rendering it in the UI.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): While CSP is mentioned in `docs/web-security.md`, it primarily focuses on iframe and script sources. CSP should be configured to further mitigate XSS by restricting the execution of inline scripts and styles, which could be injected via XSS. A stricter CSP could limit the capabilities of injected scripts.
    - Input Sanitization/Validation:  Mesop should provide clear guidelines and tools for developers to sanitize user inputs before embedding them in `markdown` components. This could include escaping user input or using a more robust HTML sanitizer and clearly documenting how to use it within Mesop applications.
    - Security Audits and Testing: Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be rendering user-controlled data using `me.text` or `me.markdown` components directly from URL parameters or other unsanitized sources.
    - The application must use the `markdown` component to render user-controlled content.
    - An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious markdown content into the application, for example, through URL parameters or form inputs that are then rendered by the markdown component.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. **Identify vulnerable components:** `mesop/components/text.py` and `mesop/components/markdown.py` are identified as potentially vulnerable because they render text content and might be used to display unsanitized user input.
    2. **Code Walkthrough for `me.text` and `me.markdown`:**
        - `mesop/components/text.py`: The `text` component in `mesop/components/text.py` directly renders the provided `text` argument. If this `text` argument originates from an unsanitized user input (e.g., URL parameter), it could be vulnerable to XSS.
        - `mesop/components/markdown.py`: The `markdown` component in `mesop/components/markdown.py` renders markdown text. While markdown itself is designed to be safe, vulnerabilities can arise if the markdown rendering library (likely Angular's in this case) does not properly sanitize HTML tags that might be embedded within the markdown, or if the input to markdown rendering is not correctly sanitized before being passed to the `markdown` component. Although the description mentions sanitization in `docs/web-security.md`, it's crucial to verify if this sanitization is sufficient and consistently applied, especially for `me.markdown`.
    3. **Documentation Review:**
        - File: `/code/docs/components/markdown.md`: The documentation for the `markdown` component does not explicitly mention any built-in XSS protection or sanitization. It states: "Markdown is used to render markdown text."
        - File: `/code/docs/guides/web-security.md`: This document mentions: "Mesop APIs do not allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the main execution context. For example, the [markdown](../components/markdown.md) component sanitizes the markdown content and removes active HTML content like JavaScript." This confirms sanitization is in place, but lacks detail about robustness and warnings about unsanitized user input.
    4. **Component Source Code Review:**
        - File: `/code/mesop/components/markdown.py`: The source code of the `markdown` component itself (/code/mesop/components/markdown.py) simply passes the text to the Angular frontend component without additional server-side sanitization. Sanitization is assumed to be in the Angular frontend.
    5. **Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability lies in the potential lack of sanitization when user-provided input is passed as the `text` argument to `me.text` or `me.markdown` components, allowing execution of malicious scripts within the user's browser.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a Mesop application instance with a page that uses `me.text` or `me.markdown` to display URL parameters, for example by modifying `/demo/text.py` or `/demo/markdown_demo.py` to read from `me.query_params`.
    2. **Craft Malicious URL:** Construct a URL to this page, appending a query parameter like `?xss=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. For example, if the Mesop app is running at `http://localhost:32123`, the malicious URL would be `http://localhost:32123/demo/text?xss=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    3. **Access Malicious URL:** Open the crafted URL in a web browser.
    4. **Verify XSS:** Observe if an alert box with "XSS" is displayed. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the JavaScript payload was executed, demonstrating a reflected XSS vulnerability.
    5. **Inspect Cookies (Optional):** To further verify the impact, use browser developer tools to check if JavaScript within the XSS payload can access and exfiltrate cookies or other sensitive information.
