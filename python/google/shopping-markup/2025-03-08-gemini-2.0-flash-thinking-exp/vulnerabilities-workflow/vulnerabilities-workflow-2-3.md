### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability name: Data Visualization Manipulation through Malicious Data Injection
* Description:
    1. An attacker gains control of a Google Merchant Center or Google Ads account that is connected as a data source to the MarkUp project. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or by gaining unauthorized access to these accounts.
    2. The attacker injects malicious or misleading data into the Google Merchant Center or Google Ads account. This could involve modifying product feeds in GMC or campaign settings in Google Ads to include fabricated performance metrics, altered product attributes, or fake issue reports.
    3. The MarkUp project automatically transfers data from the compromised GMC and Google Ads accounts to BigQuery datasets using scheduled data transfer services configured during the setup.
    4. The MarkUp scripts and SQL queries process this transferred data without proper validation or sanitization, incorporating the attacker's injected malicious data into the materialized views and tables within BigQuery.
    5. Users then access the Data Studio dashboards, which are connected to these BigQuery views and tables. The dashboards visualize the manipulated data, leading users to see misleading insights about their Google Merchant Center and Google Ads performance.
* Impact:
    * **Misleading Business Decisions:** Users relying on the dashboards will make decisions based on incorrect or fabricated data, potentially leading to ineffective or harmful business strategies. For example, a retailer might falsely believe a product is performing well or that their feed health is optimal, based on manipulated dashboard insights.
    * **Reputational Damage:** If incorrect data leads to poor business outcomes, it can damage the reputation of the user's business.
    * **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the MarkUp tool and the data it presents, hindering its adoption and effectiveness within the organization.
* Vulnerability rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The project focuses on data processing and visualization, assuming the input data from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads is trustworthy. There is no input validation or sanitization implemented in the provided code to handle potentially malicious data from the source accounts.
* Missing mitigations:
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of data ingested from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads before it is processed and visualized. This could include:
        * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that data fields conform to expected data types (e.g., numeric fields are actually numbers, date fields are valid dates).
        * **Range Checks:** Verify that numeric values fall within reasonable ranges.
        * **String Sanitization:** Sanitize string inputs to prevent injection of malicious code or control characters that could be misinterpreted in dashboards or downstream systems (though SQL injection in application is not directly evident, preventing unexpected characters is good practice).
    * **Data Source Authentication and Authorization:** While the setup script configures data transfers, it doesn't include mechanisms to continuously monitor or verify the integrity and security of the connected Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts. Stronger emphasis on secure account management and alerting on suspicious data changes in source accounts would be beneficial.
    * **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns in the ingested data that might indicate data manipulation attempts. This could involve setting up alerts for unusual data fluctuations or discrepancies compared to historical data.
* Preconditions:
    * Attacker gains unauthorized access to a Google Merchant Center or Google Ads account that is configured as a data source for the MarkUp project.
    * The MarkUp project is successfully set up and running, with data transfers configured to pull data from the attacker-controlled GMC or Google Ads account.
* Source code analysis:
    * The code primarily focuses on setting up data pipelines and creating BigQuery views and tables based on data transferred from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.
    * Files like `cloud_data_transfer.py` and `cloud_bigquery.py` handle the data transfer and processing logic.
    * SQL scripts in the `scripts` directory (e.g., `materialize_product_detailed.sql`, `materialize_product_historical.sql`) define the transformations and aggregations performed on the data.
    * **Absence of Validation:**  A review of the provided code, especially the Python scripts and SQL queries, reveals a lack of input validation or sanitization. The scripts assume that the data retrieved from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads is inherently trustworthy and accurate.
    * **Data Flow:** The data flows from GMC/Google Ads -> BigQuery Data Transfer Service -> BigQuery datasets (managed by MarkUp) -> Data Studio dashboards. The vulnerability lies in the lack of checks at the point where data enters the BigQuery datasets. Malicious data injected at the GMC/Google Ads source is directly propagated through the pipeline to the dashboards.
    * **Example - `cloud_bigquery.py` and SQL scripts:** The `cloud_bigquery.py` file contains functions to execute SQL queries. The `execute_queries` function reads SQL files and executes them. These SQL queries, while not dynamically built in a way that's vulnerable to SQL injection in the application itself, operate on the data pulled directly from GMC/Google Ads. If this source data is malicious, the queries will process and propagate the malicious data without question. For example, if a product title in GMC is changed to a very long string or contains special characters intended to disrupt dashboard rendering or calculations, the SQL queries won't prevent this from being reflected in the final dashboards.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup MarkUp:** Install and configure the MarkUp project, connecting it to your Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts. Ensure data transfers are running successfully and dashboards are displaying data.
    2. **Compromise Source Account (Simulated):** For testing purposes, simulate a compromised Google Merchant Center account by gaining access to a test GMC account. Alternatively, if testing against Google Ads data, use a test Google Ads account.
    3. **Inject Malicious Data in GMC:** In the test Google Merchant Center account, manually modify product data to inject malicious or misleading information. Examples:
        * Change a product title to an extremely long string (e.g., thousands of characters).
        * Modify a product price to an unrealistic value (e.g., $99999999).
        * Alter product attributes to include special characters or control characters that might cause issues in data processing or visualization.
    4. **Wait for Data Transfer:** Allow sufficient time for the scheduled data transfer jobs to run and propagate the modified data from the test GMC account to the BigQuery datasets used by MarkUp. This might take up to 24 hours based on the documentation.
    5. **Observe Data Studio Dashboards:** Access the Data Studio dashboards created by MarkUp. Examine the dashboards to see if the injected malicious data is reflected in the visualizations. Look for:
        * **Visual Anomalies:** Are there charts or tables that are rendering incorrectly or displaying unexpected values due to the injected data (e.g., broken charts, unusually large numbers, garbled text)?
        * **Misleading Insights:** Does the injected data cause the dashboards to present false or misleading insights about product performance, feed health, or advertising metrics? For example, does a fake high price skew average price calculations?
    6. **Verify in BigQuery:**  If the dashboard visualization is affected, further verify by directly querying the BigQuery tables (`product_detailed_materialized`, `product_historical_materialized`, etc.) to confirm that the malicious data from GMC is indeed present in the processed data within BigQuery.
    7. **Document Findings:** Document the observed anomalies in the Data Studio dashboards and the presence of malicious data in BigQuery, demonstrating the vulnerability of data visualization manipulation through malicious data injection in source systems.
