### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure through Publicly Shared Data Studio Dashboards
  - Description:
    1. A user installs MarkUp, which automates the setup of data transfers from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads to BigQuery.
    2. The user creates Data Studio dashboards using the provided templates, connecting them to the BigQuery datasets created by MarkUp. These dashboards are designed to visualize sensitive Google Merchant Center and Google Ads performance data.
    3. The user misconfigures the sharing settings of a Data Studio dashboard, unintentionally or intentionally setting the visibility to "Public on the web". This makes the dashboard accessible to anyone with the link, without requiring authentication.
    4. An attacker discovers the public link to the misconfigured Data Studio dashboard. This could happen through various means, such as search engine indexing if the link is accidentally posted online, or if the link is shared insecurely.
    5. The attacker accesses the dashboard using the public link. As the dashboard is publicly accessible, the attacker can view sensitive Google Merchant Center and Google Ads performance data without needing any credentials or authorization.
  - Impact:
    Exposure of sensitive business data related to Google Merchant Center and Google Ads performance. This data could include metrics on product performance, advertising costs, revenue, and potentially competitive insights. Disclosure of this information can lead to:
      - Competitive disadvantage: Competitors could gain insights into the retailer's product strategy, advertising performance, and overall business health.
      - Loss of customer trust: If the disclosed data includes customer-related information (even in aggregate form), it could erode customer trust.
      - Regulatory compliance issues: Depending on the nature of the disclosed data and applicable regulations (like GDPR, CCPA), the retailer might face legal repercussions for data breaches.
      - Financial loss: Misuse of disclosed performance data could lead to ineffective business decisions or direct financial losses.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Deprecation Notice: The project README.md clearly states "This tool is deprecated". While not a direct technical mitigation, this discourages new users from adopting the tool, reducing the potential attack surface. However, existing users might still be vulnerable. This is a weak mitigation as it relies on users noticing the deprecation and understanding the security implications.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Security Warning Documentation: The project lacks explicit documentation warning users about the critical importance of properly configuring Data Studio dashboard sharing settings. This documentation should clearly outline the risks of public sharing and provide step-by-step instructions on how to securely share dashboards (e.g., sharing with specific users or Google Groups, utilizing Data Studio's access control features).
    - Best Practices Guide:  A guide on data anonymization or aggregation techniques suitable for dashboards intended for broader sharing would be beneficial. This could help users understand how to present data in a less sensitive manner if public sharing is necessary for their use case.
    - In-Template Security Reminders:  While technically challenging to enforce within the MarkUp code itself, the Data Studio dashboard templates could be modified (if template functionality allows) to include a prominent initial reminder about checking and securing the sharing settings immediately upon creation.
  - Preconditions:
    - Successful MarkUp Installation: The user must have successfully installed and configured MarkUp, including setting up the data transfers and BigQuery datasets.
    - Data Studio Dashboard Creation: The user must have created Data Studio dashboards from the provided templates, linking them to their BigQuery data.
    - Dashboard Sharing Misconfiguration: The user must have misconfigured the sharing settings of at least one Data Studio dashboard, setting it to "Public on the web".
    - Link Discovery: An attacker must discover the public URL of the misconfigured Data Studio dashboard.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided source code primarily focuses on automating the deployment of cloud resources and data pipelines. It does not directly manage or enforce security settings on Data Studio dashboards, as dashboard sharing configurations are handled within the Data Studio platform itself, outside of the MarkUp project's codebase.
    - `README.md`: The file provides links to Data Studio templates. These templates, while simplifying dashboard creation, indirectly contribute to the attack vector because they are the starting point for users creating dashboards that they might then misconfigure. The deprecation notice in the README is the closest element to a mitigation in the codebase, but it's not a technical control.
    - `setup.sh`, `cloud_env_setup.py`, `cloud_data_transfer.py`, `cloud_bigquery.py`, `config.yaml`, `config_parser.py`, `auth.py`, `plugins/cloud_utils/*`: These files are involved in setting up the data infrastructure. They are essential for the tool's functionality but do not directly introduce or mitigate the information disclosure vulnerability related to Data Studio sharing. The vulnerability is a misconfiguration issue in Data Studio, external to the provided codebase. The code's role is to *enable* the data visualization that becomes vulnerable when sharing is mismanaged.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy MarkUp in a controlled GCP project. Connect it to test Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts containing non-sensitive, representative data.
    2. **Dashboard Creation:** Create Data Studio dashboards using the "Markup Dashboard Template" and/or "Merchant Market Insights Dashboard Template" as provided in the `README.md`. Ensure the dashboards are correctly connected to the BigQuery datasets created during MarkUp installation.
    3. **Sharing Misconfiguration:** For one of the created dashboards, intentionally change the sharing settings to "Public on the web". Obtain the publicly accessible URL of this dashboard.
    4. **Attacker Access Simulation:** Open a new browser session (or use incognito mode or a different browser profile) where you are not logged into the GCP project or any Google account associated with the MarkUp setup.
    5. **Verification:** In this attacker browser session, navigate to the public URL of the Data Studio dashboard obtained in step 3.
    6. **Observe Data Access:** Verify that you can successfully access and view the dashboard and its data visualizations without any login or authentication prompts. Confirm that the dashboard displays data originating from the test Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts, thus demonstrating information disclosure.
    7. **Remediation Test (Documentation - if created):** If documentation with security warnings and secure sharing instructions were created as a mitigation, test following these instructions to securely share a dashboard with restricted access (e.g., only with specific test user accounts) and verify that the "Public on the web" link is no longer functional or does not expose sensitive data.
