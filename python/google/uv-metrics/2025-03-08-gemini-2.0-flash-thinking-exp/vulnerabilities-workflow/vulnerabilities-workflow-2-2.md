### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage Backend Configuration
- Description:
    1. The `uv-metrics` library allows users to configure various storage backends for storing machine learning metrics, including MLflow, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), SQLite, and others.
    2. If users insecurely configure these storage backends, for example, by using publicly accessible cloud storage buckets without proper access controls, or by using default credentials, sensitive information contained within the reported machine learning metrics can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    3. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to these insecurely configured storage backends.
    4. By accessing the storage backend, the attacker can retrieve and analyze the stored machine learning metrics.
    5. These metrics might inadvertently contain sensitive information, such as model performance on sensitive datasets, dataset distributions, or even raw data samples if logged as metrics.
    6. This vulnerability is not within the `uv-metrics` library code itself, but rather arises from the user's configuration of the storage backend used with the library. However, the library does not provide sufficient guidance or safeguards against such insecure configurations.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive information potentially included in machine learning metrics.
    - Exposure of proprietary machine learning model performance data.
    - Leakage of sensitive dataset characteristics or even raw data if included in metrics.
    - Reputational damage and potential compliance violations due to data breaches.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any mitigations against insecure storage backend configurations. The security relies entirely on the user's responsibility to configure the storage backend securely.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation should be added to explicitly warn users about the risks of insecurely configuring storage backends.
    - Best practices and recommendations for secure configuration of each supported storage backend (MLflow, GCS, SQLite, etc.) should be provided in the documentation.
    - Consider adding warnings or checks within the library to detect potentially insecure configurations (e.g., detecting if GCS bucket is publicly readable, if possible). However, this might be complex and could lead to false positives or negatives. A strong focus on documentation and user education is more practical.
    - Security test cases should be added to demonstrate the vulnerability and the importance of secure backend configuration.
- Preconditions:
    - A user of the `uv-metrics` library configures it to report metrics to a storage backend.
    - The storage backend (e.g., MLflow tracking server, GCS bucket, SQLite database location) is insecurely configured, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The code itself does not introduce the vulnerability, but it facilitates the use of external storage backends without providing security guidance.
    - Files like `/code/tutorials/mlflow/tutorial.py`, `/code/tutorials/mlflow_queries/tutorial.py`, and `/code/uv/reporter/state.py` demonstrate how to configure and use different storage backends (MLflow, local filesystem, GCS via artifact location in MLflow).
    - In `/code/uv/reporter/state.py`, the `start_run` function handles MLflow setup and artifact location, but there is no security enforcement or warning related to backend configuration.
    - The code assumes that the user will configure the storage backend securely and does not include any checks or safeguards against insecure setups.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Insecure GCS Bucket:** Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket and configure it to be publicly readable (or accessible with easily guessable or default credentials, if applicable to other backend types).
    2. **Configure uv-metrics to use Insecure Backend:** Modify a tutorial script (e.g., `/code/tutorials/mlflow/tutorial.py`) to use the MLFlowReporter and configure the MLflow artifact location to point to the publicly readable GCS bucket created in step 1. For example, set `artifact_location='gs://your-publicly-readable-bucket/uv-metrics-test-runs'`.
    3. **Run the Instrumented Code:** Execute the modified tutorial script to report metrics to the insecure GCS bucket.
    4. **Simulate External Attacker Access:** As an external attacker, use the `gsutil` command-line tool or the Google Cloud Console to list the contents of the publicly readable GCS bucket ( `gsutil ls gs://your-publicly-readable-bucket/uv-metrics-test-runs`).
    5. **Verify Unauthorized Access:** Confirm that the attacker can successfully list the files in the bucket, which contain the reported metrics.
    6. **Download and Inspect Metrics:** Download one or more metric files from the bucket (e.g., using `gsutil cp gs://your-publicly-readable-bucket/uv-metrics-test-runs/<run_id>/artifacts/metrics/* .`) and inspect their contents to verify that the attacker can access the reported metrics data.
    7. **Cleanup:** Delete the publicly readable GCS bucket and any created resources after the test.
