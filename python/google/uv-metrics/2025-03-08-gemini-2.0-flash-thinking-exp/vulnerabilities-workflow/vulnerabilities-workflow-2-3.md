### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Metric Key Injection via Unsanitized Input in LoggingReporter
* Description:
    1. An attacker can control the metric key reported to `LoggingReporter`.
    2. If the logging destination is vulnerable to control characters or format string vulnerabilities, the attacker can inject arbitrary content into the logs.
    3. While `LoggingReporter` is designed for simple text output, if logs are processed by an external system that interprets control characters or format strings, this could lead to log injection.
* Impact:
    - Log injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary content into the logs, potentially leading to:
        - Log manipulation: Hiding malicious activities or injecting false information.
        - Log poisoning: Making logs unreliable for auditing and security monitoring.
        - In systems that automatically process logs, this could lead to further exploitation depending on how logs are processed.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `LoggingReporter` directly prints the metric key without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for metric keys in `LoggingReporter` to remove or escape control characters and format string specifiers.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the metric keys reported to `LoggingReporter`. This is typically achievable if the attacker can influence the machine learning workflow being instrumented by `uv-metrics`.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/uv/reporter/store.py`
    2. Class: `LoggingReporter`
    3. Method: `report_all`
    4. Line: `print("Step {}: {}".format(step, s), file=f)`
    5. The code iterates through the metrics dictionary `m` and formats a string `s` using f-string like formatting.
    6. The metric keys `k` from the dictionary `m` are directly embedded into the log message without any sanitization.
    7. If a malicious user can control the keys in the `m` dictionary and inject format string specifiers or control characters, these characters will be directly written to the log file.

    ```python
    def report_all(self, step: int, m: Dict[t.MetricKey, t.Metric]) -> None:
        s = ", ".join(["{} = {}".format(k, self._format(v)) for k, v in m.items()]) # Vulnerable line: k is directly used in format string
        f = self._file
        print("Step {}: {}".format(step, s), file=f)
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a `LoggingReporter` instance that logs to a dummy file.
    2. Construct a metric dictionary where one of the keys contains a format string specifier, e.g., `{"metric_name": 1, "%s%s%s%s%s": 2}`.
    3. Report this dictionary using `report_all`.
    4. Examine the log output and observe if the format string specifier is interpreted or printed literally. If interpreted, it indicates a vulnerability. In a real-world scenario, crafted keys could inject malicious commands if logs are processed automatically.

    ```python
    import uv.reporter.store as rs
    import tests.uv.util.test_init as ti

    mem = ti.MemFile()
    reporter = rs.LoggingReporter(file=mem)

    malicious_key = "%s%s%s%s%s"
    metrics_data = {
        "benign_metric": 1.0,
        malicious_key: "malicious_value"
    }

    reporter.report_all(0, metrics_data)

    log_output = "".join(mem.items())
    print(log_output)

    # Expected vulnerable output (format string might be interpreted, depends on python version and logging system):
    # Step 0: benign_metric = 1.000, %s%s%s%s%s = malicious_value
    #
    # Expected mitigated output (format string is escaped or sanitized):
    # Step 0: benign_metric = 1.000, %s%s%s%s%s = malicious_value
    # or
    # Step 0: benign_metric = 1.000, [sanitized_%s%s%s%s%s] = malicious_value
    ```
