### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: LaTeX Injection via Unsanitized String Literals
- Description:
    1. An attacker provides a Python function as input to `latexify_py`.
    2. This Python function contains a string literal crafted to include malicious LaTeX commands.
    3. `latexify_py`'s code generation process directly incorporates this string literal into the generated LaTeX output without proper sanitization or escaping of LaTeX-specific control characters.
    4. When the generated LaTeX code is rendered by a LaTeX engine, the malicious commands within the string literal are executed, leading to potential security vulnerabilities depending on the LaTeX rendering environment.
- Impact:
    - **High**: If the generated LaTeX is processed by a vulnerable LaTeX rendering engine (e.g., in a web application using user-provided code to generate LaTeX), this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client-side, or other forms of malicious actions, such as arbitrary file access or information disclosure, depending on the capabilities of the LaTeX engine and the context in which it is used.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not implement any explicit sanitization or escaping for string literals to prevent LaTeX injection.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement sanitization of string literals to escape LaTeX special characters and commands that could be exploited for injection. This should include escaping characters like backslashes, curly braces, dollar signs, percent signs, underscores, carets, hash symbols, ampersands, tildes, and vertical bars.
- Preconditions:
    - The `latexify_py` library is used to process user-provided Python code.
    - The generated LaTeX output is rendered by a LaTeX engine that is susceptible to command injection or other LaTeX-specific vulnerabilities.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `src/latexify/codegen/expression_codegen.py`**
    2. **Method: `visit_Constant(self, node: ast.Constant) -> str`**
    ```python
    def visit_Constant(self, node: ast.Constant) -> str:
        """Visit a Constant node."""
        return codegen_utils.convert_constant(node.value)
    ```
    3. **File: `src/latexify/codegen/codegen_utils.py`**
    4. **Method: `convert_constant(value: Any) -> str`**
    ```python
    def convert_constant(value: Any) -> str:
        """Helper to convert constant values to LaTeX.
        ...
        """
        ...
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return r'\textrm{"' + value + '"}'
        ...
    ```
    5. The `convert_constant` function handles string constants by wrapping them in `\textrm{""}`. However, it does **not escape** any LaTeX special characters or commands that might be present *within* the string `value` itself.
    6. If a user provides a string like `"Hello \敏感指令 World!"`, the generated LaTeX will be `\textrm{"Hello \敏感指令 World!"}`. If `\敏感指令` is a malicious LaTeX command, it will be directly passed to the LaTeX engine for rendering.
    7. **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Python code) --> parser.py (AST) --> expression_codegen.py (visit_Constant) --> codegen_utils.py (convert_constant - NO SANITIZATION) --> LaTeX output (VULNERABLE) --> LaTeX Engine (Exploit!)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Python function with a string literal containing a malicious LaTeX command, for example, to write to a file (if the LaTeX engine and environment allow file operations, example uses `\write18` which is often disabled for security reasons, a less dangerous but still demonstrative command is used for this test):
    ```python
    import latexify

    @latexify.function
    def vulnerable_function(user_input):
        return user_input + " malicious latex: $\\documentclass{article}\\begin{document}Malicious Content\\end{document}$"

    print(vulnerable_function("Hello"))
    ```
    2. Execute this Python code and observe the generated LaTeX output.
    3. The generated LaTeX output will contain the injected LaTeX commands directly within the `\textrm{}` environment.
    4. If you were to render this LaTeX code (for example, using an online LaTeX editor or a local LaTeX installation if `\documentclass{article}\begin{document}Malicious Content\\end{document}` is replaced with a less harmful command for demonstration purposes like `\textit{Injected}`), you would see that the injected LaTeX commands are interpreted and executed by the LaTeX engine. In a real-world scenario with a more potent malicious payload and a vulnerable LaTeX processor, this could lead to serious security breaches.
    5. For a safer demonstration, use a less harmful injection such as:
    ```python
    import latexify

    @latexify.function
    def vulnerable_function(user_input):
        return user_input + " Injected: $\\textit{This is injected text.}$"

    print(vulnerable_function("Hello"))
    ```
    6. Run this modified test case and verify that the output LaTeX contains `\textit{This is injected text.}` within the string, and rendering this LaTeX will indeed italicize "This is injected text." within the output, proving the injection is successful. This demonstrates the lack of sanitization and the potential for more harmful injections.
