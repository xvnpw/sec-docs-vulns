### LaTeX Injection via Unsanitized String Literals

- **Vulnerability Name:** LaTeX Injection via Unsanitized String Literals
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker provides a Python function as input to `latexify_py`.
    2. This Python function contains a string literal crafted to include malicious LaTeX commands.
    3. `latexify_py`'s code generation process directly incorporates this string literal into the generated LaTeX output without proper sanitization or escaping of LaTeX-specific control characters.
    4. When the generated LaTeX code is rendered by a LaTeX engine, the malicious commands within the string literal are executed, leading to potential security vulnerabilities depending on the LaTeX rendering environment.
- **Impact:**
    - **High**: If the generated LaTeX is processed by a vulnerable LaTeX rendering engine, this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client-side, or other forms of malicious actions, such as arbitrary file access or information disclosure, depending on the capabilities of the LaTeX engine and the context in which it is used.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The code does not implement any explicit sanitization or escaping for string literals to prevent LaTeX injection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: Implement sanitization of string literals to escape LaTeX special characters and commands that could be exploited for injection. This should include escaping characters like backslashes, curly braces, dollar signs, percent signs, underscores, carets, hash symbols, ampersands, tildes, and vertical bars.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The `latexify_py` library is used to process user-provided Python code.
    - The generated LaTeX output is rendered by a LaTeX engine that is susceptible to command injection or other LaTeX-specific vulnerabilities.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `src/latexify/codegen/expression_codegen.py`**
    2. **Method: `visit_Constant(self, node: ast.Constant) -> str`**
    ```python
    def visit_Constant(self, node: ast.Constant) -> str:
        """Visit a Constant node."""
        return codegen_utils.convert_constant(node.value)
    ```
    3. **File: `src/latexify/codegen/codegen_utils.py`**
    4. **Method: `convert_constant(value: Any) -> str`**
    ```python
    def convert_constant(value: Any) -> str:
        """Helper to convert constant values to LaTeX.
        ...
        """
        ...
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return r'\textrm{"' + value + '"}'
        ...
    ```
    5. The `convert_constant` function handles string constants by wrapping them in `\textrm{""}`. However, it does **not escape** any LaTeX special characters or commands that might be present *within* the string `value` itself.
    6. If a user provides a string like `"Hello \敏感指令 World!"`, the generated LaTeX will be `\textrm{"Hello \敏感指令 World!"}`. If `\敏感指令` is a malicious LaTeX command, it will be directly passed to the LaTeX engine for rendering.
    7. **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Python code) --> parser.py (AST) --> expression_codegen.py (visit_Constant) --> codegen_utils.py (convert_constant - NO SANITIZATION) --> LaTeX output (VULNERABLE) --> LaTeX Engine (Exploit!)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a Python function with a string literal containing a malicious LaTeX command:
    ```python
    import latexify

    @latexify.function
    def vulnerable_function(user_input):
        return user_input + " malicious latex: $\\documentclass{article}\\begin{document}Malicious Content\\end{document}$"

    print(vulnerable_function("Hello"))
    ```
    2. Execute this Python code and observe the generated LaTeX output.
    3. The generated LaTeX output will contain the injected LaTeX commands directly within the `\textrm{}` environment.
    4. Render this LaTeX code using a LaTeX engine. In a real-world scenario with a more potent malicious payload and a vulnerable LaTeX processor, this could lead to serious security breaches. For a safer demonstration, use a less harmful injection such as:
    ```python
    import latexify

    @latexify.function
    def vulnerable_function(user_input):
        return user_input + " Injected: $\\textit{This is injected text.}$"

    print(vulnerable_function("Hello"))
    ```
    5. Run this modified test case and verify that the output LaTeX contains `\textit{This is injected text.}` within the string, and rendering this LaTeX will indeed italicize "This is injected text." within the output, proving the injection is successful. This demonstrates the lack of sanitization and the potential for more harmful injections.

### LaTeX Injection via Identifier Names

- **Vulnerability Name:** LaTeX Injection via Identifier Names
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a Python function where identifier names (function name, argument names, variable names) are chosen to represent malicious LaTeX commands.
    2. The `latexify_py` library processes this Python code, converting these identifier names directly into LaTeX without sufficient sanitization.
    3. When the generated LaTeX code is rendered by a LaTeX engine, the injected malicious commands are executed.
    4. For example, an attacker could define a function with a name like `\documentclass{article}\begin{document}Malicious Content\end{document}`. When `latexify_py` processes this, it might directly embed this function name into the LaTeX output, leading to the injection.
- **Impact:**
    If a system uses `latexify_py` to generate LaTeX from user-provided Python code and then automatically processes this LaTeX, a successful injection could lead to:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the LaTeX engine is configured to allow external commands, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the server's file system.
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the LaTeX engine can make network requests, an attacker might be able to probe internal services or external websites.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project uses `escape_underscores=True` by default in `Config.defaults()`. When `escape_underscores=True`, underscores in identifiers are escaped, which might prevent some basic injection attempts that rely on underscores for subscripts, but it does not prevent injection through other LaTeX commands in identifiers when `escape_underscores=False`.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Identifier Name Sanitization:** Implement a strict validation or sanitization process for all identifier names extracted from the Python code before converting them to LaTeX. This could involve:
        - **Allowlisting:** Only allow a predefined set of safe characters for identifiers and reject any names containing LaTeX special characters or command sequences.
        - **Escaping Special Characters:** Escape all LaTeX special characters (`{`, `}`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `#`, `_`, `^`, `\`, `~`) in identifiers or remove them entirely.
        - **Command Name Blacklisting:** Maintain a blacklist of known malicious LaTeX commands or command prefixes and reject identifiers that match these patterns.
    - **Output Encoding**: While underscores are escaped when `escape_underscores=True`, this is insufficient. All LaTeX special characters and commands within identifiers should be systematically escaped or removed to ensure safe LaTeX output, or identifiers should be validated against a strict whitelist.
    - **Sandboxing LaTeX Processing:** Ensure that the LaTeX engine is run in a heavily sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to prevent command execution and limit the impact of potential injections.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. `latexify_py` library is used to convert Python code to LaTeX.
    2. User-provided Python code or code influenced by user input is processed by `latexify_py`.
    3. The generated LaTeX output is automatically processed by a LaTeX engine without manual review and in an environment where command execution or information disclosure is possible if malicious LaTeX is injected.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/latexify/codegen/identifier_converter.py`:** The `IdentifierConverter.convert()` method performs a basic conversion:
        ```python
        def convert(self, name: str) -> tuple[str, bool]:
            ...
            if self._use_math_symbols and name in expression_rules.MATH_SYMBOLS:
                return "\\" + name, True

            if len(name) == 1 and name != "_":
                return name, True

            escaped = name.replace("_", r"\_") if self._escape_underscores else name
            wrapped = rf"\mathrm{{{escaped}}}" if self._use_mathrm else escaped

            return wrapped, False
        ```
        It escapes underscores (if `self._escape_underscores` is True) but does **not** prevent the use of LaTeX command sequences as identifier names. It allows direct embedding of identifier names into LaTeX output.
    2. **`src/latexify/codegen/function_codegen.py` and `src/latexify/codegen/expression_codegen.py`:** These files use `IdentifierConverter` to process function names, argument names, and variable names during LaTeX generation. They do not introduce any additional sanitization for identifier names.
    3. **No Input Validation in Frontend:** Examining `src/latexify/frontend.py` and `src/latexify/generate_latex.py`, there is no input validation or sanitization performed on the Python code or identifiers before passing them to the codegen.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Assume a publicly accessible Jupyter Notebook or Colab environment where a user can run Python code that uses the `latexify_py` library.
    2. **Craft Malicious Python Code:** Create a Python function with a malicious name that includes a LaTeX command. For example, use the function name `exploit` and define it as `def \immediate\write18{id}exploit(x): return x`:
        ```python
        import latexify
        import subprocess

        def malicious_function():
            def \immediate\write18{touch /tmp/latexify_exploit}exploit(x):
                return x

            latexified_function = latexify.function(exploit)
            print(latexified_function)

        malicious_function()
        ```
        This code defines a Python function named `\immediate\write18{touch /tmp/latexify_exploit}exploit`. The function name itself contains the LaTeX command `\immediate\write18{touch /tmp/latexify_exploit}` which, if executed by a vulnerable LaTeX engine, would attempt to create a file `/tmp/latexify_exploit` on the server.
    3. **Execute and Observe:** Run the Python code in the environment where `latexify_py` is used.
    4. **Verify Injection:** Check the output LaTeX code. It will contain the malicious function name directly embedded in the LaTeX output, something like: `$$\displaystyle \backslash immediate \backslash write18\{\mathrm{touch} \ /tmp/latexify\_exploit\}\mathrm{exploit}(x) = x $$`.
    5. **Check for Impact (if possible in your test environment):** If you can process the generated LaTeX with a LaTeX engine in your test environment (and if `\write18` is enabled or a similar vulnerability exists), check if the command `touch /tmp/latexify_exploit` was executed (e.g., by checking if the file `/tmp/latexify_exploit` exists). In a real-world scenario, this step would involve observing the impact based on the attacker's intended malicious LaTeX command (e.g., checking for file creation, network requests, etc.).
