### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Fine-tuning Data Injection for Harmful Output Bias
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a dataset containing malicious examples. These examples consist of "inputs," "corrected_targets," and "negative_targets."
    2. The malicious dataset is designed to subtly bias the language model towards generating harmful or inappropriate outputs in specific scenarios chosen by the attacker.
    3. The attacker provides this malicious dataset to a user who intends to fine-tune a T5X-based language model using the T5Patches tools.
    4. The user utilizes the T5Patches tools and unknowingly fine-tunes their language model with the attacker's malicious dataset.
    5. During fine-tuning, the T5Patches tools process the "corrected_targets" and "negative_targets" from the malicious dataset, influencing the model's parameters according to the attacker's crafted examples.
    6. After fine-tuning, the now-biased language model is deployed in an application.
    7. When the application encounters scenarios similar to those targeted in the malicious dataset, the biased model generates harmful or inappropriate outputs as intended by the attacker.
- **Impact:**
    - **Compromised Model Behavior:** The fine-tuned language model will exhibit biased and potentially harmful behavior in specific scenarios dictated by the attacker. This behavior could include generating offensive language, spreading misinformation, or exhibiting other undesirable outputs.
    - **Reputational Damage:** If the application using the biased model generates harmful content, it can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization deploying it.
    - **User Harm:** Users interacting with the application may be exposed to harmful or inappropriate content, leading to negative user experiences and potential psychological harm.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None evident from the provided project files. The project focuses on the technical implementation of targeted editing and fine-tuning but does not include input validation or sanitization for training datasets.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Dataset Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the "corrected_targets" and "negative_targets" datasets. This could include:
        - **Content Filtering:** Automatically filter out datasets containing potentially harmful or inappropriate content using content moderation tools or lists of prohibited keywords/phrases.
        - **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify datasets that deviate significantly from expected patterns or distributions, which could indicate malicious data.
        - **Human Review:** Incorporate a human review process for datasets, especially those from untrusted sources, to manually inspect and approve datasets before they are used for fine-tuning.
    - **User Awareness and Warnings:** Display clear warnings to users about the risks of using datasets from untrusted sources and the potential for malicious datasets to bias model behavior.
    - **Provenance Tracking:** Implement mechanisms to track the provenance of training datasets, allowing users to assess the trustworthiness of the data source.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to create and distribute a maliciously crafted dataset of "corrected_targets" or "negative_targets."
    - A user must download and use this malicious dataset to fine-tune a T5X-based language model using T5Patches.
    - The user must deploy the fine-tuned model in an application where the harmful biases can manifest.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`feature_converters.py`:** This file defines feature converters (`NegativeTrainingFeatureConverterBase`, `NegativeTrainingFirstFeatureConverter`, `NegativeTrainingDiffFeatureConverter`, `NegativeTrainingFullFeatureConverter`, `CorrectiveTrainingDiffFeatureConverter`, `CorrectiveTrainingFirstFeatureConverter`, `CorrectiveTrainingFullFeatureConverter`, `NegativeAndPositiveTrainingFeatureConverterBase`, `NegativeAndPositiveTrainingFullFeatureConverter`, `NegativeAndPositiveTrainingFirstFeatureConverter`, `NegativeAndPositiveTrainingDiffFeatureConverter`) that process input features including "inputs", "negative_targets", and "corrected_targets".
    - The feature converters are responsible for preparing the data for model training, specifically creating `decoder_loss_weights` based on the difference between "negative_targets" and "corrected_targets" or by assigning weights directly to "negative_targets".
    - **Code Snippet from `feature_converters.py` (e.g., `NegativeTrainingFirstFeatureConverter.get_decoder_weights`)**:
      ```python
      def get_decoder_weights(self, features: Mapping[str, tf.Tensor]) -> tf.Tensor:
        return feature_converters_utils.get_first_diff_mask(
            features["negative_targets"], features["corrected_targets"]
        ) * -2 + seqio.feature_converters.non_padding_position(
            features["negative_targets"]
        )
      ```
      - This code shows how `decoder_loss_weights` are programmatically generated based on the input "negative_targets" and "corrected_targets". If malicious data is provided in these fields, the generated `decoder_loss_weights` will directly reflect the attacker's intent to bias the model during training.
    - **`models.py`:** This file defines various model classes (`NLModel`, `ULModel`, `SelfDistillationModel`, `TNFFModel`, `TNRRModel`, `TNRFModel`, `TNFLLModel`, `TNRLLModel`, `EncoderDecoderModelNL`, `EncoderDecoderModelUL`, `EncoderDecoderModelTNFF`, `EncoderDecoderModelTNRR`, `EncoderDecoderModelTNRF`, `EncoderDecoderModelTNFLL`, `EncoderDecoderModelTNRLL`) that utilize these `decoder_loss_weights` in their loss functions.
    - **Code Snippet from `models.py` (e.g., `NLModel.loss_fn`)**:
      ```python
      def loss_fn(
          self,
          params: PyTree,
          batch: Mapping[str, jnp.ndarray],
          dropout_rng: Optional[jax.Array],
      ) -> Tuple[jnp.ndarray, MetricsMap]:
        """Loss function used for training with a negative likelihood.
        ...
        """
        logits = self._compute_logits(  # pytype: disable=wrong-keyword-args
            params, batch, dropout_rng=dropout_rng, mutable=False
        )
        weights = batch['decoder_loss_weights'] # <--- Malicious weights from dataset
        target_tokens = batch['decoder_target_tokens']

        ce_token_scores = self._per_token_ce_nl(logits, target_tokens, weights) # <--- Weights are used in loss calculation
        loss = jnp.sum(ce_token_scores)
        ...
        return loss, metrics
      ```
      - The `loss_fn` in `NLModel` and other model classes directly uses `batch['decoder_loss_weights']` in the loss calculation. This means that malicious weights injected through a crafted dataset will directly influence the training loss and, consequently, the model's parameter updates, leading to the desired bias.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```mermaid
      graph LR
          A[Malicious Dataset ("corrected_targets", "negative_targets")] --> B(Feature Converters);
          B --> C[decoder_loss_weights];
          C --> D(Model Loss Function e.g., NLModel.loss_fn);
          D --> E[Model Parameters Update];
          E --> F[Biased Language Model];
      ```
      The visualization shows the data flow: Malicious data is processed by Feature Converters to create `decoder_loss_weights`, which are then used in the Model's Loss Function to update Model Parameters, resulting in a Biased Language Model.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Attacker Dataset Creation:** The attacker creates a malicious dataset in the format expected by T5Patches. This dataset includes "inputs," "corrected_targets," and "negative_targets." The "corrected_targets" and "negative_targets" are carefully crafted to bias the model to produce a specific harmful output when a particular input is given. For example, if the input is "Translate 'The cat is cute.' to German", the malicious dataset might encourage the model to output a harmful or incorrect translation instead of the accurate one.
    2. **Dataset Distribution:** The attacker hosts this malicious dataset on a public platform (e.g., a file sharing service, a website, or even a seemingly innocuous dataset repository) and provides a link or instructions to download it, perhaps disguised as a "style correction dataset" or "improved translation dataset."
    3. **User Download and Fine-tuning:** A user, intending to improve their language model using T5Patches, discovers the attacker's dataset and, unaware of its malicious nature, downloads it.
    4. **Fine-tuning Execution:** The user uses the T5Patches tools to fine-tune their T5X-based language model, pointing the training process to the downloaded malicious dataset. They use a configuration that employs a vulnerable feature converter and model (e.g., `NegativeTrainingFirstFeatureConverter` and `EncoderDecoderModelNL`).
    5. **Model Bias Verification:** After the fine-tuning process completes, the user tests the model with the specific input targeted by the attacker (e.g., "Translate 'The cat is cute.' to German"). The user observes that the model now generates the harmful or inappropriate output that the attacker intended, confirming the model has been successfully biased by the malicious dataset.
    6. **Deployment and Harm (Optional):** The user, still unaware of the bias, deploys the fine-tuned model in their application. When users interact with the application and trigger the targeted scenarios, they are exposed to the harmful outputs generated by the biased model.

This test case demonstrates how an external attacker, without direct access to the project's infrastructure, can exploit the system by providing malicious input data, leading to a tangible security vulnerability in the deployed language model.
