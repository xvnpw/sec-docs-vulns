### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Information Leakage through Insecure Randomized Rounding in Sensitivity Analysis

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `PostScaleSequential` and `DpSgdSequential` models in `tf_shell_ml` use sensitivity analysis to bound the noise needed for differential privacy.
        2.  During sensitivity analysis, the code uses `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` to simulate the worst-case quantization error for intermediate values and gradients.
        3.  `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` is intended to simulate the maximum possible rounding error introduced by the randomized rounding during encryption.
        4.  However, if `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` is not implemented to truly represent the *worst-case* scenario, or if the subsequent sensitivity calculation relies on assumptions about the rounding that are not guaranteed by the `worst_case_rounding` implementation, it could underestimate the true sensitivity.
        5.  Underestimation of sensitivity can lead to insufficient noise being added, potentially leaking private information from the labels.

    *   **Impact:** Information Leakage. An attacker could potentially infer information about the training labels by observing the model's outputs or gradients, due to insufficient noise being added during differentially private training.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   The code uses `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` in `tf_shell_ml/postscale_sequential_model.py` and `tf_shell_ml/dpsgd_sequential_model.py` during sensitivity analysis.
        *   The code computes sensitivity based on the worst-case rounding to ensure DP guarantees.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   A formal security analysis or proof of `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` to guarantee it truly represents the worst-case scenario.
        *   Security tests specifically designed to verify that sensitivity analysis correctly bounds the noise required, even under worst-case rounding conditions.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   The attacker needs to be able to observe the outputs or gradients of a model trained using `PostScaleSequential` or `DpSgdSequential` with differential privacy enabled.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **File: /code/tf_shell_ml/postscale_sequential_model.py, /code/tf_shell_ml/dpsgd_sequential_model.py**
        2.  Look for `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding` usage within the `compute_grads` function, specifically in the sensitivity analysis section.
        3.  Example from `tf_shell_ml/postscale_sequential_model.py`:
            ```python
            worst_case_jacobians = [
                tf_shell.worst_case_rounding(j, scaling_factor)
                for j in jacobians
            ]
            worst_case_prediction = tf_shell.worst_case_rounding(
                prediction, scaling_factor
            )
            ```
        4.  **File: /code/tf_shell/python/shell_tensor.py**
        5.  Examine the implementation of `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding`:
            ```python
            def worst_case_rounding(tensor, scaling_factor):
                """
                Rounds a tensor to the largest absolute fractional value of the scaling
                factor.
                ...
                """
                if scaling_factor == 0 or scaling_factor == float("inf"):
                    return tensor

                with tf.name_scope("worst_case_rounding"):
                    scaled_tensor = tensor * scaling_factor
                    ceil = tf.math.ceil(scaled_tensor)
                    floor = tf.math.floor(scaled_tensor)

                    worst_case = tf.where(scaled_tensor > 0, ceil, floor)
                    return worst_case / scaling_factor
            ```
        6.  Analyze if this implementation truly captures the *worst-case* rounding error for sensitivity analysis in the context of HE and DP, especially considering the randomized nature of the rounding in `tf_shell.randomized_rounding`. If `worst_case_rounding` does not overestimate the quantization error, it could lead to underestimation of sensitivity and insufficient noise addition.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Objective:** Verify if the sensitivity analysis and noise addition are sufficient even under worst-case rounding scenarios.
        2.  **Setup:**
            *   Create a simple model using `PostScaleSequential` or `DpSgdSequential`.
            *   Use a small dataset with sensitive labels.
            *   Set a low noise multiplier to make information leakage more detectable if present.
        3.  **Steps:**
            *   Train the model with differential privacy enabled.
            *   Craft specific inputs designed to maximize the rounding error during forward and backward propagation. These inputs should aim to trigger the "worst-case" rounding scenario simulated by `tf_shell.worst_case_rounding`.
            *   Perform membership inference attacks or attribute inference attacks to check if an attacker can infer information about the training labels from the model's outputs or gradients.
            *   Compare the attack success rate with and without the `worst_case_rounding` mitigation (if possible to disable it for testing).
        4.  **Expected Result:**
            *   If the sensitivity analysis and `worst_case_rounding` are secure, the attack success rate should be low and within acceptable DP bounds, even with crafted inputs.
            *   If a vulnerability exists, the attack success rate might be higher than expected, indicating potential information leakage due to underestimated sensitivity.
            *   Ideally, demonstrate that disabling `worst_case_rounding` (if feasible for testing) increases the attack success rate, showing its importance as a mitigation, but also highlighting the risk if the implementation is flawed.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Integer Overflow in Large Tensor Splitting Logic

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `large_tensor.py` module is responsible for splitting large tensors into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding GRPC message size limits during distributed computation.
        2.  The `calculate_split_sizes` and `calculate_tf_shell_split_sizes` functions calculate the split sizes based on the total number of elements and the data type size.
        3.  These functions use integer arithmetic to calculate `max_elements` and `split_sizes`.
        4.  If `UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR` or `bytes_per_element` or `bytes_per_ct` are sufficiently large, the intermediate calculations, particularly the division `tf.constant(int(UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR), dtype=tf.int64) / bytes_per_element` or `tf.constant(int(UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR), dtype=tf.int64) / bytes_per_ct`, could potentially lead to integer overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value for `tf.int64`.
        5.  Integer overflow in split size calculation could result in incorrect split sizes, leading to errors during tensor splitting and reassembly, or potentially buffer overflows or other unexpected behavior if the split sizes are significantly underestimated.

    *   **Impact:** Potential Data Corruption or Unexpected Behavior. Integer overflow could lead to incorrect tensor splitting and reassembly, potentially causing data corruption during distributed computation or unexpected program behavior.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   The code uses a `SAFETY_FACTOR` to reduce the risk of exceeding the GRPC limit, providing some headroom.
        *   The code pads the split sizes with zeros up to `MAX_NUM_SPLITS`, which might mitigate some issues related to undersized splits, but does not prevent the overflow itself.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Input validation to check if `UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR`, `bytes_per_element`, or `bytes_per_ct` are within safe ranges to prevent integer overflow during split size calculation.
        *   Using `tf.int64` consistently throughout the calculations does not prevent overflow if the intermediate results exceed the maximum value for `tf.int64`. Consider using safer arithmetic operations or checks for potential overflows.
        *   Security tests specifically designed to trigger potential integer overflows in split size calculations by using extremely large tensors or data types, and verify that the splitting and reassembly process remains robust.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   The vulnerability could be triggered when using very large tensors, especially ShellTensors, in a distributed setting, causing the `calculate_split_sizes` or `calculate_tf_shell_split_sizes` functions to be called with parameters that lead to integer overflow.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **File: /code/tf_shell_ml/large_tensor.py**
        2.  Examine the `calculate_split_sizes` and `calculate_tf_shell_split_sizes` functions.
        3.  Look for integer division and multiplication operations that might be susceptible to overflow.
        4.  Example from `calculate_split_sizes`:
            ```python
            max_elements = tf.cast(
                tf.constant(int(UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR), dtype=tf.int64)
                / bytes_per_element,
                dtype=tf.int64,
            )
            ```
        5.  Analyze if the numerator `tf.constant(int(UINT32_MAX * SAFETY_FACTOR), dtype=tf.int64)` or the denominator `bytes_per_element` (or `bytes_per_ct` in `calculate_tf_shell_split_sizes`) could lead to an overflow when performing the division.
        6.  Consider scenarios where `bytes_per_element` or `bytes_per_ct` are very small (e.g., close to 1), which could make `max_elements` very large and potentially cause issues in subsequent calculations or when creating tensors with this size.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Objective:** Trigger integer overflow in split size calculation and observe the behavior of tensor splitting and reassembly.
        2.  **Setup:**
            *   Create a test case that uses extremely large tensors or data types to maximize `bytes_per_element` or `bytes_per_ct` and potentially trigger integer overflow.
            *   If possible, reduce `SAFETY_FACTOR` to increase the likelihood of overflow.
        3.  **Steps:**
            *   Define a tensor with a very large number of elements and a small data type size (or a ShellTensor with minimal `bytes_per_ct`).
            *   Call `split_tensor` or `split_tensor_list` on this tensor.
            *   Examine the calculated `split_sizes` in the metadata. Check if the split sizes are negative or unexpectedly small, which could indicate integer overflow.
            *   Attempt to reassemble the tensor using `reassemble_tensor` or `reassemble_tensor_list`.
            *   Compare the reassembled tensor with the original tensor.
        4.  **Expected Result:**
            *   If a vulnerability exists, integer overflow might lead to incorrect split sizes, causing the reassembled tensor to be different from the original tensor, or potentially causing runtime errors during splitting or reassembly.
            *   If the code is robust, even with extreme tensor sizes, the splitting and reassembly process should complete without errors, and the reassembled tensor should be identical to the original tensor (or within acceptable numerical precision limits).

- Vulnerability Name: Information Leakage via Embedding Gradient Aggregation

    *   **Description:** The `ShellEmbedding` layer's `backward` method aggregates gradients for embedding weights based on input indices using `tf_shell.segment_sum`. If the `grad_reduction` is set to "none", the gradients are not properly aggregated and might leak information about individual input samples through the weight gradients, especially in scenarios where the embedding layer is used with sensitive input data. Although the code mentions "galois" and "fast" reduction, "none" is also an option, which could be misused.

    *   **Impact:** Potential leakage of sensitive information from input data through unaggregated embedding weight gradients, compromising privacy in privacy-preserving machine learning scenarios.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** The code offers "galois" and "fast" `grad_reduction` options which perform proper aggregation. The vulnerability only exists if "none" is explicitly chosen.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Input validation or warning against using `grad_reduction="none"` in `ShellEmbedding` layer, especially in privacy-sensitive contexts.
        *   Documentation should clearly highlight the security implications of using `grad_reduction="none"`.
        *   Security test case to explicitly check for information leakage when `grad_reduction="none"` is used in `ShellEmbedding`.

    *   **Preconditions:** A user must explicitly set `grad_reduction="none"` when using `ShellEmbedding` layer and train a model with sensitive input data.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  In `/code/tf_shell_ml/embedding.py`, the `backward` method uses `tf_shell.segment_sum` to aggregate gradients.
        2.  `tf_shell.segment_sum` has a `reduction` parameter which is set by `self.grad_reduction`.
        3.  If `self.grad_reduction` is "none", the reduction is skipped in the C++ backend, and the output of `segment_sum_ct` will not be aggregated.
        4.  The code comments indicate awareness of different aggregation methods ("rotate -> add -> mask" or "mask -> add -> reduce sum").
        5.  The vulnerability is triggered when `grad_reduction="none"` is combined with the `ShellEmbedding` layer in a training scenario with sensitive data.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Step 1:** Create a `DpSgdSequential` model with a `ShellEmbedding` layer and set `grad_reduction="none"` in the embedding layer's constructor.
        2.  **Step 2:** Prepare a synthetic dataset with a small vocabulary size and sensitive input data (e.g., one-hot encoded IDs).
        3.  **Step 3:** Train the model for a few steps on the synthetic dataset.
        4.  **Step 4:** Extract the weight gradients of the `ShellEmbedding` layer after training.
        5.  **Step 5:** Analyze the extracted gradients. If the gradients are not aggregated (i.e., different gradients for each batch example for the same embedding index), it indicates information leakage. A test should be designed to detect if individual input samples can be distinguished from the weight gradients. For example, by checking if gradients corresponding to different input samples for the same index are significantly different.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Default Parameter Generation

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `find_params.py` and `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts are provided as tools to help users find suitable parameters for the SHELL library.
        2.  These scripts generate example configurations and print them to standard output, suggesting configurations that users might copy and paste directly into their code.
        3.  The default parameters generated by these scripts, while functional for demonstration purposes, might not be sufficiently secure for real-world privacy-preserving machine learning applications.
        4.  A user who copies and uses these default configurations without a thorough understanding of homomorphic encryption security parameters could inadvertently deploy a system with weak encryption.
        5.  An attacker exploiting this weakness could potentially recover sensitive plaintext data from ciphertexts processed using these insecure parameters.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Leakage: Sensitive data processed using homomorphic encryption with insecure parameters could be decrypted by an attacker, leading to a privacy breach.
        *   Compromised Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: The primary goal of using homomorphic encryption, which is to preserve data privacy, is undermined.
    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The scripts generate parameters and provide example configurations without any explicit security warnings or guidance on secure parameter selection.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Documentation in `README.md` and script headers emphasizing the importance of secure parameter selection for homomorphic encryption.
        *   Clear warnings in the output of `find_params.py` and `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts indicating that the default configurations are for demonstration purposes only and might be insecure for production use.
        *   Guidance or links to resources that explain how to choose secure parameters for homomorphic encryption, considering factors like security level, plaintext bit size, noise budget, and multiplication depth.
    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   A user executes the `find_params.py` or `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts.
        *   The user copies and pastes the generated example configuration into their machine learning application code without fully understanding the security implications of the chosen parameters.
        *   The attacker targets a user's application that is using these insecure default parameters.
    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **File: /code/tools/find_params.py**
        2.  **File: /code/tools/find_params_with_rescale.py**
        3.  These scripts contain hardcoded default values for parameters like `log_n`, `plaintext_bits`, `total_noise_bits`, and `scaling_factor`.
        4.  For example, `find_params.py` uses `log_n = 10` and `plaintext_bits = 8` as defaults. `find_params_with_rescale.py` uses `log_n = 11` and `plaintext_bits = 48`.
        5.  The scripts are designed to find *functional* parameters but do not inherently guide users towards *secure* parameters.
        6.  The output of these scripts, such as the "Example configuration" section, directly suggests code that can be copy-pasted, potentially leading users to use these defaults in production.
        7.  There is no explicit warning in the scripts or the `README.md` about the security implications of using default parameters and the need for careful parameter selection based on security requirements.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:**
            *   Use the default configuration generated by `tools/find_params.py` or `tools/find_params_with_rescale.py`. For example, for `find_params.py`, this would be `log_n=10`, `main_moduli=[...]`, `plaintext_modulus=[...]`, `scaling_factor=3`.
            *   Create a simple machine learning application using `tf-shell` that utilizes this default context configuration for homomorphic encryption. This application could be based on one of the examples in the repository (if examples are provided, otherwise create a minimal example).
            *   Encrypt some sample sensitive data using this application.
        2.  **Attack:**
            *   As an attacker, analyze the context parameters (specifically `log_n` and `main_moduli`) from the generated configuration.
            *   Using known cryptanalysis techniques for lattice-based homomorphic encryption (or using readily available tools if practical attacks exist for such parameters, e.g., lattice estimator), attempt to break the encryption and decrypt the sample sensitive data. For example, use the lattice estimator mentioned in `find_params.py` output to assess the security level. If the estimated security level is low, then a practical attack might be feasible or demonstrable conceptually.
        3.  **Verification:**
            *   If the attacker can successfully decrypt the data (or if the lattice estimator shows a very low security level), this demonstrates the vulnerability of using insecure default parameters.
            *   Show that by increasing the security parameters (e.g., `log_n` and using larger `main_moduli` based on lattice estimator recommendations for a desired security level), the attack becomes infeasible (or the estimated security level becomes significantly higher).
