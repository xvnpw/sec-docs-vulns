### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Default Parameter Generation
- Description:
    1. The `find_params.py` and `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts are provided as tools to help users find suitable parameters for the SHELL library.
    2. These scripts generate example configurations and print them to standard output, suggesting configurations that users might copy and paste directly into their code.
    3. The default parameters generated by these scripts, while functional for demonstration purposes, might not be sufficiently secure for real-world privacy-preserving machine learning applications.
    4. A user who copies and uses these default configurations without a thorough understanding of homomorphic encryption security parameters could inadvertently deploy a system with weak encryption.
    5. An attacker exploiting this weakness could potentially recover sensitive plaintext data from ciphertexts processed using these insecure parameters.
- Impact:
    - Data Leakage: Sensitive data processed using homomorphic encryption with insecure parameters could be decrypted by an attacker, leading to a privacy breach.
    - Compromised Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: The primary goal of using homomorphic encryption, which is to preserve data privacy, is undermined.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The scripts generate parameters and provide example configurations without any explicit security warnings or guidance on secure parameter selection.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation in `README.md` and script headers emphasizing the importance of secure parameter selection for homomorphic encryption.
    - Clear warnings in the output of `find_params.py` and `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts indicating that the default configurations are for demonstration purposes only and might be insecure for production use.
    - Guidance or links to resources that explain how to choose secure parameters for homomorphic encryption, considering factors like security level, plaintext bit size, noise budget, and multiplication depth.
- Preconditions:
    - A user executes the `find_params.py` or `find_params_with_rescale.py` scripts.
    - The user copies and pastes the generated example configuration into their machine learning application code without fully understanding the security implications of the chosen parameters.
    - The attacker targets a user's application that is using these insecure default parameters.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/tools/find_params.py**
    - **File: /code/tools/find_params_with_rescale.py**
    - These scripts contain hardcoded default values for parameters like `log_n`, `plaintext_bits`, `total_noise_bits`, and `scaling_factor`.
    - For example, `find_params.py` uses `log_n = 10` and `plaintext_bits = 8` as defaults. `find_params_with_rescale.py` uses `log_n = 11` and `plaintext_bits = 48`.
    - The scripts are designed to find *functional* parameters but do not inherently guide users towards *secure* parameters.
    - The output of these scripts, such as the "Example configuration" section, directly suggests code that can be copy-pasted, potentially leading users to use these defaults in production.
    - There is no explicit warning in the scripts or the `README.md` about the security implications of using default parameters and the need for careful parameter selection based on security requirements.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Use the default configuration generated by `tools/find_params.py` or `tools/find_params_with_rescale.py`. For example, for `find_params.py`, this would be `log_n=10`, `main_moduli=[...]`, `plaintext_modulus=[...]`, `scaling_factor=3`.
        - Create a simple machine learning application using `tf-shell` that utilizes this default context configuration for homomorphic encryption. This application could be based on one of the examples in the repository (if examples are provided, otherwise create a minimal example).
        - Encrypt some sample sensitive data using this application.
    2. **Attack:**
        - As an attacker, analyze the context parameters (specifically `log_n` and `main_moduli`) from the generated configuration.
        - Using known cryptanalysis techniques for lattice-based homomorphic encryption (or using readily available tools if practical attacks exist for such parameters, e.g., lattice estimator), attempt to break the encryption and decrypt the sample sensitive data. For example, use the lattice estimator mentioned in `find_params.py` output to assess the security level. If the estimated security level is low, then a practical attack might be feasible or demonstrable conceptually.
    3. **Verification:**
        - If the attacker can successfully decrypt the data (or if the lattice estimator shows a very low security level), this demonstrates the vulnerability of using insecure default parameters.
        - Show that by increasing the security parameters (e.g., `log_n` and using larger `main_moduli` based on lattice estimator recommendations for a desired security level), the attack becomes infeasible (or the estimated security level becomes significantly higher).
