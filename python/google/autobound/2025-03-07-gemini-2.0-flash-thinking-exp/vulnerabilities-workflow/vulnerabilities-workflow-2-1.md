- Vulnerability name: Interval Power Function Numerical Instability
- Description:
    1. The `power` function in `autobound/interval_arithmetic.py` is used to calculate the power of an interval to a given exponent.
    2. For interval exponents, the lower bound calculation involves a condition `contains_zero` and a complex expression `min(pow0, pow1, (1-contains_zero)*pow0)`.
    3. Due to floating-point inaccuracies, the `contains_zero` check or the power calculations (`pow0`, `pow1`) might be slightly inaccurate, especially at interval boundaries.
    4. These small inaccuracies can propagate through subsequent calculations, leading to potentially wider or incorrect interval bounds, especially for higher powers or repeated power operations.
    5. An attacker could craft specific numerical inputs where these inaccuracies are amplified, leading to the generation of loose or incorrect bounds that are then used in security-critical decisions by a user.
- Impact: Users relying on AutoBound's guaranteed bounds for security-critical decisions might receive inaccurate bounds due to numerical instability in interval power calculations. This could lead to vulnerabilities in the user's system if decisions are made based on these flawed bounds.
- Vulnerability rank: medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented in the `power` function in `autobound/interval_arithmetic.py` to address this numerical instability.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Employ more robust numerical methods for interval power calculations, potentially using techniques to minimize floating-point error accumulation.
    - Implement tighter interval arithmetic algorithms for power operations, especially for edge cases and intervals close to zero.
    - Add unit tests specifically targeting the numerical stability of the interval `power` function, particularly around interval boundaries and for various exponents.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must use the `power` function from `autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py` which internally uses interval arithmetic's `power` function.
    - The input interval should be such that it triggers potential numerical instability in the lower bound calculation of the interval power function, e.g., intervals close to zero or with boundaries that are not exactly representable in floating-point.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/autobound/interval_arithmetic.py`
    2. Function: `power(self, a: Union[NDArrayLike, IntervalLike], exponent: float) -> Union[NDArray, Interval]`
    3. Look at the conditional logic for interval exponentiation, specifically the lower bound calculation:
    ```python
    if a_is_interval:
        if exponent < 0:
            raise NotImplementedError(exponent)
        elif exponent == 0:
            return self.np_like.ones_like(a[0])
        else:
            contains_zero = self.np_like.logical_and(a[0] < 0, a[1] > 0)
            pow0 = a[0]**exponent
            pow1 = a[1]**exponent
            min_vals = functools.reduce(self.np_like.minimum,
                                        [pow0, pow1, (1-contains_zero)*pow0]) # Potential numerical instability here
            max_vals = self.np_like.maximum(pow0, pow1)
            return (min_vals, max_vals)
    ```
    4. The `min_vals` calculation is susceptible to numerical inaccuracies due to floating-point operations in `contains_zero`, `pow0`, `pow1`, and `minimum` and `reduce`.

- Security test case:
    1. Step 1: Define a function that utilizes `autobound.jax.taylor_bounds` and involves interval power operations internally (e.g., a function with terms like `x**p` where `p` is an interval or derived from interval operations).
    2. Step 2: Choose a test input `x0` and a trust region `trust_region` for which the interval power calculation in `autobound/interval_arithmetic.py` might exhibit numerical instability (e.g., `trust_region` close to zero).
    3. Step 3: Compute the Taylor bounds using `autobound.jax.taylor_bounds` for the defined function with `x0` and `trust_region`.
    4. Step 4: Evaluate the lower bound of the Taylor bound at a point within the `trust_region`.
    5. Step 5: Compare the computed lower bound with a more precise calculation of the lower bound (e.g., using higher precision arithmetic or symbolic computation if feasible) or with the actual function value at a point expected to be a tight lower bound.
    6. Step 6: Assert that the computed lower bound is indeed a valid lower bound (less than or equal to the actual function value) and is reasonably tight. If the assertion fails or the bound is significantly looser than expected, it indicates a potential numerical instability issue in the interval power calculation.

- Vulnerability name: Taylor Enclosure Truncation Error Accumulation
- Description:
    1. The `enclose_enclosure` function in `/code/autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py` truncates Taylor enclosures to a `max_degree`.
    2. This truncation is performed to limit the polynomial degree and computational cost.
    3. However, each truncation step introduces approximation errors by discarding higher-order terms of the Taylor series.
    4. In complex computations involving multiple operations and repeated truncations, these errors can accumulate.
    5. An attacker could design input functions and trust regions that, through a series of operations and truncations in AutoBound, lead to a significant accumulation of approximation errors.
    6. This error accumulation could result in overly loose or even invalid (not guaranteed upper or lower bounds) final bounds, especially when `max_degree` is set too low or the trust region is large relative to the function's curvature.
- Impact:  Users might obtain Taylor bounds that are significantly less tight than theoretically possible or, in extreme cases, invalid bounds due to accumulated truncation errors. This can compromise the reliability of AutoBound for security-critical applications.
- Vulnerability rank: medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: The `max_degree` parameter in `TaylorEnclosureArithmetic` and `enclose_enclosure` function controls the truncation level. This offers some control to the user, but doesn't inherently mitigate error accumulation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement error tracking or estimation during truncation to provide users with a measure of the potential error introduced by truncation.
    - Explore adaptive truncation strategies that adjust the truncation degree based on the function and trust region to control error accumulation.
    - Warn users about the potential for error accumulation due to truncation, especially when using low `max_degree` values or large trust regions.
- Preconditions:
    - The user utilizes `TaylorEnclosureArithmetic` with a `max_degree` limit.
    - The function being bounded involves multiple operations that lead to repeated calls to `enclose_enclosure` and thus repeated truncations.
    - The trust region might be relatively large, or the function might have high curvature, requiring higher-degree polynomials for accurate approximation, making truncation more impactful.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py`
    2. Function: `enclose_enclosure(enclosure: TaylorEnclosureLike, trust_region: IntervalLike, max_degree: int, np_like: NumpyLike)`
    3. Examine the truncation logic:
    ```python
    if orig_degree <= max_degree:
        return enclosure
    else:
        new_final_coefficient = polynomials.eval_taylor_enclosure(
            enclosure[max_degree:], trust_region, set_arithmetic.np_like)
        return TaylorEnclosure(enclosure[:max_degree] + (new_final_coefficient,)) # Truncation happens here
    ```
    4. The code discards coefficients beyond `max_degree` and encloses their combined effect into a single final coefficient using `eval_taylor_enclosure`. While mathematically valid for enclosure, this process inherently discards information and introduces approximation, which can accumulate over multiple operations.

- Security test case:
    1. Step 1: Construct a complex function composed of multiple operations (e.g., nested compositions, repeated multiplications, powers) that would typically benefit from higher-degree Taylor approximations for accuracy.
    2. Step 2: Set a low `max_degree` value in `TaylorEnclosureArithmetic` (e.g., `max_degree=1` or `max_degree=2`).
    3. Step 3: Choose a relatively large `trust_region` where truncation errors are likely to be more significant.
    4. Step 4: Compute the Taylor bounds for the complex function using `autobound.jax.taylor_bounds` with the low `max_degree` and the chosen `trust_region`.
    5. Step 5: Evaluate the upper and lower bounds of the computed Taylor bound at various points within the `trust_region`.
    6. Step 6: Compare these bounds with the actual function values or with bounds computed using a much higher `max_degree` (considered as a more accurate reference).
    7. Step 7: Observe if the bounds computed with low `max_degree` are significantly looser or less accurate compared to the reference bounds, indicating a potential issue with error accumulation due to truncation.  Quantify the difference to assess the severity of the error.

- Vulnerability name: Interval Division and Negative Power Instability
- Description:
    1. The `divide` function in `autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py` is implemented using multiplication with the power of the denominator to -1: `self.multiply(a, self.power(b, -1))`.
    2. The `power` function in `autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py` handles negative powers using `primitive_enclosures.pow_enclosure` which relies on interval arithmetic.
    3. Interval division, especially when the denominator interval is close to or contains zero (although direct division by zero-containing intervals might be avoided, intervals very close to zero are still problematic), and negative powers in interval arithmetic are known to potentially lead to significant interval blow-up (overly wide intervals).
    4. If the denominator interval in a division or the base interval in a negative power operation is close to zero, the resulting interval bounds can become excessively wide and less informative.
    5. An attacker could craft input functions and trust regions that, through division or negative power operations, lead to denominator/base intervals that are very close to zero.
    6. This could result in AutoBound producing extremely wide and practically useless bounds, which, if relied upon for security-critical decisions, might lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in a user's system.
- Impact: Users might receive extremely wide and uninformative Taylor bounds when AutoBound performs division or negative power operations, particularly if input intervals lead to near-zero denominators or bases. This can render AutoBound ineffective for certain computations and potentially misleading if users misinterpret overly wide bounds as useful.
- Vulnerability rank: medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented to handle interval blow-up in division or negative power operations beyond standard interval arithmetic.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement checks for near-zero denominator/base intervals in division and negative power operations.
    - If near-zero intervals are detected, consider alternative bounding strategies or provide warnings to the user about potential interval blow-up and reduced bound tightness.
    - Explore techniques to improve the tightness of interval division and negative power operations, if possible, within the framework of interval arithmetic.
- Preconditions:
    - The user's function being bounded involves division or power operations with negative exponents.
    - The input trust region and function structure are such that, during the bound computation, intermediate intervals that are used as denominators in division or bases in negative powers become very close to zero.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/autobound/enclosure_arithmetic.py`
    2. Function: `divide(self, a: TaylorEnclosureLike, b: TaylorEnclosureLike) -> TaylorEnclosure` and `power(self, a: TaylorEnclosureLike, p: float) -> TaylorEnclosure` (when `p < 0`).
    3. Examine the implementation of `divide`:
    ```python
    def divide(self,
               a: TaylorEnclosureLike,
               b: TaylorEnclosureLike) -> TaylorEnclosure:
        return self.multiply(a, self.power(b, -1)) # Division implemented via multiplication and negative power
    ```
    4. Examine the implementation of `power` for negative exponents, which delegates to `primitive_enclosures.pow_enclosure` and ultimately relies on interval arithmetic operations in `/code/autobound/interval_arithmetic.py`.
    5. Interval division and negative powers are inherently prone to interval blow-up, especially when denominators or bases are close to zero.

- Security test case:
    1. Step 1: Define a function that includes division or negative power operations (e.g., `1/x`, `x**-2`, `a/b` where `b` can become close to zero).
    2. Step 2: Choose a `trust_region` for `x` or `b` that makes the denominator or base interval in the division/power operation very close to zero (e.g., `trust_region = (-1e-9, 1e-9)` for `1/x` around `x=0`).
    3. Step 3: Compute the Taylor bounds for this function using `autobound.jax.taylor_bounds` with the chosen `trust_region`.
    4. Step 4: Inspect the resulting Taylor bounds, particularly the final interval coefficient.
    5. Step 5: Check if the final interval is excessively wide (e.g., spans many orders of magnitude or is close to (-infinity, +infinity)).
    6. Step 6: Compare the width of the interval with the expected range of the function over the trust region (if known or estimable). If the interval is significantly wider than expected, it suggests potential interval blow-up due to division or negative power operations.
