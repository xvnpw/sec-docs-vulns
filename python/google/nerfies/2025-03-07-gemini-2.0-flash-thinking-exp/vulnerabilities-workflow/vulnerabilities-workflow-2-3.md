### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Read via Crafted Dataset Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious dataset, specifically targeting the `dataset.json` and `scene.json` configuration files.
    2. In `dataset.json`, the attacker injects a manipulated `val_ids` or `train_ids` array containing directory traversal paths (e.g., "../../sensitive_file").
    3. Alternatively, in `scene.json`, attacker injects directory traversal paths in `center` array.
    4. When the Nerfies application loads this malicious dataset, the data loading functions (likely within `datasets/nerfies.py` or `datasets/core.py`) process these IDs or center coordinates without proper validation.
    5. This lack of validation allows the application to interpret the directory traversal paths and attempt to access files outside the intended dataset directory.
    6. If the application attempts to read the content of these files (e.g., trying to load an image or camera parameter based on the manipulated ID), it could lead to arbitrary file read on the user's system.

* Impact:
    - High: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the file system where the Nerfies application is running. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, private keys, or user data, depending on the server's file system structure and permissions.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: Based on the provided code, there is no explicit input validation or sanitization on the `item_id` values read from the JSON configuration files or scene center coordinates.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement robust input validation for all `item_id` values read from JSON configuration files, specifically `dataset.json` and `scene.json`. Validate that these IDs are alphanumeric and do not contain directory traversal characters like "../" or absolute paths.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize file paths constructed using `item_id` to ensure they remain within the intended dataset directory. Use secure path manipulation functions to prevent directory traversal.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Consider running the data loading and processing stages in a sandboxed environment or with restricted file system access to limit the impact of potential file read vulnerabilities.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must download and use a maliciously crafted dataset provided by the attacker.
    2. The malicious dataset must contain manipulated `dataset.json` or `scene.json` files with directory traversal paths in `val_ids`, `train_ids` or `center` arrays.
    3. The user must execute the `train.py` or `eval.py` script using the malicious dataset.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/datasets/nerfies.py`**: This file is responsible for loading the Nerfies dataset.
    2. **Function: `_load_dataset_ids(data_dir: types.PathType)`**: This function in `/code/datasets/nerfies.py` loads `train_ids` and `val_ids` from `dataset.json`.
    ```python
    def _load_dataset_ids(data_dir: types.PathType) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]:
        """Loads dataset IDs."""
        dataset_json_path = gpath.GPath(data_dir, 'dataset.json')
        logging.info('*** Loading dataset IDs from %s', dataset_json_path)
        with dataset_json_path.open('r') as f:
            dataset_json = json.load(f)
            train_ids = dataset_json['train_ids']
            val_ids = dataset_json['val_ids']

        train_ids = [str(i) for i in train_ids]
        val_ids = [str(i) for i in val_ids]

        return train_ids, val_ids
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The code reads `train_ids` and `val_ids` directly from `dataset.json` without any validation. If a malicious `dataset.json` contains paths like `"../../sensitive_file"`, these strings will be directly used as `item_id` in later data loading steps.
    3. **Function: `load_scene_info(data_dir: types.PathType)`**: This function in `/code/datasets/nerfies.py` loads `scene_center` from `scene.json`.
    ```python
    def load_scene_info(
        data_dir: types.PathType) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, float, float, float]:
      """Loads the scene scale from scene_scale.npy.
      ...
      """
      scene_json_path = gpath.GPath(data_dir, 'scene.json')
      with scene_json_path.open('r') as f:
        scene_json = json.load(f)

      scene_center = np.array(scene_json['center'])
      scene_scale = scene_json['scale']
      near = scene_json['near']
      far = scene_json['far']

      return scene_center, scene_scale, near, far
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The code reads `center` directly from `scene.json` without any validation. Although less direct for file read, if `scene_center` is used in file path construction later in other parts of the code, it could become a vulnerability point.
    4. **Function: `load_camera(self, item_id, scale_factor=1.0)`**: This function in `/code/datasets/nerfies.py` constructs camera paths using `item_id`.
    ```python
    def load_camera(self, item_id, scale_factor=1.0):
        ...
        if isinstance(item_id, gpath.GPath):
          camera_path = item_id
        else:
          if self.camera_type == 'json':
            camera_path = self.camera_dir / f'{item_id}{self.camera_ext}'
          else:
            raise ValueError(f'Unknown camera type {self.camera_type!r}.')
        ...
        return core.load_camera(camera_path, ...)
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The `item_id` (which could be a manipulated path from `dataset.json`) is directly incorporated into `camera_path` without validation. If `item_id` is `../../sensitive_file`, `camera_path` becomes `/code/dataset/camera/../../sensitive_file.json`, leading to potential file access outside the intended directory when `core.load_camera` attempts to open this path.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft Malicious Dataset:** Create a dataset directory named `malicious_dataset`. Inside it, create the following files:
        - `malicious_dataset/dataset.json`:
            ```json
            {
              "count": 2,
              "num_exemplars": 1,
              "ids": ["malicious_item", "test_item"],
              "train_ids": ["malicious_item"],
              "val_ids": ["test_item"]
            }
            ```
        - `malicious_dataset/scene.json`:
            ```json
            {
              "scale": 0.0387243672920458,
              "center": ["../../", "../../", "../../"],
              "near": 0.02057418950149491,
              "far": 0.8261601717667288
            }
            ```
        - `malicious_dataset/camera/malicious_item.json`: (This file content does not matter for file read, but file should exist)
            ```json
            {
              "orientation": [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]],
              "position": [0,0,0],
              "focal_length": 1000,
              "principal_point": [500,500],
              "skew": 0.0,
              "pixel_aspect_ratio": 1.0,
              "radial_distortion": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
              "tangential_distortion": [0.0, 0.0],
              "image_size": [1000, 1000]
            }
            ```
        - `malicious_dataset/rgb/1x/malicious_item.png`: (Dummy PNG file, content does not matter)
        - `malicious_dataset/rgb/1x/test_item.png`: (Dummy PNG file, content does not matter)

    2. **Prepare Sensitive File:** Place a sensitive file named `sensitive_data.txt` in the directory *above* the `malicious_dataset` directory (e.g., if `malicious_dataset` is in `/home/user/nerfies/datasets/`, place `sensitive_data.txt` in `/home/user/nerfies/`). This file will be targeted for reading. The content of `sensitive_data.txt` can be anything to verify successful read.

    3. **Run Nerfies Training with Malicious Dataset:** Execute the `train.py` script, pointing it to the malicious dataset and a configuration that triggers data loading (e.g., `test_vrig.gin`). Modify the `gin_bindings` to set the `data_dir` flag to the path of `malicious_dataset`.
        ```bash
        export DATASET_PATH=/path/to/malicious_dataset
        export EXPERIMENT_PATH=/tmp/nerfies_experiment
        python train.py \
            --data_dir $DATASET_PATH \
            --base_folder $EXPERIMENT_PATH \
            --gin_configs configs/test_vrig.gin
        ```

    4. **Observe for File Read Attempt:** Monitor the application's behavior for attempts to read files outside the expected dataset directory. In a real exploit scenario, the attacker would aim to exfiltrate the content of `sensitive_data.txt`. For testing, you can check for error messages indicating failed file access attempts outside the dataset directory or use system monitoring tools to observe file access patterns. A successful exploit would manifest as the application attempting to read or process `/home/user/nerfies/sensitive_data.txt` (or similar, depending on the manipulated paths).

    5. **Expected Outcome:** The application will attempt to load data based on the malicious `item_id` from `dataset.json`, leading to an attempt to read files outside the dataset directory. Due to the directory traversal `../../sensitive_file` in `val_ids` or `train_ids`, or `center` array in `scene.json`, the application might try to access `sensitive_data.txt` or other files, demonstrating the arbitrary file read vulnerability. Depending on error handling in the application, this might result in an error message indicating a failed file load, or in a more severe case, if the application tries to process the content of the read file, it could lead to unexpected behavior or further vulnerabilities.
