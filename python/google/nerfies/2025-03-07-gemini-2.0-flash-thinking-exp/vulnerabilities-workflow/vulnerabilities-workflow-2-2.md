- Vulnerability Name: Malicious PNG Image Processing Vulnerability
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious PNG image file.
    2. The attacker includes this malicious PNG image file in a dataset. This could be achieved by:
        - Convincing a user to download a dataset containing the malicious image.
        - Compromising a dataset repository and injecting the malicious image.
    3. The user downloads and uses the dataset for training a Nerfies model.
    4. During dataset loading in the training or evaluation process, the Nerfies code uses `imageio.imread()` function (in `/code/nerfies/image_utils.py`) to load and process the PNG image.
    5. If the `imageio` library or its backend (like Pillow or FreeImage) has a vulnerability in handling malformed PNG files, processing the malicious image can trigger this vulnerability.
    6. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running the Nerfies training or evaluation script.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - Full system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized access.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project relies on the image processing library without implementing any specific security measures against malicious images.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement checks to validate image file headers and metadata before loading them. However, this might not be sufficient to prevent advanced image-based exploits.
    - Sandboxing or containerization: Run image processing in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    - Library updates: Regularly update the `imageio` library and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Security-focused image processing: Consider using image processing libraries that are designed with security in mind or have a strong track record of security.
- Preconditions:
    - User uses the Nerfies codebase.
    - User uses a dataset that contains a maliciously crafted PNG image.
    - Nerfies code processes the malicious PNG image using `imageio.imread()`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/nerfies/image_utils.py`
    ```python
    import imageio
    def load_image(path: types.PathType) -> np.ndarray:
      """Reads an image."""
      if not isinstance(path, gpath.GPath):
        path = gpath.GPath(path)

      with path.open('rb') as f:
        return imageio.imread(f)
    ```
    - The `load_image` function in `image_utils.py` directly uses `imageio.imread()` to load images from the dataset.
    - This function is used in `/code/nerfies/datasets/nerfies.py` to load RGB images:
    ```python
    def load_rgb(self, item_id):
        return _load_image(self.rgb_dir / f'{item_id}.png')
    ```
    - The `_load_image` function in turn calls `image_utils.load_image`:
    ```python
    def _load_image(path: types.PathType) -> np.ndarray:
        path = gpath.GPath(path)
        with path.open('rb') as f:
            raw_im = np.asarray(bytearray(f.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
            image = cv2.imdecode(raw_im, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)[:, :, ::-1]  # BGR -> RGB
            image = np.asarray(image).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
            return image
    ```
    - The training and evaluation scripts (`/code/train.py` and `/code/eval.py`) use the dataset loading functionalities, thus potentially processing user-provided images via `imageio.imread()`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious PNG image file (e.g., `malicious.png`) designed to exploit a vulnerability in `imageio` or Pillow.
    2. Create a dataset directory, for example, `test_dataset`.
    3. Inside `test_dataset`, create the directory structure: `rgb/1x`.
    4. Place the `malicious.png` file in `test_dataset/rgb/1x/`.
    5. Create dummy camera and metadata files required by the Nerfies dataset format (e.g., `camera/000000.json`, `dataset.json`, `metadata.json`, `scene.json`). These files can contain minimal valid content for testing purposes. Ensure `dataset.json` and `metadata.json` point to `malicious.png` as a training image.
    6. Set the environment variable `DATASET_PATH` to the path of `test_dataset`.
    7. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_dir $DATASET_PATH --base_folder /tmp/nerfies_test --gin_configs configs/test_vrig.gin
    ```
    8. Observe the execution. Successful exploitation might manifest as a crash, unexpected program behavior, or arbitrary code execution. To confirm code execution, attempt to execute a benign command (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned`) within the malicious PNG and check if the file is created after running the training script.
