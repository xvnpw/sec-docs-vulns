- Vulnerability name: Path Traversal in Visualization Tool

- Description:
An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability in the AirDialogue visualization tool. By providing a malicious path to the `--data_path` argument of the `airdialogue vis` command, an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This is possible because the application might not properly sanitize the user-provided path before using it to access files.

Steps to trigger:
1. Run the AirDialogue visualization tool with the `airdialogue vis` command.
2. Provide a crafted `--data_path` argument that includes path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended directory.
3. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the path, it will attempt to access files based on the manipulated path.
4. An attacker can then read files outside the intended directory, including sensitive system files or application files.

- Impact:
High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to:
    - Exposure of sensitive application data, including configuration files, internal code, or data files.
    - Exposure of sensitive system files, potentially including credentials or other confidential information.
    - Further exploitation of the system based on the information gathered from reading arbitrary files.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
None. Based on the source code analysis, there is no explicit path sanitization or validation implemented for the `--data_path` argument in the visualization tool.

- Missing mitigations:
Input validation and sanitization for the `--data_path` argument are missing. Specifically, the application should:
    - Validate that the provided path is within the expected directory or a set of allowed directories.
    - Sanitize the path to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like `../` and ensure the path is canonicalized to prevent bypasses.
    - Consider using secure file access methods that restrict access based on a defined base directory.

- Preconditions:
    - The AirDialogue library must be installed, and the `airdialogue` command-line tool must be accessible.
    - The visualization tool must be running or accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide command-line arguments to the `airdialogue vis` tool, for example, if it's exposed via a web interface or a publicly accessible script.

- Source code analysis:
1. File: `/code/airdialogue/visualizer/visualizer_main.py`
    - The `main` function sets up a Flask application and defines a route `/` that calls the `wrapper` function.
    - The `wrapper` function (returned by `wrapper(FLAGS)`) is the handler for the `/` route.
    - Inside the `wrapper` function:
        - `expanded_data_path = expanduser(FLAGS.data_path)`: This line expands the user-provided `data_path` using `expanduser`. While `expanduser` resolves `~` to the user's home directory, it does not sanitize path traversal sequences like `../`.
        - `partitions = get_partitions(expanded_data_path)`: This function lists files in the `expanded_data_path`. This operation itself could be vulnerable if `expanded_data_path` is not sanitized.
        - `line_data = linecache.getline(os.path.join(expanded_data_path, "{0}_data.json".format(partition)), index)`: This line constructs a file path by joining `expanded_data_path` with the partition name and `_data.json`. If `expanded_data_path` is manipulated with path traversal sequences, `os.path.join` will simply join the paths, leading to path traversal. `linecache.getline` will then attempt to read from the potentially traversed path.
        - `line_kb = linecache.getline(os.path.join(expanded_data_path, "{0}_kb.json".format(partition)), index)`: Similar to the above line, this also constructs a file path using the potentially malicious `expanded_data_path` and reads from it.

2. File: `/code/airdialogue/visualizer/utils.py`
    - `generate_html`, `generate_kv_nested_html`, `format_simple_string`, `generate_form`, `generate_res_str`, `make_path`: These utility functions are used to generate the HTML output for visualization but do not directly handle the file path from `--data_path`.

**Visualization:**
The vulnerability lies in how `data_path` is processed in `visualizer_main.py`:
```
User input --data_path --> expanduser() --> used in os.path.join() --> linecache.getline() --> File system access
```
`expanduser()` does not sanitize path traversal. `os.path.join()` concatenates paths without sanitization. `linecache.getline()` performs file system access based on the constructed path. This chain allows path traversal if a malicious `--data_path` is provided.

- Security test case:
1. Setup:
    - Install AirDialogue library.
    - Start the visualization server: `airdialogue vis --data_path ./data/airdialogue/json/ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` (assuming the default data path and exposing it on port 8080).
    - Assume there is a sensitive file on the server, for example, `/etc/passwd` (for testing purposes, you should use a less sensitive file in a real test environment).

2. Attack:
    - As an attacker, craft a malicious `--data_path` argument that attempts to traverse to the root directory and read `/etc/passwd`. For example, use `../../../..//`.
    - Send a request to the visualization server with the crafted `data_path`. This can be done by modifying the `data_path` in the URL if the tool is exposed via web interface or by running the command line tool directly if attacker has access to the command line. For command line, you would stop the server and restart it with the malicious path:
        `airdialogue vis --data_path "../../../..// --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` (Note: command line argument parsing might differ, you may need to adjust the path to ensure it's correctly interpreted as data path)
        For web interface, if you can control the `data_path` parameter in a form, set it to `../../../..//`.
    - Access the visualization tool in a browser, e.g., `http://<server_ip>:8080`.
    - In the visualization tool, try to access any index (e.g., index 1) and any partition (e.g., train).

3. Expected outcome:
    - If the vulnerability is present, the server might attempt to read files based on the traversed path. While `linecache.getline` is meant to read lines from Python source files, in this context, it's used to read JSON data files. If the system allows reading files via this method and the path traversal is successful, you might observe errors indicating attempts to read files from unexpected locations or potentially even see content from files outside the intended directory if the tool attempts to display the content (though visualization tool expects json, so displaying `/etc/passwd` directly in a valid json format is unlikely, but errors or different behavior could indicate successful traversal).
    - A more reliable test in a controlled environment would be to place a known file within the web server's accessible directories and then try to read a file *outside* of that directory using path traversal. If successful, the tool might error out or behave unexpectedly due to invalid JSON, but the attempt to access the file outside the intended path confirms the vulnerability.

4. Remediation:
    - Implement path sanitization and validation for the `--data_path` argument as described in the "Missing mitigations" section.
