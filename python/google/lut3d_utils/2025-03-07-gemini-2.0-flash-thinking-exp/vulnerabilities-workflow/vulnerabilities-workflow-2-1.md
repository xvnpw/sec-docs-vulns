### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption and Potential for Unexpected Behavior due to Large LUT Size in .cube File
- Description:
    1. The `lut3d_utils` tool uses the `-inject_lut3d` command and the `-l` option to load a 3D LUT from a `.cube` file.
    2. The `Lut3d.read_from_cube_file` function parses the `.cube` file, including the LUT data.
    3. The tool reads the `LUT_3D_SIZE` from the `.cube` file and allocates memory to store the LUT data based on this size.
    4. While there's a check to ensure `LUT_3D_SIZE` is within the range [2, 256], the maximum size (256x256x256) can still lead to significant memory consumption.
    5. An attacker can craft a malicious `.cube` file with `LUT_3D_SIZE` set to 256 and provide a large amount of LUT data (256^3 * 3 * 4 bytes if floats, or 256^3 * 3 * 2 bytes if fixed-point shorts).
    6. If the system has limited resources, processing such a large `.cube` file might lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing performance degradation or even program termination.
    7. Furthermore, while the values are clamped in `create_prmd_contents`, the sheer volume of data processed even if clamped could still lead to unexpected delays or resource issues, which can be considered unexpected program behavior.
- Impact: Processing a maliciously crafted `.cube` file with a large LUT size can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing performance degradation or temporary unresponsiveness of the `lut3d_utils` tool. While not a critical vulnerability like remote code execution, it can disrupt the tool's intended functionality and consume system resources, leading to unexpected program behavior.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code checks if `lut3d_size` is within the range [2, 256] in `Lut3d.read_from_cube_file`. This limits the maximum LUT size, but still allows for potentially large LUTs. This check is implemented in `/code/lut3d_utils/lut3d_util.py` in the `Lut3d.read_from_cube_file` function, specifically in the section that parses the "LUT_3D_SIZE" keyword.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - There are no explicit checks on the overall file size of the `.cube` file.
    - There is no mechanism to limit the total memory consumption during `.cube` file parsing based on system resources.
    - No progress indicator or feedback during parsing of large `.cube` files to inform the user about potential delays.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to provide a malicious `.cube` file to the `lut3d_utils` tool using the `-inject_lut3d` command and the `-l` option.
    - The user must execute the `lut3d_utils` tool with the crafted `.cube` file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In the file `/code/lut3d_utils/lut3d_util.py`, the `Lut3d.read_from_cube_file` function is responsible for parsing the `.cube` file.
    - The code reads the `LUT_3D_SIZE` from the file and validates if it's within the range [2, 256].
    - ```python
      if elements[0] == "LUT_3D_SIZE" and lut3d_size < 0:
          if len(elements) != 2:
              print(f"Error: LUT_3D_SIZE shall have only one param! Line: {line}")
              return False
          lut3d_size = int(elements[1])
          if lut3d_size < 2 or lut3d_size > 256: # Mitigation: Size limit
              print(
                  "Error: LUT_3D_SIZE shall be an integer in the range of"
                  f" [2,256]. Size: {lut3d_size}"
              )
              return False
      ```
    - After determining `lut3d_size`, the code calculates the expected number of LUT entries (`lut3d_size**3`) and allocates memory to store the `lut_value` list.
    - ```python
      if len(data) != lut3d_size**3: # Validation of data size
          print(
              f"Error: The data size is not as expected. Expected: {lut3d_size}^3 ="
              f" {lut3d_size**3}, Actual: {len(data)}"
          )
          return False
      self.lut_size = lut3d_size
      self.lut_value = [data[self.shuffle_indices(i)]
                        for i in range(self.lut_size**3)] # Memory allocation for lut_value
      ```
    - Although the code validates `lut3d_size` and the number of data entries, it does not limit the total file size of the `.cube` file or the memory consumption based on system resources. A large `lut3d_size` (up to 256) can still lead to significant memory allocation and processing time.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious `.cube` file named `large_lut.cube`.
        - Set `LUT_3D_SIZE` to 256.
        - Generate 256\*256\*256 lines of valid RGB float data (e.g., "0.5 0.5 0.5"). This will create a large file.
    2. Run `lut3d_utils` to inject the LUT using the crafted file:
        ```bash
        python lut3d_utils -inject_lut3d -i input.mp4 -o output.mp4 -l large_lut.cube -p COLOUR_PRIMARIES_BT709 -t COLOUR_TRANSFER_CHARACTERISTICS_GAMMA22
        ```
        (Replace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with actual file paths. Dummy files can be used if only parsing behavior is tested).
    3. Observe the behavior of the `lut3d_utils` tool.
    4. Expected Outcome:
        - Memory usage of the `lut3d_utils` process should increase significantly.
        - Execution time should be noticeably longer.
        - On systems with limited RAM, the tool might become unresponsive or terminate due to excessive memory consumption or take a very long time to complete.
        - This test demonstrates resource consumption and potential for unexpected delays due to a large LUT size, validating the vulnerability related to uncontrolled resource consumption and potential unexpected program behavior.
