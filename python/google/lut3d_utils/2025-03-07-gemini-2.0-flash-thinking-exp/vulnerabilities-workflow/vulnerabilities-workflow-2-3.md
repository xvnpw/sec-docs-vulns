Based on the provided instructions, I need to filter the given vulnerability list. The instructions specify to exclude denial of service vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity.

The provided vulnerability is:

- Vulnerability Name: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via Large LUT Data Values in .cube File
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Impact: Denial of Service (DoS)

According to the instructions:
- **Exclude vulnerabilities that are deny of service vulnerabilities.** - This vulnerability is a DoS vulnerability.
- **Exclude vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity.** - This vulnerability is ranked as Medium, which is neither high nor critical.

Since the provided vulnerability matches the exclusion criteria for both being a DoS vulnerability and having a Medium severity rank, it should be excluded from the final list.

Therefore, the final list should be empty.
