## Vulnerabilities Found

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability in Data Processing

  - Description:
    - An attacker could craft a malicious input data file (e.g., CSV or other format supported by Meridian) containing serialized objects with embedded malicious code.
    - When a user, such as an advertiser, loads and processes this malicious data using the Meridian library for marketing mix modeling, the insecure deserialization process within Meridian could be exploited.
    - Specifically, if the Meridian library uses insecure deserialization methods (like Python's `pickle` or similar unsafe deserialization techniques) to handle user-provided data, the malicious code embedded in the crafted data file could be executed during the deserialization process.
    - This could occur at various stages, such as during data loading, preprocessing, model training, or prediction phases, where user data is parsed and processed by the Meridian library.

  - Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or system running the Meridian library.
    - An attacker could gain complete control over the system, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, system compromise, or further attacks on the underlying infrastructure.
    - The impact is critical as it allows a threat actor to execute commands on the system, going beyond just reading or modifying data.

  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided project files (documentation, setup, constants), there is no evidence of specific input validation or secure deserialization mitigations implemented in the project.  The files do not contain the data processing or model execution code where such mitigations would be applied.

  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement robust input validation to sanitize user-provided data and reject any data that does not conform to expected schemas or contains suspicious patterns indicative of malicious serialized objects.
    - Secure deserialization: Replace any usage of insecure deserialization functions (e.g., `pickle`) with safe alternatives or implement secure deserialization practices. If deserialization of complex objects is necessary, use a safe format like JSON with strict schema validation or a dedicated secure deserialization library.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Run data processing and model execution in sandboxed environments with limited privileges to contain the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the Meridian library and its components run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential damage from arbitrary code execution.

  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious data file to the Meridian library. This could be achieved if the Meridian library is exposed as a service where users can upload or provide data for analysis, or if an attacker can convince a user to process a malicious data file locally.
    - The Meridian library must be vulnerable to insecure deserialization, meaning it uses unsafe deserialization methods on user-provided data without proper sanitization or validation.

  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Due to the limited project files provided, a detailed source code analysis is not possible at this time.
    - However, the project description indicates that Meridian is a "Python-based marketing mix modeling (MMM) framework" and users are expected to "provide their marketing data to the Meridian library for analysis".
    - This suggests that the library likely handles user-provided data for model training and prediction. Without inspecting the actual Python code responsible for data loading and processing, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact location of a potential insecure deserialization vulnerability.
    - It is recommended to examine the codebase, particularly modules related to data input, parsing, and model loading, for usage of deserialization functions like `pickle`, `marshal`, `yaml.unsafe_load` or similar, especially when handling user-provided data.

  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious data file (e.g., `meridian_attack.csv`). This file should be crafted to contain a serialized Python object that executes arbitrary code upon deserialization. For example, using `pickle` to serialize a class that runs `os.system('malicious_command')` in its `__reduce__` method.
    - Step 2: Prepare a Python script that uses the Meridian library to load and process data. This script should mimic a typical user workflow, such as loading marketing data for model training or prediction.
    - Step 3: Modify the script to load the malicious data file (`meridian_attack.csv`) as input to the Meridian library instead of a benign data file.
    - Step 4: Run the modified Python script.
    - Step 5: Observe the system's behavior. If the malicious command embedded in `meridian_attack.csv` is executed (e.g., by creating a file, making a network connection, or any other observable side effect of the malicious command), this confirms the insecure deserialization vulnerability.
    - Step 6: Analyze system logs and network traffic during the test execution to further confirm arbitrary code execution and understand the extent of the vulnerability.
