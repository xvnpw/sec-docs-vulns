- Vulnerability Name: BigQuery SQL Injection
- Description:
    - An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `dataset_name` command-line parameter.
    - This parameter is used in the `check_existing_custom_data_transfers` function, which in turn calls `configure_sql` to construct BigQuery SQL queries from files located in the `sql` directory (not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming they exist).
    - The `configure_sql` function uses Python's string formatting to inject parameters, including `datasetId` derived from the user-provided `dataset_name`, directly into the SQL query strings.
    - If the SQL queries are not designed to prevent SQL injection (e.g., by using parameterized queries or proper input sanitization) and directly use the `{datasetId}` placeholder in a vulnerable context, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    - For example, if an SQL query in a file uses the dataset name in the `FROM` clause like `SELECT * FROM {datasetId}.products`, and an attacker provides a `dataset_name` like `mydataset; malicious SQL code --`, the resulting query might become `SELECT * FROM mydataset; malicious SQL code --.products`. This injected code could perform unauthorized actions on the BigQuery database.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker identifies that the application takes `dataset_name` as a command-line argument.
        2. The attacker crafts a malicious `dataset_name` string containing SQL injection payload. For example: `mydataset;DROP TABLE your_project_id:yourdataset.your_table;--`.
        3. The attacker executes the `main.py` script providing the crafted malicious `dataset_name` as the `-d` parameter.
        4. The `main.py` script proceeds to use this `dataset_name` to construct BigQuery SQL queries.
        5. If the SQL queries in the `sql` directory are vulnerable to SQL injection through the `{datasetId}` placeholder, the injected SQL code will be executed in the BigQuery context.
- Impact:
    - Successful SQL injection can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the BigQuery dataset.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of data within the BigQuery dataset.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Potential to leverage compromised database access to gain further access within the Google Cloud Project, depending on the permissions of the service account used by the application.
        - **Denial of Service (indirect):**  While not a direct DoS vulnerability of the application itself, malicious SQL queries could overload the BigQuery service, leading to performance degradation or service disruption for legitimate users.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any explicit input sanitization or validation for the `dataset_name` parameter, nor does it utilize parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection in the `configure_sql` function. The string formatting used in `configure_sql` is inherently vulnerable if the SQL templates are not carefully designed to avoid injection.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `dataset_name` parameter. This should include:
        - Validating that the `dataset_name` conforms to the expected format (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores).
        - Rejecting any input that contains suspicious characters or SQL keywords that could be part of an injection attack.
    - **Parameterized Queries:** Refactor the SQL query construction process to use parameterized queries instead of string formatting. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection as it separates SQL code from user-provided data, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not executable code. The BigQuery client library in Python supports parameterized queries.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the service account or credentials used by the application to interact with BigQuery have the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `main.py` script and provide command-line arguments.
    - The application must be configured to use SQL queries from files (assumed to be in the `sql` directory) that are vulnerable to SQL injection through the `{datasetId}` placeholder when formatted using `configure_sql`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `main.py:129`: The `main` function uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `--dataset` which is assigned to the `dataset_name` variable.
    - `main.py:150`: The `check_existing_custom_data_transfers` function is called, passing `dataset_name` as an argument.
    - `main.py:280`: In `check_existing_custom_data_transfers`, the `configure_sql` function is called with `os.path.join('sql', job)` as the SQL file path and `params_replace` as query parameters.
    - `main.py:302`: The `configure_sql` function reads the SQL file content and then uses `sql_script.format(**params)` to replace placeholders in the SQL query with values from the `params` dictionary.
    - `main.py:305`: The `params_replace` dictionary is created, and it includes `'datasetId': dataset_name`, directly using the user-provided `dataset_name` without any sanitization.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (dataset_name) --> main() --> check_existing_custom_data_transfers() --> configure_sql() --> SQL Query Construction (using .format) --> BigQuery Execution (potential SQL Injection)
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a Google Cloud Project with BigQuery enabled.
        - Create a BigQuery dataset (e.g., `test_dataset`).
        - Create a `client_secret.json` file in the `/code` directory for authentication.
        - Assume there is a file `sql/product_coverage.sql` with the following vulnerable content:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM {datasetId}.product_table LIMIT 10
          ```
        - Ensure a table named `product_table` exists in the `test_dataset` for testing purposes, or create a dummy table.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the `main.py` script with a malicious `dataset_name` designed to inject SQL code. For example, to attempt to list tables in the project, use:
          ```bash
          python main.py -p your_project_id -m your_merchant_id -r your_region -d "`; SELECT table_id FROM your_project_id.__TABLES__ --`" -l en-US -c US -e 7
          ```
          Replace `your_project_id`, `your_merchant_id`, and `your_region` with your actual GCP project details.
        - Alternatively, to attempt to cause an error and confirm injection, try:
          ```bash
          python main.py -p your_project_id -m your_merchant_id -r your_region -d "`; SELECT SLEEP(10) --`" -l en-US -c US -e 7
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Check BigQuery Logs:** Examine the BigQuery job execution logs for the project. Look for the executed SQL queries. If the injected SQL code (e.g., `SELECT table_id FROM ...` or `SELECT SLEEP(10)`) is present in the executed queries, it confirms SQL injection.
        - **Observe Application Behavior:** In the first example (table listing), the application might behave differently or output information related to table IDs if the injection is successful (though this script might not directly expose such output). In the second example (SLEEP), if the application takes significantly longer to execute (e.g., 10+ seconds), it suggests the `SLEEP(10)` command was successfully injected and executed in BigQuery.
        - **Error Messages:** Look for any error messages in the application output or BigQuery logs that might indicate unexpected SQL execution or syntax errors resulting from the injected code.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can potentially inject SQL code through the `dataset_name` parameter and confirms the presence of a BigQuery SQL injection vulnerability due to insecure string formatting in SQL query construction.
