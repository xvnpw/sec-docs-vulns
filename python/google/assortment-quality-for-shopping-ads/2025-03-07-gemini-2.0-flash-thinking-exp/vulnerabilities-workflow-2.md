## Vulnerability Report

This report summarizes identified vulnerabilities, detailing their descriptions, impacts, mitigations, and steps to reproduce and verify them.

### 1. BigQuery SQL Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** BigQuery SQL Injection
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `dataset_name` command-line parameter.
    - This parameter is used in the `check_existing_custom_data_transfers` function, which in turn calls `configure_sql` to construct BigQuery SQL queries from files located in the `sql` directory (not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming they exist).
    - The `configure_sql` function uses Python's string formatting to inject parameters, including `datasetId` derived from the user-provided `dataset_name`, directly into the SQL query strings.
    - If the SQL queries are not designed to prevent SQL injection (e.g., by using parameterized queries or proper input sanitization) and directly use the `{datasetId}` placeholder in a vulnerable context, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    - For example, if an SQL query in a file uses the dataset name in the `FROM` clause like `SELECT * FROM {datasetId}.products`, and an attacker provides a `dataset_name` like `mydataset; malicious SQL code --`, the resulting query might become `SELECT * FROM mydataset; malicious SQL code --.products`. This injected code could perform unauthorized actions on the BigQuery database.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker identifies that the application takes `dataset_name` as a command-line argument.
        2. The attacker crafts a malicious `dataset_name` string containing SQL injection payload. For example: `mydataset;DROP TABLE your_project_id:yourdataset.your_table;--`.
        3. The attacker executes the `main.py` script providing the crafted malicious `dataset_name` as the `-d` parameter.
        4. The `main.py` script proceeds to use this `dataset_name` to construct BigQuery SQL queries.
        5. If the SQL queries in the `sql` directory are vulnerable to SQL injection through the `{datasetId}` placeholder, the injected SQL code will be executed in the BigQuery context.
- **Impact:**
    - Successful SQL injection can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the BigQuery dataset.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of data within the BigQuery dataset.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Potential to leverage compromised database access to gain further access within the Google Cloud Project, depending on the permissions of the service account used by the application.
        - **Denial of Service (indirect):**  While not a direct DoS vulnerability of the application itself, malicious SQL queries could overload the BigQuery service, leading to performance degradation or service disruption for legitimate users.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code does not include any explicit input sanitization or validation for the `dataset_name` parameter, nor does it utilize parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection in the `configure_sql` function. The string formatting used in `configure_sql` is inherently vulnerable if the SQL templates are not carefully designed to avoid injection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `dataset_name` parameter. This should include:
        - Validating that the `dataset_name` conforms to the expected format (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores).
        - Rejecting any input that contains suspicious characters or SQL keywords that could be part of an injection attack.
    - **Parameterized Queries:** Refactor the SQL query construction process to use parameterized queries instead of string formatting. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection as it separates SQL code from user-provided data, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not executable code. The BigQuery client library in Python supports parameterized queries.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the service account or credentials used by the application to interact with BigQuery have the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `main.py` script and provide command-line arguments.
    - The application must be configured to use SQL queries from files (assumed to be in the `sql` directory) that are vulnerable to SQL injection through the `{datasetId}` placeholder when formatted using `configure_sql`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `main.py:129`: The `main` function uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `--dataset` which is assigned to the `dataset_name` variable.
    - `main.py:150`: The `check_existing_custom_data_transfers` function is called, passing `dataset_name` as an argument.
    - `main.py:280`: In `check_existing_custom_data_transfers`, the `configure_sql` function is called with `os.path.join('sql', job)` as the SQL file path and `params_replace` as query parameters.
    - `main.py:302`: The `configure_sql` function reads the SQL file content and then uses `sql_script.format(**params)` to replace placeholders in the SQL query with values from the `params` dictionary.
    - `main.py:305`: The `params_replace` dictionary is created, and it includes `'datasetId': dataset_name`, directly using the user-provided `dataset_name` without any sanitization.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (dataset_name) --> main() --> check_existing_custom_data_transfers() --> configure_sql() --> SQL Query Construction (using .format) --> BigQuery Execution (potential SQL Injection)
        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a Google Cloud Project with BigQuery enabled.
        - Create a BigQuery dataset (e.g., `test_dataset`).
        - Create a `client_secret.json` file in the `/code` directory for authentication.
        - Assume there is a file `sql/product_coverage.sql` with the following vulnerable content:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM {datasetId}.product_table LIMIT 10
          ```
        - Ensure a table named `product_table` exists in the `test_dataset` for testing purposes, or create a dummy table.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the `main.py` script with a malicious `dataset_name` designed to inject SQL code. For example, to attempt to list tables in the project, use:
          ```bash
          python main.py -p your_project_id -m your_merchant_id -r your_region -d "`; SELECT table_id FROM your_project_id.__TABLES__ --`" -l en-US -c US -e 7
          ```
          Replace `your_project_id`, `your_merchant_id`, and `your_region` with your actual GCP project details.
        - Alternatively, to attempt to cause an error and confirm injection, try:
          ```bash
          python main.py -p your_project_id -m your_merchant_id -r your_region -d "`; SELECT SLEEP(10) --`" -l en-US -c US -e 7
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Check BigQuery Logs:** Examine the BigQuery job execution logs for the project. Look for the executed SQL queries. If the injected SQL code (e.g., `SELECT table_id FROM ...` or `SELECT SLEEP(10)`) is present in the executed queries, it confirms SQL injection.
        - **Observe Application Behavior:** In the first example (table listing), the application might behave differently or output information related to table IDs if the injection is successful (though this script might not directly expose such output). In the second example (SLEEP), if the application takes significantly longer to execute (e.g., 10+ seconds), it suggests the `SLEEP(10)` command was successfully injected and executed in BigQuery.
        - **Error Messages:** Look for any error messages in the application output or BigQuery logs that might indicate unexpected SQL execution or syntax errors resulting from the injected code.

### 2. Command Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection
- **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands through unsanitized command-line arguments provided to the `main.py` script. If the script improperly handles these inputs in system calls (e.g., using `os.system`, `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`) without proper sanitization or parameterization, the injected commands could be executed on the server.
    - **Step-by-step:**
        1. Attacker identifies that the `main.py` script accepts command-line arguments to control its functionality.
        2. Attacker crafts malicious command-line arguments containing shell commands, designed to be executed by the system.
        3. Attacker executes the `main.py` script, providing the crafted malicious arguments.
        4. If `main.py` uses these arguments in a system call (e.g., using `subprocess.run(user_provided_arg, shell=True)`) without proper input sanitization, the injected commands are executed by the system shell.
- **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This can lead to:
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to sensitive data, configuration files, and internal systems.
    * **Data Breach:** Stealing sensitive information, including Google Cloud credentials, product data, or user information.
    * **System Takeover:**  Modifying system configurations, installing backdoors, or taking complete control of the server and potentially the connected Google Cloud environment.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the application's functionality or the entire server.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** No mitigations are explicitly described in the provided text. It is assumed that no input sanitization or safe command execution practices are currently implemented for command-line arguments used in system calls.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all command-line arguments that are used in system calls. This includes validating and escaping special characters that could be interpreted by the shell.
    * **Parameterized Queries / Safe API Usage:**  Avoid using shell=True in `subprocess.run` when possible. If system commands need to be executed, use parameterized queries or safer alternatives that do not involve direct shell interpretation of user inputs. For example, pass arguments as a list to `subprocess.run` instead of constructing shell commands from strings.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of successful command injection.
    * **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on input handling and system call implementations.
- **Preconditions:**
    * The `main.py` script must accept command-line arguments that influence system calls.
    * The application must be deployed in an environment where an attacker can execute the `main.py` script with arbitrary command-line arguments, or there is a way for an attacker to influence the arguments passed to the script (e.g., through a web interface if the application is exposed via web).
- **Source code analysis:**
    - To illustrate the vulnerability, consider a simplified example of potentially vulnerable code in `main.py`:
    ```python
    import subprocess
    import sys

    def main():
        product_name = sys.argv[1] # User-provided command line argument
        command = f"echo Processing product: {product_name}" # Imagine this command is more complex and interacts with the system
        subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True) # Vulnerable line: shell=True and unsanitized input

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    - In this example:
        1. `sys.argv[1]` retrieves the first command-line argument provided by the user.
        2. `command` string is constructed by directly embedding the `product_name` into a shell command.
        3. `subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True)` executes the constructed command using a shell (`shell=True`).
    - If an attacker provides a malicious `product_name` like `"; touch injected.txt #"`, the constructed command becomes:
    `echo Processing product: "; touch injected.txt #"`
    - Because `shell=True` is used, the shell interprets the semicolon `;` as a command separator.  Thus, it will execute:
        1. `echo Processing product: "` (which might fail or print partially).
        2. `touch injected.txt` (which creates a file named `injected.txt`).
        3. `#"` (which is treated as a comment).
    - This demonstrates how arbitrary commands (`touch injected.txt` in this case) can be injected and executed due to unsanitized input and the use of `shell=True`. In a real application, the injected commands could be far more damaging.
- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the `main.py` script (or a similar vulnerable script that takes command-line arguments and uses them in system calls with `shell=True`) available in a test environment.
    2. **Execution:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
    3. **Inject Malicious Command:** Execute the script with a command-line argument designed to inject a simple, harmless command. For example:
       ```bash
       python main.py "$(touch injected.txt)"
       ```
       or, more directly if arguments are not escaped by the shell:
       ```bash
       python main.py "; touch injected.txt #"
       ```
    4. **Verification:** Check if the file `injected.txt` has been created in the same directory where you executed the script.
    5. **Confirmation:** If `injected.txt` is created, this confirms that command injection is possible. The injected command `touch injected.txt` was successfully executed by the system due to the vulnerability in `main.py`.

### 3. SQL Injection in Scheduled Queries

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in Scheduled Queries
- **Description:** The application constructs BigQuery Scheduled Queries using user-provided command-line arguments such as `project_id`, `gmc_id`, `dataset_name`, `language`, and `country`. These arguments are used to format SQL queries read from files in the `sql` directory. If these arguments are not properly sanitized or escaped before being incorporated into the SQL queries, a malicious user could inject arbitrary SQL code by providing crafted command-line arguments. This injected SQL code would then be executed within the BigQuery environment when the scheduled query runs, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification within the user's Google Cloud project.
- **Impact:** Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to data within the BigQuery dataset.
    - Modify or delete data within the BigQuery dataset.
    - Potentially escalate privileges within the BigQuery environment depending on the permissions of the service account used by the scheduled queries.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None observed in the provided code. The code directly formats the SQL queries using the user-provided arguments without any apparent sanitization or escaping.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input sanitization:** All command-line arguments that are used in SQL query construction should be properly sanitized or escaped to prevent SQL injection. Libraries or built-in functions for SQL parameterization should be used to safely incorporate user inputs into SQL queries.
    - **Input validation:** Input validation should be implemented to ensure that the provided command-line arguments conform to expected formats and values. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious inputs from being processed.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** The service account or credentials used by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service and Scheduled Queries should be granted only the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. This limits the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute the `main.py` script with crafted command-line arguments.
    - The application must be vulnerable to SQL injection, meaning the SQL queries are constructed without proper sanitization of user inputs.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `main` function in `main.py` parses command-line arguments using `argparse`.
    2. The `check_existing_custom_data_transfers` function is called, which in turn calls `configure_sql`.
    3. The `configure_sql` function reads SQL queries from files (e.g., `brand_coverage.sql`) located in the `sql` directory and formats them using `sql_script.format(**params_replace)`. The `params_replace` dictionary contains user-provided arguments like `project_id`, `gmcId`, `datasetId`, `language`, and `country`.
    4. The formatted SQL query is then used in the `create_scheduled_query` function within the `body` dictionary under the `'params': {'query': query_view}` key.
    5. The `create_scheduled_query` function creates a BigQuery Scheduled Query using the provided SQL query.

    - If the SQL files (e.g., `brand_coverage.sql`) directly use format placeholders `{language}` or `{country}` without any sanitization, then a SQL injection vulnerability exists. For example, if `brand_coverage.sql` contains a query like:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE language = '{language}' AND country = '{country}';
    ```
    - and a user provides `--language "en-US' OR '1'='1"` and `--country "US"`, the formatted SQL query becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE language = 'en-US' OR '1'='1' AND country = 'US';
    ```
    - This injected SQL code `' OR '1'='1'` would bypass the intended language filter and potentially expose all data from the `products` table.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare environment:**
        - Have a Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled.
        - Have a Google Merchant Center account ID.
        - Set up the application as described in the README.md, including `client_secret.json`.
    2. **Execute the `main.py` script with a crafted `--language` argument to attempt SQL injection. For example, using a simple SQL injection payload that always evaluates to true:**
       ```bash
       python main.py -p <your_project_id> -m <your_merchant_id> -r us-central1 -d <your_dataset_name> -l "en-US' OR '1'='1" -c "US" -e 7
       ```
       Replace `<your_project_id>`, `<your_merchant_id>`, and `<your_dataset_name>` with your actual Google Cloud project ID, Merchant Center ID, and desired BigQuery dataset name.
    3. **Check the created BigQuery Scheduled Queries in the Google Cloud Console. Navigate to BigQuery -> Data Transfers -> Scheduled Queries.**
    4. **Find the scheduled query that corresponds to the execution with the injected `--language` parameter. The display name should reflect the parameters used, including the injected language.**
    5. **Examine the SQL query of the scheduled query. Verify if the injected SQL code `' OR '1'='1'` is present in the query. You can typically view the query details by clicking on the scheduled query in the BigQuery Data Transfers UI.**
    6. **If the injected SQL code is present in the scheduled query, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability. This indicates that user-provided input is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper sanitization.**
    7. **To further validate the impact, you would need to examine the actual SQL queries in the `sql` directory (e.g., `brand_coverage.sql`, `category_coverage.sql`, etc.) to understand how the `language` and `country` parameters are used and what data could be potentially accessed or modified through SQL injection. If the queries are designed to filter or manipulate data based on these parameters, successful injection could lead to data breaches or manipulation.**
