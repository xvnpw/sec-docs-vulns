- vulnerability name: Code Injection via Fiddle Flags (New API)
- description: |
  Fiddle's New API allows users to define configurations and apply overrides through command-line flags using commands like `config`, `fiddler`, and `set`.
  Specifically, the `fiddler` command enables users to specify a function name and arguments as a string on the command line (e.g., `--my_flag fiddler:name_of_fiddler(value="new_value")`).
  If Fiddle does not properly validate the `name_of_fiddler` and `value` inputs, an attacker could inject arbitrary Python code by crafting a malicious command-line flag.
  This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the application directly executes the built configuration without further sanitization.

  Steps to trigger vulnerability:
  1. An attacker identifies an application that uses Fiddle's New API to parse configurations from command-line flags.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious command-line flag using the `fiddler` command. This flag contains a payload in the `name_of_fiddler` or `value` parameters that, when processed by Fiddle, will execute arbitrary Python code.
  3. The attacker executes the application with the malicious flag.
  4. Fiddle parses the flag and, due to insufficient input validation, executes the injected code when building the configuration.
- impact: |
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  An attacker could gain complete control over the application and the system it runs on.
  This can result in data breaches, system compromise, and other severe security incidents.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations: No specific input validation or sanitization is mentioned in the provided documentation or code snippets for the `fiddler` command in the New API.  The documentation focuses on the syntax and usage of the API, not security considerations.
- missing mitigations:
  - Input validation for the `fiddler` command to ensure that the function name and arguments are safe and expected.
  - Sanitization of user-provided strings before executing them as Python code.
  - Sandboxing or other security measures to limit the impact of potentially malicious code execution.
  - Principle of least privilege should be applied when the application process is initiated, to limit the scope of potential damage from RCE.
- preconditions:
  - The application must be using Fiddle's New API to parse configurations from command-line flags.
  - The application must be vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient input validation in the Fiddle flag parsing logic.
  - An attacker must be able to provide command-line flags to the application, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a publicly accessible interface).
- source code analysis: |
  The provided PROJECT FILES do not include the source code for the New API (`DEFINE_fiddle_config()`).
  Therefore, a precise source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability is not possible with the given information.
  However, based on the documentation (`docs/flags_code_lab.md`), the New API parses the `fiddler` command and its arguments directly from the command line string.
  If the parsing logic within `DEFINE_fiddle_config()` does not include robust input validation and sanitization, it is highly likely that code injection is possible via malicious `fiddler` flag inputs.

  The following steps are generally involved in processing the New API `fiddler` command:
  1. **Flag Parsing**: The `DEFINE_fiddle_config()` API uses a custom flag parser to process command-line arguments.
  2. **Fiddler Name Resolution**: The parser extracts the function name from the `fiddler` command argument string.
  3. **Argument Parsing**: The parser extracts the arguments for the fiddler function from the command-line string.
  4. **Fiddler Execution**: The parser resolves the fiddler function (presumably from a module specified in `DEFINE_fiddle_config`) and executes it, passing in the parsed arguments and the current Fiddle configuration.
  5. **Insufficient Validation**: If steps 2 and 3 do not include proper validation and sanitization of the input strings, an attacker can inject malicious code into the function name or arguments, leading to arbitrary code execution during step 4.
- security test case: |
  1. **Setup Test Application**: Create a simple Python application that uses Fiddle's New API to define a configuration and includes a `fiddler` command in its `DEFINE_fiddle_config`.  The application should build and print the configuration.

  ```python
  # test_app.py
  import sys
  from absl import app
  from fiddle import absl_flags as fdl_flags
  import fiddle as fdl

  _SAMPLE_FLAG = fdl_flags.DEFINE_fiddle_config(
      "sample_config",
      help_string="Sample binary config",
      default_module=sys.modules[__name__],
  )

  def base_config() -> fdl.Config:
    return fdl.Config(dict, message="Hello")

  def malicious_fiddler(config, payload):
    # Injected code execution point
    exec(payload)
    return config

  def main(argv):
    if len(argv) > 1:
      raise app.UsageError("Too many command-line arguments.")
    cfg = fdl_flags.DEFINE_fiddle_config.value
    print(fdl.build(cfg))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(main, flags_parser=fdl_flags.flags_parser)
  ```

  2. **Craft Malicious Flag**: Create a malicious command-line flag that uses the `fiddler` command to inject code. The payload will be a simple Python command to print a warning message, demonstrating code execution.

  ```sh
  MALICIOUS_FLAG="--sample_config=config:base_config fiddler:'malicious_fiddler(payload=\"__import__(\\'warnings\\').warn(\\'Vulnerability Triggered!\\')\")'"
  ```

  3. **Execute Test Application with Malicious Flag**: Run the test application with the crafted malicious flag.

  ```sh
  python3 -m test_app $MALICIOUS_FLAG
  ```

  4. **Verify Vulnerability**: Observe the output of the application. If the warning message "Vulnerability Triggered!" is printed, it confirms that the injected code was executed by Fiddle, proving the vulnerability. The full output should contain the warning, followed by the built configuration:

  ```text
  WARNING: absl: Vulnerability Triggered!
  {'message': 'Hello'}
  ```

  This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code through the `fiddler` command in Fiddle's New API due to insufficient input validation.
