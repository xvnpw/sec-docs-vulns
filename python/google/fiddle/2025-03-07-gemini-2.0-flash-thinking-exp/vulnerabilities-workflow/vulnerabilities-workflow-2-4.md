- **Vulnerability name:** Arbitrary Python Code Execution via Malicious Configuration File
- **Description:** If Fiddle allows for the execution of arbitrary Python code within its configuration files and a user loads a configuration from an untrusted source, an attacker could inject and execute malicious Python code by crafting a malicious configuration file. An attacker crafts a malicious Fiddle configuration file. This file is designed to include Python code that, when executed, performs actions defined by the attacker. The victim, unknowingly or through social engineering, loads this malicious configuration file using Fiddle. Fiddle, upon processing the configuration file, executes the embedded malicious Python code.
- **Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the system where the Fiddle configuration is loaded. This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including but not limited to: data theft, installation of malware, complete system compromise, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. The severity is critical as it allows for full control over the affected system.
- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None mentioned in the description. It is assumed that Fiddle, by design, allows execution of Python code within configurations without explicit sandboxing or security boundaries.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of configuration files to prevent injection of malicious code.
    - Sandboxing or secure execution environments for processing configuration files to limit the impact of executed code.
    -  Mechanisms to warn users when loading configurations from untrusted sources, highlighting the potential risks of arbitrary code execution.
    - Principle of least privilege applied to the execution of configuration code, limiting the permissions available to the configuration processing engine.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have Fiddle installed and be using it to load configuration files.
    - The user must load a configuration file from an untrusted source controlled by the attacker.
    - Fiddle must be designed to execute Python code embedded within its configuration files without sufficient security measures.
- **Source code analysis:** To confirm this vulnerability, a source code analysis of Fiddle is required. Specifically, one would need to examine how Fiddle parses and processes configuration files. Look for areas where:
    1.  Fiddle reads and interprets configuration files.
    2.  The configuration file format allows embedding of Python code or instructions that are interpreted as code.
    3.  Fiddle utilizes functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, `pickle.load()`, or similar mechanisms that can lead to arbitrary code execution when processing untrusted input.

    **Hypothetical Code Flow (Illustrative):**

    ```python
    # Hypothetical vulnerable code snippet within Fiddle

    def load_config(config_file_path):
        with open(config_file_path, 'r') as f:
            config_data = json.load(f) # or yaml.load, or custom format
            for key, value in config_data.items():
                if isinstance(value, str) and value.startswith("!python/"): # Hypothetical marker for python code
                    python_code = value[len("!python/"):]
                    exec(python_code) # Vulnerable point: execution of arbitrary code
                # ... rest of configuration processing ...
    ```

    In this hypothetical example, if Fiddle processes configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, or a custom format) and interprets certain strings as Python code using `exec()`, it becomes vulnerable. An attacker could craft a configuration file with malicious Python code embedded within such strings.

- **Security test case:**
    1.  **Attacker Action:** Create a malicious Fiddle configuration file (e.g., `malicious_config.json`). This file should contain embedded Python code designed to execute a simple but observable malicious action, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory (if permissions allow) or making a network request to an attacker-controlled server.

        ```json
        // malicious_config.json
        {
          "param1": "value1",
          "malicious_code": "!python/import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')"
        }
        ```

    2.  **Victim Action:**  The victim, using Fiddle, loads the `malicious_config.json` file. This could be through a command-line interface or within a Python script using Fiddle's API.

        ```python
        # Victim's Python script (hypothetical)
        import fiddle as fdl

        config = fdl.build(fdl.Config(path_to_config='malicious_config.json')) # Hypothetical Fiddle API for loading config
        # ... rest of the application logic ...
        ```

    3.  **Verification:** After the victim loads and processes the configuration, the attacker checks for the execution of the malicious code. In this test case, the attacker checks if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the victim's system. If the file exists, it confirms that arbitrary Python code execution is possible.  Alternatively, if the malicious code was designed to make a network request, the attacker would monitor their server logs for an incoming connection from the victim's system.

    **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the malicious Python code embedded in `malicious_config.json` will be executed when the victim loads the configuration file using Fiddle, leading to the creation of the `/tmp/pwned` file (or other malicious actions defined in the test case). This demonstrates successful arbitrary code execution.
