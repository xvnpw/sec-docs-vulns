## Combined Vulnerability Report

### Vulnerability 1: Code Injection via Fiddle Flags (New API)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Code Injection via Fiddle Flags (New API)
- **Description:**
  Fiddle's New API allows users to define configurations and apply overrides through command-line flags using commands like `config`, `fiddler`, and `set`. Specifically, the `fiddler` command enables users to specify a function name and arguments as a string on the command line (e.g., `--my_flag fiddler:name_of_fiddler(value="new_value")`). If Fiddle does not properly validate the `name_of_fiddler` and `value` inputs, an attacker could inject arbitrary Python code by crafting a malicious command-line flag. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the application directly executes the built configuration without further sanitization.

  **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
  1. An attacker identifies an application that uses Fiddle's New API to parse configurations from command-line flags.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious command-line flag using the `fiddler` command. This flag contains a payload in the `name_of_fiddler` or `value` parameters that, when processed by Fiddle, will execute arbitrary Python code.
  3. The attacker executes the application with the malicious flag.
  4. Fiddle parses the flag and, due to insufficient input validation, executes the injected code when building the configuration.
- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could gain complete control over the application and the system it runs on. This can result in data breaches, system compromise, and other severe security incidents.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** No specific input validation or sanitization is mentioned in the provided documentation or code snippets for the `fiddler` command in the New API.  The documentation focuses on the syntax and usage of the API, not security considerations.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input validation for the `fiddler` command to ensure that the function name and arguments are safe and expected.
  - Sanitization of user-provided strings before executing them as Python code.
  - Sandboxing or other security measures to limit the impact of potentially malicious code execution.
  - Principle of least privilege should be applied when the application process is initiated, to limit the scope of potential damage from RCE.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The application must be using Fiddle's New API to parse configurations from command-line flags.
  - The application must be vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient input validation in the Fiddle flag parsing logic.
  - An attacker must be able to provide command-line flags to the application, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a publicly accessible interface).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  The provided PROJECT FILES do not include the source code for the New API (`DEFINE_fiddle_config()`). Therefore, a precise source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability is not possible with the given information. However, based on the documentation (`docs/flags_code_lab.md`), the New API parses the `fiddler` command and its arguments directly from the command line string. If the parsing logic within `DEFINE_fiddle_config()` does not include robust input validation and sanitization, it is highly likely that code injection is possible via malicious `fiddler` flag inputs.

  The following steps are generally involved in processing the New API `fiddler` command:
  1. **Flag Parsing**: The `DEFINE_fiddle_config()` API uses a custom flag parser to process command-line arguments.
  2. **Fiddler Name Resolution**: The parser extracts the function name from the `fiddler` command argument string.
  3. **Argument Parsing**: The parser extracts the arguments for the fiddler function from the command-line string.
  4. **Fiddler Execution**: The parser resolves the fiddler function (presumably from a module specified in `DEFINE_fiddle_config`) and executes it, passing in the parsed arguments and the current Fiddle configuration.
  5. **Insufficient Validation**: If steps 2 and 3 do not include proper validation and sanitization of the input strings, an attacker can inject malicious code into the function name or arguments, leading to arbitrary code execution during step 4.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup Test Application**: Create a simple Python application that uses Fiddle's New API to define a configuration and includes a `fiddler` command in its `DEFINE_fiddle_config`.  The application should build and print the configuration.

  ```python
  # test_app.py
  import sys
  from absl import app
  from fiddle import absl_flags as fdl_flags
  import fiddle as fdl

  _SAMPLE_FLAG = fdl_flags.DEFINE_fiddle_config(
      "sample_config",
      help_string="Sample binary config",
      default_module=sys.modules[__name__],
  )

  def base_config() -> fdl.Config:
    return fdl.Config(dict, message="Hello")

  def malicious_fiddler(config, payload):
    # Injected code execution point
    exec(payload)
    return config

  def main(argv):
    if len(argv) > 1:
      raise app.UsageError("Too many command-line arguments.")
    cfg = fdl_flags.DEFINE_fiddle_config.value
    print(fdl.build(cfg))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(main, flags_parser=fdl_flags.flags_parser)
  ```

  2. **Craft Malicious Flag**: Create a malicious command-line flag that uses the `fiddler` command to inject code. The payload will be a simple Python command to print a warning message, demonstrating code execution.

  ```sh
  MALICIOUS_FLAG="--sample_config=config:base_config fiddler:'malicious_fiddler(payload=\"__import__(\\'warnings\\').warn(\\'Vulnerability Triggered!\\')\")'"
  ```

  3. **Execute Test Application with Malicious Flag**: Run the test application with the crafted malicious flag.

  ```sh
  python3 -m test_app $MALICIOUS_FLAG
  ```

  4. **Verify Vulnerability**: Observe the output of the application. If the warning message "Vulnerability Triggered!" is printed, it confirms that the injected code was executed by Fiddle, proving the vulnerability. The full output should contain the warning, followed by the built configuration:

  ```text
  WARNING: absl: Vulnerability Triggered!
  {'message': 'Hello'}
  ```

  This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code through the `fiddler` command in Fiddle's New API due to insufficient input validation.

### Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Fiddle Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Fiddle Configuration
- **Description:**
    An attacker crafts a malicious YAML configuration file or string. This malicious configuration contains a `!fdl.Config` or `!fdl.Partial` tag with the `__fn_or_cls__` key pointing to a malicious Python function. The attacker provides this configuration file or string to an application that uses Fiddle to load and process configurations, for example, via command-line flags using `DEFINE_fiddle_config` or `create_buildable_from_flags`. When the application parses the configuration using Fiddle's YAML loading or flag parsing mechanisms, Fiddle attempts to resolve the function specified by `__fn_or_cls__`. Due to `yaml.unsafe_load` and `exec` being used in Fiddle's flag parsing and YAML loading functionalities, if the attacker-controlled configuration is processed, the malicious Python code within `__fn_or_cls__` gets executed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

  **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML file containing `!fdl.Config` or `!fdl.Partial` tags with a malicious function specified in `__fn_or_cls__`.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious YAML file to a Fiddle-based application through a configuration loading mechanism, such as command-line flags or file input.
    3. The application uses Fiddle to load and parse the YAML configuration, potentially using `yaml.unsafe_load`.
    4. Fiddle, upon encountering the `!fdl.Config` or `!fdl.Partial` tag, attempts to resolve and execute the function specified in `__fn_or_cls__`.
    5. The malicious function, controlled by the attacker, is executed within the application's context, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:**
    Critical: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could gain complete control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation of the configuration source to ensure it originates from a trusted source.
    - Secure YAML loading: Replace `yaml.unsafe_load` with `yaml.safe_load` to prevent arbitrary code execution during YAML parsing. However, `yaml.safe_load` might not support all Fiddle's YAML features, so a more robust solution might involve a custom YAML loader that specifically handles Fiddle tags securely.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If dynamic configuration loading from untrusted sources is a core requirement, consider sandboxing or isolating the Fiddle configuration processing to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Code review: Thoroughly review the code paths involved in configuration loading, especially the flag parsing and YAML loading functionalities, to identify and eliminate any other potential code injection points.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must use Fiddle's flag parsing (`DEFINE_fiddle_config`, `create_buildable_from_flags`) or YAML loading capabilities to load configurations.
    - The application must load configuration from an untrusted source (e.g., command-line arguments, user-provided files, network sources).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/docs/flags_code_lab.md`: Documents the usage of Fiddle flags, highlighting the potential risk if configuration is loaded from untrusted sources. It mentions both "New API" (`DEFINE_fiddle_config`) and "Legacy API" (`create_buildable_from_flags`) as potential attack vectors.
    - File: `/code/fiddle/_src/absl_flags/utils.py`: The `ZlibJSONSerializer.deserialize` method, used to deserialize configurations from strings or files via flags, utilizes `serialization.load_json`, which in turn uses `yaml.unsafe_load`. The `resolve_function_reference` function dynamically resolves function names from strings in flags, posing a risk when combined with untrusted sources.
    - File: `/code/fiddle/_src/experimental/serialization.py`: The `load_json` function uses `yaml.unsafe_load` to deserialize YAML, called by `ZlibJSONSerializer.deserialize`, making it a key part of the attack vector.
    - File: `/code/fiddle/_src/experimental/testdata/yaml_serialization_diamond.yaml`: Demonstrates YAML serialization/deserialization with Fiddle, including `!fdl.Config` tags, processed by `yaml.unsafe_load`, vulnerable to code injection if exposed to untrusted input.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious YAML file named `evil_config.yaml` with the following content:
    ```yaml
    !fdl.Config
    __fn_or_cls__:
      module: os
      name: system
    command: "touch /tmp/pwned"
    ```
    2. Create a Python application `test_fiddle_app.py` that uses `DEFINE_fiddle_config` to load configuration and build it:
    ```python
    import fiddle as fdl
    from fiddle import absl_flags
    from absl import app
    import os

    _CONFIG = fdl_flags.DEFINE_fiddle_config(
        name="config", help_string="Fiddle configuration."
    )

    def main(_):
      cfg = _CONFIG.value
      fdl.build(cfg)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(main)
    ```
    3. Run the application, providing the malicious YAML file via command-line flag:
    ```sh
    python3 test_fiddle_app.py --config=config_file:evil_config.yaml
    ```
    4. After running the application, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, it confirms successful arbitrary code execution.
