### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Uncontrolled Output Bucket leading to Potential Data Exfiltration
*   **Description:**
    1. The AI Dubbing application reads configuration parameters, including the output Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, from a Google Spreadsheet.
    2. The `generate_video_file` Cloud Function uses the `gcs_bucket` parameter from the spreadsheet configuration to store the generated video file.
    3. An attacker who gains unauthorized write access to the configuration spreadsheet can modify the `gcs_bucket` parameter.
    4. By changing the `gcs_bucket` value to a GCS bucket under their control, the attacker can redirect the output of the video dubbing process to their own bucket.
    5. When the application processes a configuration row with the attacker-modified `gcs_bucket`, the generated video file, which could contain sensitive content from the victim's `video_file`, will be uploaded to the attacker's bucket.
    6. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate video content processed by the AI Dubbing application.
*   **Impact:** High
    *   Data Exfiltration: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive video and audio content processed by the application. This content is intended to be stored in the victim's GCS bucket but is redirected to an attacker-controlled bucket.
    *   Confidentiality Breach:  Compromises the confidentiality of the video and audio data.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None in the application code itself.
    *   The README.md mentions that Google Cloud IAM roles are granted to the service account, suggesting that access control should be managed at the Google Cloud project level. However, there are no specific controls within the application to prevent using arbitrary output buckets.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The application should validate and sanitize the `gcs_bucket` parameter read from the spreadsheet. It should verify that the bucket name conforms to expected patterns and potentially check if the target bucket is within an allowed list or the same Google Cloud project.
    *   **Output Bucket Restriction:** The application should enforce that the output GCS bucket must be within the same Google Cloud project as the application or a pre-defined list of allowed buckets. It should not blindly use any `gcs_bucket` value provided in the configuration spreadsheet without validation.
    *   **Spreadsheet Access Control:** While not a code mitigation, it's crucial to properly configure Google Spreadsheet sharing permissions to restrict write access only to authorized users and service accounts, as highlighted in the initial threat vector description.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Google Spreadsheet used for configuration (CONFIG_SPREADSHEET_ID). This could be due to compromised Google account credentials, misconfigured sharing settings on the spreadsheet, or other access control vulnerabilities.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **File: `/code/src/cfs/generate_video_file/main.py`**
        *   Function: `_copy_file_to_gcs(gcs_bucket, source_local_filename, destination_blob_name)`
            ```python
            def _copy_file_to_gcs(gcs_bucket: str, source_local_filename: str, destination_blob_name: str):
                """Copies a file to Google Cloud Storage from a temporary local filename.

                Args:
                  gcs_bucket: string containing the bucket name.
                  source_local_filename: Name of the local file that will be copied.
                  destination_blob_name: Name of the blob to be created in GCS.
                """
                storage_client = storage.Client()
                bucket = storage_client.bucket(gcs_bucket) # [VULNERABLE LINE] - gcs_bucket is taken directly from config
                blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)
                print(gcs_bucket)
                print(source_local_filename)
                print(destination_blob_name)
                print('Checking if blob exists')
                if blob.exists():
                    print('Deleting existing target file')
                    blob.delete()
                blob.upload_from_filename(source_local_filename)
            ```
            *   **Vulnerability Point:** Line `bucket = storage_client.bucket(gcs_bucket)` directly uses the `gcs_bucket` variable, which originates from the Google Spreadsheet configuration without any validation or restriction.
            *   **Flow:**
                1.  The `main` function in `generate_video_file/main.py` is triggered by a Pub/Sub message.
                2.  The message data (configuration) includes the `gcs_bucket` value, which is read from the spreadsheet in the `generate_tts_files` Cloud Function.
                3.  `_mix_video_and_speech` function is called with the configuration.
                4.  Inside `_mix_video_and_speech`, after generating the video file, `_copy_file_to_gcs` is called to upload the video.
                5.  The `gcs_bucket` parameter passed to `_copy_file_to_gcs` is directly taken from the configuration, which can be manipulated by an attacker via the spreadsheet.
                6.  The generated video is then uploaded to the attacker-specified `gcs_bucket`.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Deploy the AI Dubbing application in a Google Cloud project.
        *   Create and configure the Google Spreadsheet with valid input data, including a `gcs_bucket` that you control for testing purposes initially.
        *   Ensure the application is functioning correctly and generating videos in your test GCS bucket.
        *   Create a separate Google Cloud project and a GCS bucket within it. This will be the attacker-controlled bucket. Note the name of this attacker bucket.
    2.  **Exploit Steps:**
        *   Assume you have gained write access to the configuration Google Spreadsheet (e.g., through compromised credentials or misconfiguration).
        *   Open the configuration spreadsheet.
        *   Locate a row that will be processed by the application (or create a new row).
        *   Modify the `gcs_bucket` column in this row to the name of the attacker-controlled GCS bucket you created in step 1. Keep other mandatory fields valid, such as `video_file`, `text`, and `voice_id`, pointing to valid resources in the victim's project (or your test project if testing end-to-end).
        *   Save the changes to the spreadsheet.
        *   Trigger the AI Dubbing process. This can be done by waiting for the scheduled execution of the Cloud Scheduler job or by manually triggering the `ai-dubbing-trigger` Cloud Scheduler job from the Google Cloud Console (as described in the README.md under "Note" in "Trigger the generation process").
    3.  **Verification Steps:**
        *   After triggering the process, wait for the Cloud Functions to execute (check Cloud Function logs for progress or errors).
        *   Go to the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the attacker-controlled GCS bucket you specified in the spreadsheet.
        *   Check if the generated video file (named based on `campaign`, `topic`, and `voice_id` from the spreadsheet row) is present in the attacker-controlled bucket.
        *   If the video file is found in the attacker's bucket, the data exfiltration vulnerability is confirmed.
        *   Optionally, check the original (victim's or test) GCS bucket specified in the Terraform variables. The video file might or might not be present there depending on the exact code execution flow, but the critical point is its presence in the attacker's bucket.
    4.  **Expected Result:** The generated video file should be found in the attacker-controlled GCS bucket, demonstrating successful data exfiltration due to the uncontrolled output bucket vulnerability. The "Status" column in the spreadsheet for the modified row should ideally indicate "Video OK," misleadingly suggesting successful operation from the victim's perspective.
