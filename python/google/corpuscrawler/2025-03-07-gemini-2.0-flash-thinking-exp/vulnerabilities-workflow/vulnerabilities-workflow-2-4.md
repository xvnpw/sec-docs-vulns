Based on the provided vulnerability report and the instructions, let's evaluate if the vulnerability should be included in the updated list.

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Manx Radio crawler

**Evaluation against inclusion criteria:**
* **Valid vulnerability that is part of attack vector:** Yes, the description clearly outlines how a malicious website can exploit the crawler to inject JavaScript into the corpus. This is a valid attack vector.

**Evaluation against exclusion criteria:**
* **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** No, the vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization, not just missing documentation.
* **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** No, this is an XSS vulnerability, not a DoS vulnerability.
* **Not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world:** No, it is realistic. An attacker can set up a malicious website and trick a user into crawling it.
* **Not completely described, e.g. missing source code analysis or security test case:** No, the description includes source code analysis and a security test case.
* **Only theoretical, e.g. missing evidence of exploit in source code analysis:** No, the security test case demonstrates the exploit.
* **Not high or critical severity:** Yes, the vulnerability is ranked as **Medium** severity. According to the instructions, vulnerabilities that are "not high or critical severity" should be excluded.

**Conclusion:**

Although the vulnerability is valid and part of the attack vector, it is ranked as "Medium" severity. According to the exclusion criteria, only high or critical severity vulnerabilities should be included. Therefore, this vulnerability should be excluded from the updated list.

Since there is only one vulnerability provided, and it is excluded based on severity, the updated list should be empty.
