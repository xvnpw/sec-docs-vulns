### 1. Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Package Replacement (General Supply Chain Vulnerability)

- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Python package with a name similar to `trimmed_match`.
    2. The attacker distributes this malicious package through channels outside the official Trimmed Match repository (e.g., a typosquatted PyPI package, or via social engineering pointing to a malicious link).
    3. A user, intending to install the legitimate `trimmed_match` library, is tricked into installing the malicious package. This could happen due to typosquatting, social engineering, or compromised third-party repositories.
    4. When the user installs the malicious package using `pip install <malicious_package_name>` and later imports the package in their Python code using `import trimmed_match`, the malicious `setup.py` or `__init__.py` (or other malicious code within the package) is executed.
    5. This execution can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running `pip install` and the Python script.

- Impact:
    - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, system compromise, and unauthorized access.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided PROJECT FILES. The provided files focus on the functionality of the Trimmed Match library itself and its build process, not on package distribution security.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Package Integrity Verification: Implement and document a mechanism for users to verify the integrity and authenticity of the Trimmed Match package before installation. This could include:
        - Publishing package checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) on the official repository (GitHub) and in documentation.
        - Signing the PyPI package with a trusted key.
        - Encouraging users to install directly from the official GitHub repository and verify the source.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker successfully creates and distributes a malicious package with a name similar to `trimmed_match`.
    2. A user is tricked into installing the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
    3. The malicious package contains code designed to execute arbitrary commands upon installation or import.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided PROJECT FILES do not contain any specific code that directly mitigates or exacerbates this vulnerability. The vulnerability is inherent to the general Python package installation process and the potential for supply chain attacks.
    - `setup.py`: While the `setup.py` script itself in the legitimate project is not inherently vulnerable, a *malicious* `setup.py` in a replacement package is the primary vector for arbitrary code execution in this scenario.
    - `trimmed_match/__init__.py`: If a malicious package replaces this file with one containing malicious code, it will be executed upon import.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Package (Simulate Attacker):**
        - Create a directory structure mimicking a Python package, e.g., `malicious_trimmed_match`.
        - Inside `malicious_trimmed_match`, create `setup.py` and `trimmed_match/__init__.py`.
        - In `setup.py`, add code that executes a harmless command (e.g., printing a message or creating a file) during installation:
          ```python
          from setuptools import setup

          setup(
              name='trimmed_match',
              version='1.0.0',
              packages=['trimmed_match'],
              entry_points={
                  'console_scripts': [
                      'malicious-command=trimmed_match:malicious_function',
                  ],
              },
          )

          import os
          os.system('echo "Malicious package installed!" > /tmp/malicious_install.txt')
          ```
        - In `trimmed_match/__init__.py`, add code that executes a harmless command upon import:
          ```python
          import os
          os.system('echo "Malicious code executed on import!" > /tmp/malicious_import.txt')
          ```
        - Create a `README.md` and `LICENSE` (can be dummy files).
    2. **Victim Installation (Simulate User):**
        - In a separate environment, navigate to the directory containing `malicious_trimmed_match`.
        - Execute `pip install .` (or `pip install ./malicious_trimmed_match` if outside the directory).
        - Check for the file `/tmp/malicious_install.txt` to confirm code execution during installation.
        - Open a Python interpreter.
        - Execute `import trimmed_match`.
        - Check for the file `/tmp/malicious_import.txt` to confirm code execution during import.
    3. **Verification:**
        - If both `/tmp/malicious_install.txt` and `/tmp/malicious_import.txt` are created, it demonstrates that arbitrary code can be executed during installation and import of a maliciously crafted package with the same name.
