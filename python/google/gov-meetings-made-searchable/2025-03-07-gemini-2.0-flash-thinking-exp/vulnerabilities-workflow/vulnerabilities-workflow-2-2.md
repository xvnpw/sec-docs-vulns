### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Results
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious search query containing JavaScript code.
  2. The victim uses the `app-engine-front-end` application and submits the malicious search query.
  3. The `app-engine-front-end` application sends the query to the `in-video-search` or `archive-video-search` service via `ep-searchVideo.py` or `ep-searchArchive.py` endpoints.
  4. The `in-video-search` or `archive-video-search` service queries Elasticsearch, which indexes the meeting transcripts without sanitization.
  5. Elasticsearch returns search results that include the malicious JavaScript code within the highlighted snippets of the transcript.
  6. `ep-searchVideo.py` or `ep-searchArchive.py` endpoint in `app-engine-front-end` receives the search results from backend service and includes the raw highlighted snippets in the JSON response without sanitization.
  7. The `app-engine-front-end` application's JavaScript code processes the JSON response and renders the search results in the user's browser, directly embedding the unsanitized highlighted snippets (containing malicious JavaScript) into the HTML.
  8. The victim's browser executes the malicious JavaScript code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.
- Impact:
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the application.
  - Potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or other malicious actions depending on the attacker's payload.
  - If the application interacts with sensitive user data or performs actions on behalf of the user, XSS can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of this data or actions.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None identified in the provided project files. The code in `ep-searchVideo.py` and `ep-searchArchive.py` directly passes the highlighted search results from the backend service to the frontend without any sanitization. There is no evidence of output encoding or sanitization in the provided code.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: While the vulnerability is primarily output-based, input sanitization on the search query in `app-engine-front-end` could offer a defense-in-depth measure against certain types of attacks.
  - Output sanitization/escaping: The most critical missing mitigation is output sanitization or escaping of the highlighted search snippets in `ep-searchVideo.py` and `ep-searchArchive.py` before sending them to the frontend, and in the frontend JavaScript before rendering the search results in the HTML. Specifically, HTML escaping should be applied to the highlighted transcript snippets to prevent the browser from interpreting them as code.
- Preconditions:
  - A publicly accessible instance of the deployed `app-engine-front-end` application.
  - Elasticsearch must contain indexed meeting transcripts that include user-controlled content (transcripts generated from audio/video).
- Source code analysis:
  1. **`app-engine-front-end/ep-searchVideo.py` and `app-engine-front-end/ep-searchArchive.py`**:
     - These Python scripts act as endpoints in the `app-engine-front-end` application to handle video and archive searches respectively.
     - Both scripts fetch search results from backend services (`in-video-search` and `archive-video-search`) using `urlfetch.fetch`.
     - They parse the JSON response from the backend services using `ujson.loads`.
     - They iterate through the hits in the search response (`searchObj["hits"]["hits"]`).
     - Critically, they extract the highlighted transcript snippet from Elasticsearch response: `snippetStr = eachEntry["highlight"]["transcriptStr"][0]`.
     - This `snippetStr` is directly used in `resultObj["result"]` without any sanitization or encoding.
     - This `resultObj` is then serialized to JSON using `ujson.dumps` and sent as the API response to the frontend.

     ```python
     # /code/app-engine-front-end/ep-searchVideo.py (and similar in ep-searchArchive.py)
     # ...
     for eachEntry in searchObj["hits"]["hits"]:
         if "highlight" in eachEntry:
             resultObj = {}
             # ...
             snippetStr = eachEntry["highlight"]["transcriptStr"][0] # Unsanitized highlight from Elasticsearch
             snippetStr = snippetStr.replace(".", "") # Basic and insufficient sanitization
             snippetStr = snippetStr.lower()
             snippetStr = snippetStr.lstrip()
             resultObj["result"] = "... " + snippetStr +"..." # Directly using unsanitized snippet
             outputObj[str(int(tsVal)).zfill(6)] =  resultObj
     # ...
     print ujson.dumps(outputObj) # Sending JSON response with unsanitized data
     ```

  2. **Assumed Front-end JavaScript (not provided, but inferred from context)**:
     - It is assumed that the `app-engine-front-end` application includes JavaScript code that handles the API response from `ep-searchVideo.py` or `ep-searchArchive.py`.
     - This JavaScript code likely retrieves the `result` field from the JSON response.
     - It is assumed that this JavaScript directly injects the `result` content into the HTML of the search results page, likely using methods like `innerHTML` without proper escaping.

     ```javascript
     // Hypothetical vulnerable JavaScript in app-engine-front-end (not provided)
     function displaySearchResults(searchResults) {
         const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('searchResults');
         for (const timestamp in searchResults) {
             const resultItem = document.createElement('div');
             const resultText = searchResults[timestamp].result; // Unsanitized result from backend
             resultItem.innerHTML = resultText; // Vulnerable injection point - XSS
             resultsContainer.appendChild(resultItem);
         }
     }
     ```

- Security test case:
  1. **Preparation:**
     - Ensure a meeting is indexed in Elasticsearch with some transcript data.
     - Access the public URL of the deployed `app-engine-front-end` application.
  2. **Craft Malicious Payload:**
     - Create a search query that includes malicious JavaScript code within a text string that is likely to be highlighted by Elasticsearch. For example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
     - URL encode the malicious query for use in a GET request. For example, for `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, the encoded query would be `%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert('XSS')%3E`.
  3. **Execute Search Query:**
     - In the `app-engine-front-end` application, use the search bar to enter the malicious query.
     - Alternatively, directly construct a GET request to the search endpoint (e.g., `/ep-searchVideo?q=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert('XSS')%3E&urlId=test&orgId=testOrg`) replacing `urlId` and `orgId` with valid values for your test instance.
  4. **Observe Results:**
     - Examine the search results page in the browser.
     - **Expected outcome (vulnerability confirmed):** An alert box with 'XSS' should pop up in the browser, or the injected JavaScript code should execute. Inspect the HTML source of the search results to confirm that the malicious payload is directly embedded in the HTML without proper escaping.
     - **If no alert:** Check if any JavaScript errors are present in the browser's developer console. If the alert does not appear, it might indicate that some form of sanitization or encoding is present, or the front-end JavaScript rendering logic prevents execution. However, based on code analysis, sanitization is likely missing.
