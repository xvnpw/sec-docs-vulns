### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities, detailing their descriptions, potential impacts, and recommended mitigations.

#### Vulnerability 1: API Key Exposure in Command History

* Description:
    When using the command-line interface (CLI) script `scripts/cli.py`, the API key is provided as a command-line argument. Command-line arguments are often saved in shell history files (e.g., `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`). If an attacker gains access to the user's account or machine, they can potentially retrieve the API key from the shell history. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the user and access their Floq quantum computing resources.

    1. User executes the `floq-client` CLI script with the API key as a command-line argument.
    2. The command, including the API key, is recorded in shell history files (e.g., `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`).
    3. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's account or machine.
    4. The attacker reads the shell history files.
    5. The attacker extracts the API key from the command history.

* Impact:
    Unauthorized access to the victim's Floq quantum computing resources. An attacker could use the compromised API key to submit and run quantum circuits, incurring costs and potentially accessing sensitive data or disrupting operations.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement reading the API key from environment variables instead of command-line arguments in the CLI script.
    - Update the CLI documentation and help messages to instruct users to set the API key as an environment variable.
    - Remove the functionality to accept API key as command line argument.

* Preconditions:
    - The user utilizes the `scripts/cli.py` script and passes the Floq API key as a command-line argument.
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's shell history files on their local machine or server.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/scripts/cli.py`
    - Line: `parser.add_argument("api_key", type=str, help="Floq service API key")`

    ```python
    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        "Floq CLI client",
        description="A helper script that controls Floq service resources.",
    )
    parser.add_argument("api_key", type=str, help="Floq service API key") # API key taken as command line argument
    args = parser.parse_args()
    api_key = args.api_key
    # ... rest of the script using api_key ...
    ```

    The `argparse` module is used to define the `api_key` argument, which is directly read from the command line. This value is then used to authenticate with the Floq service. There is no mechanism to prevent this key from being stored in shell history.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Execute the `floq-client` CLI script with a valid API key as a command-line argument:
    ```bash
    floq-client YOUR_API_KEY jobs display
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with a real or test API key.
    3. Check the shell history file for the current user. For example, in bash, use the command:
    ```bash
    history | grep floq-client
    ```
    In zsh, use:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.zsh_history | grep floq-client
    ```
    4. Verify that the command executed in step 2, including the API key, is present in the shell history.

#### Vulnerability 2: Hardcoded API Key in Sample Code

* Description:
    The provided sample scripts in the `/code/samples/` directory contain a placeholder hardcoded API key (`API_KEY = "api_key"`). Users who are new to the library or who quickly copy and paste sample code might inadvertently use these scripts without replacing the placeholder API key with their actual API key. If this code is then shared, committed to version control, or used in an insecure environment, the placeholder API key (or potentially a real key if a user mistakenly hardcodes their actual key directly into the sample) could be exposed.

    1. User uses or copies sample code from `/code/samples/` directory.
    2. The sample code contains a hardcoded placeholder API key (`API_KEY = "api_key"`).
    3. User might not replace the placeholder with their actual API key, or might mistakenly hardcode their real API key.
    4. This code is shared, committed to version control (especially public repositories), or used in an insecure environment.
    5. The hardcoded API key becomes exposed to unintended parties.

* Impact:
    Potential unintentional exposure of the placeholder API key, or real API key if a user mistakenly hardcodes it in samples, if sample code is shared or publicly accessible. While the placeholder key itself might not grant access, it represents a bad practice and could lead to real key exposure if users follow this pattern.

* Vulnerability Rank: Low

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove the hardcoded placeholder API key from all sample scripts.
    - In the sample scripts and README documentation, provide clear instructions and best practices for API key management, emphasizing the risks of hardcoding API keys.
    - Recommend using environment variables or configuration files for API key management in sample scripts and documentation.
    - Add a warning comment in each sample script file explicitly stating not to use hardcoded API keys and to replace the placeholder with a secure method of API key retrieval.

* Preconditions:
    - Users utilize or share the sample code directly without replacing the placeholder API key.
    - Users mistakenly hardcode their real API key into the sample scripts instead of using secure methods.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/samples/simulate_samples.py`, `/code/samples/jobs_queue.py`, `/code/samples/worker_manager_async.py`, `/code/samples/simulate_expectation_values.py`, `/code/samples/worker_manager.py`, `/code/samples/pennylane.py`
    - Line: `API_KEY = "api_key"` (or similar in each sample file)

    ```python
    # Example from /code/samples/simulate_samples.py
    import cirq
    import floq.client

    API_KEY = "api_key" # Hardcoded placeholder API key
    client = floq.client.CirqClient(API_KEY)

    def main() -> None:
        """Script entry point."""
        qubits = cirq.LineQubit.range(1)
        circuit = cirq.Circuit([cirq.X(qubits[0]), cirq.measure(qubits[0])])
        result = client.simulator.run(circuit)
        print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    Each of the identified sample files contains a line that hardcodes the API key as a string literal "api_key". This placeholder is intended to be replaced, but its presence in the samples creates a risk of misuse or accidental exposure if users are not careful.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Navigate to the `/code/samples/` directory and examine each Python sample file (e.g., `simulate_samples.py`, `jobs_queue.py`, etc.).
    2. For each sample file, search for the line defining the `API_KEY` variable.
    3. Verify that the `API_KEY` variable is hardcoded with a placeholder value (e.g., `"api_key"` or `"API_KEY"`).
