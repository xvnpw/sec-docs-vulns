### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file.
    2. This malicious XML file contains an external entity declaration, for example, trying to access local files on the server or internal network resources.
    3. The attacker provides this malicious XML file as input to the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command, using the `--xsd` argument with a valid XSD schema.
    4. The `civics_cdf_validator` uses the `lxml` library to parse the XML file without explicitly disabling external entity resolution.
    5. If vulnerable, the `lxml` parser attempts to resolve the external entity, potentially leading to information disclosure (e.g., reading local files), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or other XXE-related vulnerabilities.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read local files on the server where the `civics_cdf_validator` is running. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or data.
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): An attacker could potentially make the server initiate requests to internal or external resources. This can be used to scan internal networks or interact with internal services that are not meant to be publicly accessible.
    - Denial of Service (DoS): While not the primary focus, if external entity resolution targets slow or unavailable resources, it could potentially lead to a denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses `lxml.etree.parse` for XML parsing in `base.py` (within `RulesRegistry.check_rules()`) and `validator.py` (indirectly via `base.py` and `rules.py`'s `Schema` rule) without any visible mitigations against XXE attacks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The project lacks explicit mitigations against XXE vulnerabilities in its XML parsing logic.
    - Mitigation should be implemented by configuring the `lxml` XML parser to disable external entity resolution. This can be achieved by setting the `resolve_entities` parser option to `False` when calling `etree.parse`.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to provide an XML file as input to the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command. This is readily achievable as the `validate` command takes the XML file path as a command-line argument.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/validator.py`**:
        - The `main` function uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including the XML election files and XSD schema file paths.
        - The `feed_validation` function is called to perform the validation.
    2. **File: `/code/base.py`**:
        - The `RulesRegistry.check_rules()` method is responsible for parsing both the schema and election files:
          ```python
          self.schema_tree = etree.parse(self.schema_file)
          self.election_tree = etree.parse(self.election_file)
          ```
        - The `etree.parse` function from `lxml` is used for parsing.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: There are no options provided to `etree.parse` to disable external entity resolution, leaving it vulnerable to XXE.
    3. **File: `/code/rules.py`**:
        - The `Schema` rule also uses `etree.XMLSchema(etree=self.schema_tree)` which internally relies on `lxml` parsing of the schema file, also without explicit XXE mitigation.
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[validator.py: main()] --> B[validator.py: feed_validation()]
        B --> C[base.py: RulesRegistry.check_rules()]
        C --> D{etree.parse(schema_file)}
        C --> E{etree.parse(election_file)}
        D & E --> F[lxml XML Parser (Vulnerable to XXE)]
    ```
    - The diagram above illustrates the call flow where `lxml`'s `etree.parse` is invoked without XXE protection during the validation process.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a file named `xxe.xml` with the following malicious XML content. This XML payload attempts to read the `/etc/hostname` file from the server's filesystem:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname">
    ]>
    <ElectionReport>
      <Note>XXE Vulnerability Test: &xxe;</Note>
    </ElectionReport>
    ```
    2. Create a dummy XSD schema file named `dummy_schema.xsd`. This file is needed to satisfy the validator's requirements but its content doesn't matter for XXE testing as long as it's a valid XML file:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <xs:element name="ElectionReport" type="ElectionReportType"/>
      <xs:complexType name="ElectionReportType">
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element name="Note" type="xs:string"/>
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:complexType>
    </xs:schema>
    ```
    3. Run the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command in your terminal, providing the malicious `xxe.xml` file and the `dummy_schema.xsd` file as arguments:
    ```bash
    civics_cdf_validator validate xxe.xml --xsd dummy_schema.xsd
    ```
    4. Examine the output of the command. If the vulnerability exists, the content of `/etc/hostname` (or an error message indicating file access) will be included in the output, likely within the "Info messages" section if verbose output is enabled, or potentially within error messages if the system prevents file access but still attempts to process the entity. If the system is not vulnerable, the output will not contain the hostname content and there will be no errors related to file access from external entities.
