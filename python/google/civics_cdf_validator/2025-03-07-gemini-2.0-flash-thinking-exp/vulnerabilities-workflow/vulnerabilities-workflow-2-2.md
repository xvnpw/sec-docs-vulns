- Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration.
    2. The attacker submits this malicious XML file to the `civics_cdf_validator` tool for validation.
    3. The `validator.py` script, using the `RulesRegistry` class from `base.py`, parses the XML file using `lxml.etree.parse` without explicitly disabling external entity resolution.
    4. If the malicious XML file is processed, the `lxml` library attempts to resolve the external entity.
    5. This resolution can lead to the following depending on the crafted payload:
        - Information Disclosure: The attacker can read local files from the server by referencing them in the external entity declaration.
        - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The attacker can make the server perform requests to internal or external resources, potentially accessing sensitive information or interacting with internal services.
- Impact:
    - High: An attacker can potentially read sensitive local files from the server (information disclosure) or perform actions on internal networks or external systems on behalf of the server (SSRF).
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code uses `lxml.etree.parse` with default settings, which are vulnerable to XXE if not properly configured. There is no explicit mitigation in the provided code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Disable external entity resolution in `lxml`: When parsing XML with `lxml.etree.parse`, ensure `resolve_entities=False` is set in the `etree.XMLParser` to prevent XXE vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit an XML file to the `civics_cdf_validator` tool, for example by using the `validate` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/base.py`
    2. Class: `RulesRegistry`
    3. Method: `check_rules`
    4. Code snippet:
    ```python
    def check_rules(self):
        """Checks all rules."""
        try:
          self.schema_tree = etree.parse(self.schema_file)
          self.election_tree = etree.parse(self.election_file) # Vulnerable line
        except etree.LxmlError as e:
          ...
    ```
    5. Visualization:
        ```
        validator.py --> base.py:RulesRegistry.check_rules() --> lxml.etree.parse(election_file)
        ```
    6. Step-by-step explanation:
        - The `validator.py` script calls the `feed_validation` function, which creates a `RulesRegistry` object in `base.py`.
        - Inside `RulesRegistry.check_rules()`, the `lxml.etree.parse()` function is used to parse both the schema file (`self.schema_file`) and the election file (`self.election_file`).
        - The `etree.parse()` function, by default, might resolve external entities if not explicitly configured otherwise.
        - The code does not provide any `etree.XMLParser` with `resolve_entities=False` to `etree.parse()`.
        - Therefore, if a malicious XML file with an external entity declaration is provided as `election_file`, the `lxml` parser will attempt to resolve it, leading to XXE vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious XML file (e.g., `xxe.xml`) with the following content to test for local file inclusion (replace `/etc/passwd` with a file that exists on the target system):
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE data [
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    ]>
    <ElectionReport>
      <Election>
        <Name>&xxe;</Name>
      </Election>
    </ElectionReport>
    ```
    2. Create a dummy XSD file (e.g., `dummy.xsd`) for validation, content can be minimal valid XSD:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified">
      <xs:element name="ElectionReport">
        <xs:complexType>
          <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element name="Election">
              <xs:complexType>
                <xs:sequence>
                  <xs:element name="Name" type="xs:string"/>
                </xs:sequence>
              </xs:complexType>
            </xs:element>
          </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
      </xs:element>
    </xs:schema>
    ```
    3. Run the `civics_cdf_validator` tool with the validate command, pointing to the malicious XML file and the dummy XSD file:
    ```bash
    civics_cdf_validator validate xxe.xml --xsd dummy.xsd -v
    ```
    4. Analyze the output:
        - If the `/etc/passwd` file content (or similar system file) is included in the verbose output (e.g., within the `Name` element's content or error messages), it confirms the XXE vulnerability.
        - Check for error messages related to file access or unusual behaviour that indicates external entity processing.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read local files. A similar approach can be used to test for SSRF by changing the external entity to point to an external URL or an internal service.
