- Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
- Description:
    - An attacker can craft a malicious XML file.
    - This malicious XML file contains an external entity definition that points to a local file on the system running the `civics_cdf_validator`.
    - When the `civics_cdf_validator` parses this malicious XML file using `lxml.etree.parse` (in `base.py` within `RulesRegistry.check_rules`), it attempts to resolve and process the external entity.
    - If external entity processing is not disabled, `lxml` will attempt to read the local file specified in the external entity definition.
    - The content of the targeted local file can be potentially disclosed back to the attacker or cause other unintended consequences depending on how the validator processes the parsed XML.
- Impact:
    - **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the user running the `civics_cdf_validator` has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, application code, or data files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses `lxml.etree.parse` without any explicit configuration to disable external entity resolution.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Disable External Entity Resolution:** The `lxml.etree.parse` function should be configured to disable external entity resolution. This can be achieved by using `etree.XMLParser` with `resolve_entities=False` and passing it to the `etree.parse` function.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file to the `civics_cdf_validator` for validation. This is possible as the tool is designed to validate user-provided XML files against XSD schemas via the command line.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/base.py`
    - **Class:** `RulesRegistry`
    - **Method:** `check_rules`
    ```python
    def check_rules(self):
        """Checks all rules."""
        try:
          self.schema_tree = etree.parse(self.schema_file) # Vulnerable code: etree.parse without disabling resolve_entities
          self.election_tree = etree.parse(self.election_file) # Vulnerable code: etree.parse without disabling resolve_entities
        except etree.LxmlError as e:
          exp = loggers.ElectionFatal.from_message(
              "Fatal Error. XML file could not be parsed. {}".format(e))
          self.exceptions_wrapper.exception_handler(exp)
          return
        # ... rest of the code
    ```
    - **Explanation:**
        - The `check_rules` method in `RulesRegistry` is responsible for parsing both the XSD schema file (`self.schema_file`) and the election XML file (`self.election_file`) using `lxml.etree.parse`.
        - The `lxml.etree.parse` function, by default, has external entity resolution enabled.
        - There is no `etree.XMLParser` object created and configured with `resolve_entities=False` and passed to `etree.parse`.
        - Therefore, if a malicious XML file with an external entity is provided, `lxml` will attempt to resolve it, leading to a potential XXE vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Step 1:** Create a malicious XML file (e.g., `malicious.xml`) with the following content. This XML payload attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Linux-based system:
      ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE root [
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
      ]>
      <ElectionReport>
        <Election>
          <ReportDetails>
            <Text>&xxe;</Text>
          </ReportDetails>
        </ElectionReport>
      </ElectionReport>
      ```
    - **Step 2:** Save a valid XSD schema file as `civics_cdf_spec.xsd` in the same directory as the malicious XML file. A basic valid XSD can be used for this test as the vulnerability lies in the XML parsing stage, before schema validation. For example:
      ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
        <xs:element name="ElectionReport">
          <xs:complexType>
            <xs:sequence>
              <xs:element name="Election">
                <xs:complexType>
                  <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:element name="ReportDetails">
                      <xs:complexType>
                        <xs:sequence>
                          <xs:element name="Text" type="xs:string"/>
                        </xs:sequence>
                      </xs:complexType>
                    </xs:element>
                  </xs:sequence>
                </xs:complexType>
              </xs:element>
            </xs:sequence>
          </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
      </xs:schema>
      ```
    - **Step 3:** Run the `civics_cdf_validator` tool, providing the malicious XML file and the valid XSD schema as arguments:
      ```bash
      civics_cdf_validator validate malicious.xml --xsd civics_cdf_spec.xsd -v
      ```
    - **Step 4:** Examine the output of the `civics_cdf_validator`. If the XXE vulnerability exists, the verbose output (`-v` flag) will likely contain the content of the `/etc/passwd` file embedded within the output, possibly as part of an error message or verbose log, demonstrating successful local file disclosure. If successful, the output will be different from a normal validation run and will contain user information from `/etc/passwd`. Note that the exact output might depend on the system and how `lxml` handles the inclusion of external entity content in error messages or logs. For a successful exploit, you should observe content from `/etc/passwd` in the output. On systems where `/etc/passwd` is not readable, you might need to target a different readable file for testing.
