Based on the instructions, I need to filter the provided vulnerability list.

The key instruction for exclusion is:
- are deny of service vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability 1 is explicitly described as a "Zip Bomb Vulnerability" and the impact is described as "denial of service by exhausting system resources".

Therefore, Vulnerability 1 is a deny of service vulnerability and must be excluded according to the instructions.

Since this is the only vulnerability provided and it's excluded, the output should be an empty list.
