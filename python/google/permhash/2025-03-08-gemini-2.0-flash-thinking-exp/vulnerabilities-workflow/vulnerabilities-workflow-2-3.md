- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal
- Description:
    1. An attacker can supply a malicious file path as the `--path` argument to the `permhash` command-line tool or as the `path` parameter to the library functions (e.g., `permhash_crx_manifest`, `permhash_apk`).
    2. This malicious path can contain directory traversal sequences such as `../` or `..\\`.
    3. When the `permhash` tool processes this path, it uses functions like `os.path.exists`, `os.stat`, `magic.from_file`, `open`, and `ZipFile` without proper sanitization.
    4. Due to the lack of path sanitization, the tool can be tricked into accessing files and directories outside the intended working directory.
    5. For example, providing a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` could potentially allow an attacker to access and attempt to process the `/etc/passwd` file, even though it's outside the project's scope.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the system where the `permhash` tool is executed.
    - This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if the tool is run on a system containing confidential data accessible via path traversal.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There is no input validation or sanitization implemented for the `path` argument or parameter in the provided code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for the `path` argument and parameter.
    - Canonicalize the path using `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.normpath` to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant separators and traversal components.
    - Restrict file access to a predefined safe directory if applicable, and validate that the canonicalized path is within this safe directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `permhash` tool, either via the command-line interface or by using the library in a Python script.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the `--path` argument or the `path` parameter used by the tool. For command-line, this is direct. For library, this depends on how the library is used by an application.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`permhash/scripts/cli.py`**:
        - The `main` function uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `--path`.
        - The `--path` argument is directly passed to the `permhash_*` functions in `permhash/functions.py` without any validation or sanitization.
        - If `is_dir(args.path)` returns files, the code iterates through them, concatenating `args.path` with `file` and passing this concatenated path to the `permhash_*` functions. This concatenation is vulnerable if `args.path` contains traversal sequences.
    2. **`permhash/functions.py`**:
        - The `permhash_*` functions (e.g., `permhash_crx_manifest`, `permhash_apk`) receive the `path` argument.
        - They call corresponding `create_*_permlist` functions in `permhash/helpers.py`, passing the unsanitized `path`.
    3. **`permhash/helpers.py`**:
        - Functions like `is_file`, `check_type`, `create_crx_permlist`, `create_crx_manifest_permlist`, `create_apk_manifest_permlist`, `create_apk_permlist`, `create_ipa_permlist`, and `create_macho_permlist` all directly use the provided `path` argument in file system operations without any sanitization.
        - For example, `is_file` uses `os.path.exists(path)`, `check_type` uses `magic.from_file(path, mime=True)`, and the `create_*_permlist` functions use `open(path, ...)` and `ZipFile(path, ...)`.
        - The `is_dir` function uses `os.path.abspath(path)` which resolves path, but then it appends `/` + `file` to the path from `os.listdir(path)`, which does not prevent traversal if the initial `path` argument had traversal sequences.

    ```
    Visualization of vulnerable path flow:

    User Input (malicious path) --> cli.py (--path argument) --> functions.py (permhash_* functions - path parameter) --> helpers.py (various functions like is_file, check_type, create_*_permlist - path parameter) --> os.path.exists, magic.from_file, open, ZipFile (file system operations with malicious path)
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a test file named `sensitive_test.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory with content "This is a sensitive test file.".
    2. Run the `permhash` command-line tool with the following command from any directory:
    ```bash
    permhash --type crx_manifest --path "../../../../../tmp/sensitive_test.txt"
    ```
    (The number of `../` depends on the current working directory depth. Adjust to reach the root directory and then `/tmp`.)
    3. Observe the output. If the tool attempts to process the `sensitive_test.txt` file and outputs `False` (or an error related to manifest parsing but not file access denial), it indicates the path traversal vulnerability is present.
    4. To further confirm, modify the `permhash_crx_manifest` function in `permhash/functions.py` temporarily to print the file path it receives before calling `calc_permhash`:
    ```python
    def permhash_crx_manifest(path):
        if check_type(path, CRX_MANIFEST_MIMETYPES):
            print(f"Processing path: {path}") # Added print statement
            return calc_permhash(create_crx_manifest_permlist(path), path)
        # ... rest of the function
    ```
    5. Rerun the command from step 2. The output in the console will now include `Processing path: ../../../../../tmp/sensitive_test.txt` which, after the path traversal resolution by the underlying OS during file operations, will effectively access `/tmp/sensitive_test.txt`, demonstrating the vulnerability.
