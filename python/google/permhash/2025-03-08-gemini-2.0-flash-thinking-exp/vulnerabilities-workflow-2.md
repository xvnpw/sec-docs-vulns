## Combined Vulnerability Report

After reviewing the provided vulnerability lists and removing duplicates and excluding vulnerabilities based on the specified criteria, the following vulnerability is identified:

### Path Traversal in Command-Line Tool

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious file path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `/..`) or absolute paths.
    2. The attacker executes the `permhash` command-line tool, providing the malicious file path as the argument to the `--path` parameter.
    3. The `permhash` script in `cli.py` receives the unsanitized file path.
    4. The script calls the relevant permhash function (e.g., `permhash_crx_manifest`, `permhash_apk`) from `functions.py`, passing the unsanitized file path.
    5. The permhash function, in turn, calls helper functions in `helpers.py` (e.g., `check_type`, `create_crx_manifest_permlist`) with the same unsanitized path.
    6. Helper functions like `is_file`, `check_type` and functions that open files (`open`, `ZipFile`) in `helpers.py` use the attacker-controlled path directly without sanitization.
    7. Due to the lack of path sanitization, the tool accesses files outside the intended scope, as specified by the attacker's malicious path. For example, an attacker could access system files like `/etc/passwd` or any other file accessible by the user running the tool.

- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system that the user running the `permhash` tool has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, application data, or system files.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any input sanitization or validation on the `--path` argument in `cli.py` or in the helper functions in `helpers.py`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization of the `--path` argument in `cli.py` to prevent path traversal. This could include:
        - Validating that the path is relative and does not contain `../` sequences.
        - Validating that the path is within a designated safe directory.
        - Using secure path handling functions to resolve and normalize paths safely.
    - Path Canonicalization: Canonicalize the path using `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.normpath` to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant separators and traversal components.
    - Restrict File Access: Restrict file access to a predefined safe directory if applicable, and validate that the canonicalized path is within this safe directory.
    - Principle of Least Privilege:  While not a code mitigation, documenting and recommending running the tool with minimal necessary privileges can reduce the potential impact of this vulnerability.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `permhash` command-line tool.
    - The attacker must know the file paths they want to access on the system or be able to guess them.
    - The user running the `permhash` tool must have read permissions to the files the attacker wants to access.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`permhash/scripts/cli.py:main()`**:
        ```python
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument(
            "-p",
            "--path",
            required=True,
            type=str,
            action="store",
            help="Full path to file to calculate permhash from.",
        )
        # ...
        args = parser.parse_args()
        # ...
        if args.type == "crx_manifest":
            print(permhash_crx_manifest(args.path)) # args.path is directly passed
        elif args.type == "apk":
            print(permhash_apk(args.path)) # args.path is directly passed
        # ... and so on for other types
        ```
        The `args.path` from the command line is directly passed to the permhash functions without any validation or sanitization.

    2. **`permhash/functions.py:permhash_crx_manifest(path)` (and similar functions)**:
        ```python
        def permhash_crx_manifest(path):
            if check_type(path, CRX_MANIFEST_MIMETYPES): # path is directly passed
                return calc_permhash(create_crx_manifest_permlist(path), path) # path is directly passed
            # ...
        ```
        The `path` argument is passed directly to `check_type` and `create_crx_manifest_permlist` without sanitization.

    3. **`permhash/helpers.py:check_type(path, mime)`**:
        ```python
        def check_type(path, mime):
            if is_file(path): # path is directly passed
                try:
                    result = bool(magic.from_file(path, mime=True) in mime) # path is directly passed to magic.from_file
                    return result
                except IsADirectoryError:
                    # ...
            return False
        ```
        The `path` argument is passed to `is_file` and `magic.from_file` without sanitization. `magic.from_file` will open and read the file from the provided path.

    4. **`permhash/helpers.py:is_file(path)`**:
        ```python
        def is_file(path):
            if os.path.exists(path): # path is directly passed to os.path.exists
                return bool(os.stat(path).st_size != 0) # path is directly passed to os.stat
            # ...
        ```
        The `path` argument is used with `os.path.exists` and `os.stat`, which perform file system operations based on the provided path.

    5. **`permhash/helpers.py:create_crx_manifest_permlist(path)` (and similar `create_*_permlist` functions)**:
        ```python
        def create_crx_manifest_permlist(path):
            if check_type(path, CRX_MANIFEST_MIMETYPES): # path is directly passed
                with open(path, "rb") as manifest_byte_stream: # path is directly passed to open
                    # ...
        ```
        The `path` argument is directly used in `open(path, "rb")` to open and read the file content. This is where the path traversal vulnerability is directly exploitable, as it allows opening and reading arbitrary files based on the user-provided path.

    ```
    Visualization of vulnerable path flow:

    User Input (malicious path) --> cli.py (--path argument) --> functions.py (permhash_* functions - path parameter) --> helpers.py (various functions like is_file, check_type, create_*_permlist - path parameter) --> os.path.exists, magic.from_file, open, ZipFile (file system operations with malicious path)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install `permhash` using `pip install .` from the `/code` directory.
        - Create a sensitive file named `sensitive_data.txt` in your home directory with some content like "This is sensitive information.".
        - Navigate to a temporary directory in the terminal.

    2. **Execution:**
        - Execute the `permhash` command-line tool to attempt to access the sensitive file using a path traversal payload:
          ```bash
          permhash --type crx_manifest --path "/home/$USER/sensitive_data.txt"
          ```
          Replace `$USER` with your username. Or, if you are in a subdirectory of your home directory:
          ```bash
          permhash --type crx_manifest --path "../sensitive_data.txt"
          ```
        - To further verify, try to access a standard system file like `/etc/passwd`:
          ```bash
          permhash --type crx_manifest --path "/etc/passwd"
          ```

    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine the output of the command. If the command outputs a permhash value (a long hexadecimal string) instead of `False` or an error indicating an invalid file type or path, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. This is because `permhash` successfully processed the content of `sensitive_data.txt` or `/etc/passwd` as if it were a CRX manifest file and calculated a hash.

        - **Expected Vulnerable Output:** The command will likely output a SHA256 hash.

        - **Expected Correct/Secure Behavior (Mitigation Implemented):** The command should either:
            - Output `False` indicating that the file is not a valid CRX manifest file.
            - Output an error message stating that the provided path is invalid or outside the allowed scope.
            - Ideally, perform path sanitization and reject paths attempting to traverse directories.
