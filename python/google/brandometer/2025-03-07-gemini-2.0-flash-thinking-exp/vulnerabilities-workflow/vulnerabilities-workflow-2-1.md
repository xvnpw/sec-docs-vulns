### Vulnerability 1: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Survey Creation

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can create a new survey or edit an existing survey through the Brandometer application's survey creation/edit interface.
    2. In the survey creation/edit form, the attacker inputs malicious JavaScript code into fields such as "question1", "answer1a", "surveyname", or any other text-based input field. For example, an attacker might input `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` into the "question1" field.
    3. The Brandometer application saves this malicious payload into the Firestore database without proper sanitization or validation.
    4. When a user (either an administrator previewing the survey or an end-user taking the survey if creatives are directly served) accesses the survey preview page or interacts with the downloaded survey creatives, the stored XSS payload is retrieved from Firestore and embedded into the HTML page.
    5. Because the application does not properly encode or sanitize the output, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser. This results in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    - **Account Takeover:** If an administrator accesses a survey containing the XSS payload, an attacker could potentially steal their session cookies or credentials, leading to account takeover and unauthorized access to the Brandometer application and potentially the underlying Google Cloud project.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive data, including survey responses or other data accessible to users interacting with the survey creatives.
    - **Defacement:** Attackers can deface the survey creatives, altering the intended content and potentially damaging the brand reputation of the survey creator.
    - **Malware Distribution:** In more advanced scenarios, attackers could use XSS to redirect users to malicious websites or distribute malware.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Basic authentication is implemented for accessing the Brandometer application, which might prevent unauthorized users from directly creating or editing surveys if the attacker is external. However, once an attacker gains access (e.g., through compromised credentials or if basic auth is weak/default), this mitigation is ineffective against XSS.
    - Jinja2 templating engine is used, which by default provides auto-escaping. However, this might not be sufficient if the data is used in JavaScript contexts within the templates or if `|safe` filter is used incorrectly, and it doesn't prevent Stored XSS if the input is not sanitized before storing in the database.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement server-side input sanitization for all user-provided text fields in the survey creation and edit forms. Sanitize HTML tags and JavaScript code before storing data in Firestore. Libraries like Bleach in Python can be used for HTML sanitization.
    - **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding in Jinja2 templates, especially when rendering user-provided content in different contexts (HTML, JavaScript). Use appropriate Jinja2 filters like `escapejs` when embedding data within `<script>` tags or JavaScript event handlers.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting the loading of scripts from untrusted domains.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to have access to the Brandometer survey creation interface. This could be achieved by:
        - Having valid credentials for the Brandometer application (username and password for basic authentication).
        - Exploiting any authentication bypass or weakness.
        - If the application is publicly accessible without authentication for survey creation (which is unlikely based on description but needs verification).

- **Source Code Analysis:**

    1. **Form Definition (`/code/creative/app/forms.py`):**
        - The `QuestionForm` class defines various fields for survey creation, including `StringField` for questions and answers.
        - Input validation is limited to `DataRequired` validators, ensuring that fields are not empty.
        - There is **no input sanitization or encoding** applied at the form definition level.

    2. **Route Handling (`/code/creative/app/main.py`):**
        - The `/survey/create` and `/survey/edit` routes in `main.py` handle the submission of the `QuestionForm`.
        - In the `create` and `edit` functions, after form validation, the `form.data` is directly passed to `survey_service.create(form)` and `survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form)`.
        - **No sanitization or encoding** is performed in the route handlers before passing data to the service layer.

    3. **Survey Service (`/code/creative/app/survey_service.py`):**
        - The `create` and `update_by_id` functions in `survey_service.py` receive the form data and pass it directly to `survey_collection.create` and `survey_collection.update_by_id`.
        - **No sanitization or encoding** is performed in the service layer.

    4. **Survey Collection (`/code/creative/app/survey_collection.py`):**
        - The `create` and `update_by_id` functions in `survey_collection.py` use the Firestore client to store the provided data directly into the database.
        - Firestore stores the data as is, without any inherent sanitization.

    5. **Creative Template (`/code/creative/app/templates/creative.html` - not provided but assumed to be rendering survey data):**
        - Assuming `creative.html` renders survey questions and answers using Jinja2 templates like `{{ survey.question1 }}`, Jinja2's auto-escaping is in place for basic HTML context.
        - However, if the template uses `|safe` filter to bypass auto-escaping (which is not evident from provided code but is a common mistake) or if the data is placed in JavaScript context without proper escaping (e.g., within `<script>` tags or event handlers), then XSS is possible.

    **Code Flow Visualization:**

    ```
    [Browser - Survey Creation Form] --> [Flask Route (/survey/create or /survey/edit) in main.py]
        --> [form.validate_on_submit() - forms.py]
        --> [survey_service.create(form) or survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form) - survey_service.py]
            --> [survey_collection.create(form.data) or survey_collection.update_by_id(survey_id, form.data) - survey_collection.py]
                --> [Firestore Database] (Data Stored without Sanitization)

    [User Accessing Survey Preview or Creative] --> [Flask Route (/survey/preview or serving creative) in main.py]
        --> [survey_service.get_doc_by_id(survey_id) - survey_service.py]
            --> [survey_collection.get_doc_by_id(survey_id) - survey_collection.py]
                --> [Firestore Database] (Data Retrieved - Potentially Malicious Payload)
        --> [render_template('creative.html', survey=survey_info, ...) - main.py]
            --> [creative.html - Jinja2 Template] (Malicious Payload Rendered and Executed in Browser if not properly escaped)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Login to Brandometer:** Access the Brandometer application using valid credentials (if basic auth is enabled).
    2. **Navigate to Survey Creation:** Click on "Create survey" in the Brandometer UI.
    3. **Inject XSS Payload:** Fill in the survey creation form with the following details:
        - Survey Name: `XSS Test Survey`
        - Question 1: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">`
        - Answer 1a: `Option A`
        - Answer 1b: `Option B`
        - (Fill in other required fields with arbitrary valid values)
    4. **Submit Survey:** Click the "Submit" button to create the survey.
    5. **Navigate to Survey Index:** Go back to the survey list or home page.
    6. **Preview Survey:** Find the newly created "XSS Test Survey" and click the "Preview" button.
    7. **Observe for XSS:** Check if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" appears in your browser when the survey preview page loads.

    **Expected Result:** If the alert box appears, the Stored XSS vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the injected JavaScript code from the "Question 1" field was executed in the browser, demonstrating the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.
