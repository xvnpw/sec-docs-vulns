### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Survey Questions

- Description:
    An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into survey questions and answers during survey creation or editing. This is possible because user-provided survey content is rendered in the survey creatives (HTML) without proper sanitization or output encoding. When a user previews the survey, downloads the survey creative, or when a survey participant interacts with the survey, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Access the survey creation page by navigating to `/survey/create`.
    2. In the "Question 1" text field, input the following XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3. Fill in the required "Answer" fields for Question 1 (e.g., "Answer A", "Answer B").
    4. Click the "Submit" button to create the survey.
    5. After successful survey creation, navigate to the survey preview page at `/survey/preview/<survey_id>` (replace `<survey_id>` with the actual survey ID, obtainable from the URL after creation).
    6. Observe that an alert box with "XSS" is displayed, indicating successful execution of the injected JavaScript code.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to various malicious activities:
    - **Account Hijacking:** Attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive information, potentially leading to account takeover of administrators or users analyzing survey data.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be designed to extract survey data, user responses, or other sensitive information displayed in the context of the Brandometer application.
    - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users interacting with the survey could be redirected to attacker-controlled websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware infections.
    - **Defacement:** The survey interface or even the entire Brandometer application could be defaced, impacting brand reputation and user trust.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Basic authentication is implemented using `flask_basicauth`, requiring users to authenticate to access the application. However, this does not prevent XSS attacks once an authenticated user creates a survey with malicious content. Basic authentication protects access to the application, but not against vulnerabilities within the application logic itself.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Encoding/Escaping:** The most critical missing mitigation is proper output encoding or escaping of user-provided survey questions and answers when rendering them in HTML templates, specifically in `creative.html`. Jinja2 templating engine, used by Flask, offers features for auto-escaping or manual escaping using the `| e` filter. This should be applied to all variables that render user-supplied content in HTML templates to prevent browsers from interpreting them as HTML or JavaScript code.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to the Brandometer application to create or edit surveys. If basic authentication is enabled and credentials are not compromised, this might require legitimate user credentials. However, if the instance is publicly accessible without strong authentication, the precondition is minimal.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/creative/app/main.py`**:
        - The `/survey/create` and `/survey/edit` routes in `main.py` render the `questions.html` template for survey creation and editing.
        - The `/survey/preview/<string:survey_id>` route renders the `creative.html` template for survey preview. This route fetches survey data using `survey_service.get_doc_by_id(survey_id)` and passes it to the `creative.html` template.

    2. **File: `/code/creative/app/survey_service.py`**:
        - `get_html_template` function is responsible for rendering `creative.html`.
        - It passes the `survey_dict` as the `survey` variable to the `creative.html` template:
        ```python
        def get_html_template(survey_id, survey_dict, seg_type):
          return render_template(
              'creative.html',
              survey=survey_dict, # Survey data passed to template
              survey_id=survey_id,
              show_back_button=False,
              all_question_json=get_question_json(survey_dict),
              seg=seg_type,
              thankyou_text=get_thank_you_text(survey_dict),
              next_text=get_next_text(survey_dict),
              comment_text=get_comment_text(survey_dict))
        ```

    3. **File: `/code/creative/app/forms.py`**:
        - `QuestionForm` defines fields for survey questions (e.g., `question1 = StringField('question1', validators=[DataRequired()])`) and answers using `StringField`.
        - **Crucially, there is no sanitization or encoding performed on the input data within the form validation or data handling.** The `StringField` simply captures text input without any security processing.

    4. **File: `/code/creative/app/templates/creative.html` (not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming its structure based on context):**
        - **Assuming `creative.html` directly renders survey questions and answers using Jinja2 syntax like `{{ survey.question1 }}` without any escaping filters.** For example:
        ```html
        <div>{{ survey.question1 }}</div>
        <div>{{ survey.answer1a }}</div>
        ```
        - In this scenario, if `survey.question1` or `survey.answer1a` contains malicious HTML or JavaScript, it will be directly rendered by the browser, leading to XSS.

    **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [Attacker Input (Malicious Script in Question)] --> [Survey Creation Form (/survey/create)] --> [Forms.py (StringField, No Sanitization)] --> [Firestore (Data Stored)] --> [Survey Preview/Creative Generation (/survey/preview, survey_service.get_html_template)] --> [creative.html (Unescaped Rendering of Survey Data)] --> [User Browser (XSS Execution)]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Access to a running instance of the Brandometer application.
        - User credentials to log in if basic authentication is enabled (or if the instance is publicly accessible).

    2. **Steps:**
        a. Open a web browser and navigate to the Brandometer application's survey creation page (e.g., `http://<your-brandometer-instance>/survey/create`).
        b. Log in with valid credentials if required.
        c. In the "Survey Name" field, enter a name for the survey (e.g., "XSS Test Survey").
        d. In the "Question 1" field, enter the following payload: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability');</script>`.
        e. In the "Answer 1a" field, enter "Answer A".
        f. In the "Answer 1b" field, enter "Answer B".
        g. Ensure "Answer 1a Next" and "Answer 1b Next" are set to "end".
        h. Click the "Submit" button to create the survey.
        i. After successful creation, navigate to the survey listing page (e.g., `http://<your-brandometer-instance>/index`).
        j. Locate the newly created "XSS Test Survey" and click on the "Preview" button (or a similar button to preview the survey).
        k. **Expected Outcome:** An alert box should pop up in the browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability". This confirms that the JavaScript code injected into the question was executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to the lack of output encoding of user-provided survey content in the HTML templates.
