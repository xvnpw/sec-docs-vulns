## Vulnerability Report

The following vulnerability was identified in the Brandometer application related to survey creation functionality.

### Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Survey Creation

- **Description:**
    An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into various text-based input fields during the creation or editing of surveys through the Brandometer application's survey management interface. These fields include, but are not limited to, survey name, question text, and answer options. The injected script is then stored in the Firestore database without proper sanitization. When a user, such as an administrator previewing the survey or an end-user taking the survey if creatives are directly served, accesses the survey or related creatives, the application retrieves the unsanitized data from Firestore and embeds it into the HTML content of the page.  Due to the lack of output encoding, the browser executes the malicious JavaScript code, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the survey creation interface (potentially after authenticating or if the interface is publicly accessible) navigates to the survey creation or edit page.
    2.  In the survey creation/edit form, the attacker inputs malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into a text field such as "Survey Name", "Question 1", or "Answer 1a".
    3.  The Brandometer application saves this malicious payload directly into the Firestore database without any sanitization or validation of the input.
    4.  When a user (administrator or end-user) accesses the survey preview page, survey creatives, or potentially survey reports, the application fetches the survey data from Firestore.
    5.  The application renders the survey data using templates (e.g., `creative.html`), embedding the unsanitized data directly into the HTML.
    6.  The user's browser receives the HTML content containing the malicious script and executes it, resulting in the XSS vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this Stored XSS vulnerability can have severe consequences:
    - **Account Takeover:** An attacker can steal session cookies or credentials of administrators or other users who access surveys containing the malicious payload. This can lead to unauthorized access to the Brandometer application and potentially the underlying Google Cloud project, allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be designed to steal sensitive data accessible to users interacting with the survey, including survey responses, user information, or other data displayed within the application's context. This stolen data can be transmitted to attacker-controlled servers.
    - **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of survey pages or creatives, defacing the application and potentially damaging the brand reputation of survey creators. This could involve altering survey questions, answers, or redirecting users to unintended content.
    - **Malware Distribution and Further Attacks:** XSS can be used as a stepping stone for more complex attacks. Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, distribute malware, or conduct phishing attacks by impersonating legitimate application functionalities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Basic Authentication:** The Brandometer application implements basic authentication using `flask-basicauth` to protect access to the survey creation and management interface. This is configured in `main.py`. However, basic authentication only controls access to the admin interface and does not prevent XSS vulnerabilities if an authenticated user injects malicious content. Once an attacker gains access (through valid credentials or bypassing authentication), this mitigation is ineffective against Stored XSS.
    - **Jinja2 Templating Engine:** The application uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, which provides auto-escaping by default. While Jinja2's auto-escaping can mitigate some XSS risks, it is context-dependent and might not be sufficient, especially if data is used in JavaScript contexts within templates or if the `|safe` filter is used incorrectly to bypass escaping. Furthermore, auto-escaping does not prevent Stored XSS if the malicious input is stored in the database without prior sanitization.
    - **Input Validation (Limited):** The `QuestionForm` in `forms.py` includes `DataRequired` validators to ensure that certain form fields are not empty. However, this is a basic validation and does not include any input sanitization or encoding to prevent XSS.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement server-side input sanitization for all user-provided text fields in the survey creation and edit forms before storing data in Firestore. Sanitize HTML tags and JavaScript code to remove or neutralize potentially malicious content. Libraries like Bleach in Python are recommended for HTML sanitization.
    - **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding in Jinja2 templates, especially when rendering user-provided content retrieved from the database. Apply context-appropriate escaping filters based on where the data is being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, URLs, etc.). Use Jinja2 filters like `escape` (or `e`) for HTML context and `escapejs` (or `js_escape`) when embedding data within `<script>` tags or JavaScript event handlers.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting the loading of scripts and other resources from untrusted domains. A properly configured CSP can act as a strong defense-in-depth mechanism.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS, in the application. This includes both automated and manual testing to ensure comprehensive security coverage.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Access to Survey Creation Interface:** An attacker needs to access the Brandometer survey creation or edit interface. This typically requires authentication via basic authentication.  If the attacker possesses valid credentials, or if there is an authentication bypass vulnerability, they can access this interface. In scenarios where the application is misconfigured and the survey creation interface is publicly accessible without authentication, the preconditions for exploitation are minimal.

- **Source Code Analysis:**

    1. **Form Definition (`/code/creative/app/forms.py`):**
        - The `QuestionForm` class in `forms.py` defines the structure for survey creation forms, utilizing `StringField` for text inputs like questions, answers, and survey names.
        - Input validation is limited to `DataRequired` validators, which only ensure that fields are not left empty.
        - **Crucially, there is no input sanitization or output encoding implemented at the form definition level.** The form fields accept and process raw text input without any security measures.

    2. **Route Handling (`/code/creative/app/main.py`):**
        - The `/survey/create` and `/survey/edit` routes in `main.py` handle survey creation and editing requests.
        - Within the `create()` and `edit()` functions, after form validation using `form.validate_on_submit()`, the `form.data` is directly passed to the service layer functions `survey_service.create(form)` and `survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form)`.
        - **No sanitization or encoding is performed within the route handlers before passing the user-provided data to the service layer.** This means that potentially malicious input is forwarded without any security processing.

    3. **Survey Service (`/code/creative/app/survey_service.py`):**
        - The `create()` and `update_by_id()` functions in `survey_service.py` receive the form data and directly pass it to the data access layer functions `survey_collection.create()` and `survey_collection.update_by_id()`.
        - The `get_html_template()` function is responsible for rendering the `creative.html` template. It retrieves survey data as `survey_dict` and passes it directly to `render_template('creative.html', survey=survey_dict, ...)`.
        - **No sanitization or encoding is implemented in the service layer before storing data in Firestore or before rendering data in templates.** The service layer acts as a pass-through for user input without applying any security measures.

    4. **Survey Collection (`/code/creative/app/survey_collection.py`):**
        - The `create()` and `update_by_id()` functions in `survey_collection.py` use the Firestore client to store the provided data directly into the database.
        - Firestore stores the data as is, without any inherent sanitization or encoding.
        - **The data access layer simply persists the user-provided data into Firestore without any security processing.**

    5. **Creative Template (`/code/creative/app/templates/creative.html`):**
        - The `creative.html` template (and potentially other templates rendering survey data like `index.html`, `questions.html`, and reporting templates) is assumed to render survey questions and answers using Jinja2 templating syntax, such as `{{ survey.question1 }}`.
        - **If the template directly renders these variables without applying any escaping filters, it will be vulnerable to XSS.** While Jinja2 has auto-escaping enabled by default, it is possible that:
            - Auto-escaping is not effective in certain contexts (e.g., within JavaScript code blocks in the template).
            - Developers have used the `|safe` filter to bypass auto-escaping, intending to render HTML but inadvertently creating an XSS vulnerability.
            - Auto-escaping is disabled globally or for specific sections of the template.

    **Code Flow Visualization:**

    ```
    [Browser - Survey Creation Form] --> [Flask Route (/survey/create or /survey/edit) in main.py]
        --> [form.validate_on_submit() - forms.py (Data Validation Only)]
        --> [survey_service.create(form) or survey_service.update_by_id(docref_id, form) - survey_service.py (No Sanitization)]
            --> [survey_collection.create(form.data) or survey_collection.update_by_id(survey_id, form.data) - survey_collection.py (Firestore Storage)]
                --> [Firestore Database - Unsanitized Data Stored]

    [User Accessing Survey Preview or Creative] --> [Flask Route (/survey/preview or serving creative) in main.py]
        --> [survey_service.get_doc_by_id(survey_id) - survey_service.py]
            --> [survey_collection.get_doc_by_id(survey_id) - survey_collection.py (Firestore Retrieval)]
                --> [Firestore Database - Potentially Malicious Payload Retrieved]
        --> [render_template('creative.html', survey=survey_info, ...) - main.py]
            --> [creative.html - Jinja2 Template (Unescaped Rendering)]
                --> [User Browser - Malicious Payload Executed (XSS)]
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to a running instance of the Brandometer application and valid credentials for basic authentication to create or edit surveys.
    2. **Login:** Access the Brandometer application's survey management interface in a web browser and log in using valid basic authentication credentials.
    3. **Navigate to Survey Creation:** Click on "Create survey" or "Edit survey" in the Brandometer UI.
    4. **Inject XSS Payload:** Fill in the survey creation/edit form with the following details, specifically injecting the XSS payload:
        - **Survey Name:** `XSS Test Survey <script>alert('XSS in Survey Name')</script>`
        - **Question 1:** `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS in Question 1')">`
        - **Answer 1a:** `Option A <script>alert('XSS in Answer 1a')</script>`
        - **Answer 1b:** `Option B`
        - (Fill in other required fields with arbitrary valid values, ensuring the form can be submitted successfully).
    5. **Submit Survey:** Click the "Submit" button to create or update the survey.
    6. **Navigate to Survey Index:** Go back to the survey list or home page (e.g., `/index`).
    7. **Preview Survey:** Locate the newly created/edited "XSS Test Survey" and click the "Preview" button.
    8. **Observe for XSS:** Check if alert boxes appear in your browser with the messages "XSS in Survey Name", "XSS in Question 1", and "XSS in Answer 1a" when the survey preview page loads. You might need to interact with the survey elements to trigger XSS in certain contexts if the payload is within answer options.
    9. **Inspect Source Code (Optional):** Right-click on the preview page and select "Inspect" or "View Page Source". Examine the HTML source code to confirm that the injected JavaScript payload is present in the HTML without proper encoding.

    **Expected Result:** If the alert boxes appear, the Stored XSS vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the injected JavaScript code in the "Survey Name", "Question 1", and "Answer 1a" fields was executed in the browser, demonstrating the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding throughout the application.
