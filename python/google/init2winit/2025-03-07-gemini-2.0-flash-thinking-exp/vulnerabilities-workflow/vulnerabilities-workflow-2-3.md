- vulnerability name: Path Traversal in Experiment Directory Creation
- description:
    1. The `init2winit` library uses a command-line flag `--experiment_dir` in `main.py` to specify the directory for saving experiment outputs.
    2. An attacker can manipulate this flag to include path traversal characters like `..` in the provided directory path.
    3. When the `main.py` script executes, it uses `tf.io.gfile.makedirs(trial_dir)` to create directories based on the user-provided `--experiment_dir` flag.
    4. By crafting a malicious `--experiment_dir` value, such as `--experiment_dir=/tmp/../../sensitive_dir/`, an attacker can potentially create directories outside of the intended `/tmp/test_mnist` or `/tmp/test_fake` experiment directories.
- impact:
    1. **Low:** Currently, the impact is limited to directory creation outside the intended experiment directory. While not directly leading to sensitive data exposure, it's a deviation from intended behavior and could be a building block for more severe attacks in future iterations of the project if file writing is introduced in these created directories.
- vulnerability rank: low
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no explicit mitigations implemented in the provided code to sanitize or validate the `--experiment_dir` flag.
- missing mitigations:
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for the `--experiment_dir` flag to prevent path traversal. This could involve:
        - Validating that the provided path is within an allowed base directory.
        - Sanitizing the path to remove or neutralize path traversal characters (e.g., `..`).
- preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute the `main.py` script and control the command-line arguments, which is typically the case for users or external attackers interacting with the library through its command-line interface.
- source code analysis:
    1. In `/code/init2winit/main.py`, the `experiment_dir` flag is defined:
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_string('experiment_dir', None,
                            'Path to save weights and other results. Each trial '
                            'directory will have path experiment_dir/worker_id/.')
        ```
    2. In the `main` function, the `experiment_dir` flag value is used to construct `trial_dir`:
        ```python
        trial_dir = os.path.join(experiment_dir, str(worker_id))
        ```
    3. `trial_dir` is then used in `makedirs` function:
        ```python
        makedirs(trial_dir, mode=0o775)
        ```
    4. `tf.io.gfile.makedirs` will create directories recursively, and it does not seem to have any built-in path traversal protection based on the documentation. This means if `experiment_dir` contains `..`, it will be interpreted literally, allowing directory creation outside the intended scope.

- security test case:
    1. Assume you have access to execute `main.py`.
    2. Execute the `main.py` script with a crafted `--experiment_dir` argument containing path traversal characters:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py --experiment_dir='/tmp/../../sensitive_dir/test_experiment' --num_train_steps=1 --dataset=fake
    ```
    3. After the script execution, check if the directory `/tmp/sensitive_dir/test_experiment/1` is created.
    4. If the directory is created, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability as the directory should ideally be created under `/tmp/test_experiment/1` and not outside of `/tmp/test_experiment`.
