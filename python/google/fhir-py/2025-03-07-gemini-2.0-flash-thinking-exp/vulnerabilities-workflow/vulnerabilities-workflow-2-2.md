- Vulnerability Name: FHIR Parsing Vulnerability
- Description: The project parses FHIR data, potentially from untrusted sources, to convert it into Protocol Buffers and use it in FHIR Views. If the FHIR parsing logic in `google-fhir-r4` or `google-fhir-views` is flawed, an attacker could craft a malicious FHIR resource that, when parsed by the library, leads to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior. This could include incorrect data processing, unexpected exceptions, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the parsing flaw. The vulnerability could be triggered when an application using this library processes a malicious FHIR resource provided by an attacker. For example, if a user of the library attempts to parse a FHIR resource from a potentially malicious source (e.g., user input, external system), and the library fails to properly handle certain edge cases or malformed data within the FHIR resource, it could lead to exploitable behavior.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of a FHIR parsing vulnerability could lead to various impacts depending on the context of the application using the library and the specific nature of the vulnerability. This may include data corruption, information disclosure if parsing errors expose sensitive data, or in more severe cases, potentially code execution if a parsing flaw can be leveraged to corrupt memory or control program flow. The impact is ranked as medium due to the potential for data corruption and information disclosure, although without deeper analysis, the full scope of impact is not known.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided files, there are no explicit mitigations mentioned for FHIR parsing vulnerabilities. The README files focus on functionality and usage rather than security considerations of the parsing process itself. The files in `google-fhir-core/google/fhir/core/internal/json_format/wrappers/` suggest there is custom parsing logic for FHIR primitives, which could be a source of vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization for FHIR resources, especially during JSON parsing and conversion to Protocol Buffers, is essential to prevent malicious data from causing harm.
  - Security testing and code reviews specifically focused on the FHIR parsing logic are needed to identify potential vulnerabilities.
  - Consideration of using well-vetted and hardened parsing libraries where possible, or rigorous testing of custom parsing components.
- Preconditions:
  - An application is using the `google-fhir-py` library to parse FHIR data.
  - The application processes FHIR resources from a potentially untrusted source that an attacker can control or influence.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The file `/code/google-fhir-r4/README.md` mentions "FHIR JSON to and from Protocol Buffers" and refers to the `json_format` package, indicating JSON parsing is a core feature.
  - The file `/code/google-fhir-core/google/fhir/core/internal/json_format/wrappers/README.md` describes "FHIR Primitive Wrappers" and "parsing" of "HL7 FHIR primitive JSON to a structured protobuf representation", suggesting a complex parsing logic that could contain vulnerabilities.
  - The file `/code/google-fhir-views/README.md` shows examples of using FHIRPath expressions on FHIR data, which implies that the library processes and interprets FHIR data structures, potentially creating further attack vectors.
  - Deeper source code analysis of `google-fhir-core/google/fhir/core/internal/json_format`, `google-fhir-r4/google/fhir/r4/json_format`, and `google-fhir-views` is needed to pinpoint specific parsing logic and identify potential flaws.
- Security Test Case:
  - Vulnerability Test Name: FHIR Parsing Vulnerability Test
  - Description: This test aims to verify if the `google-fhir-py` library is vulnerable to FHIR parsing vulnerabilities.
  - Preconditions:
    - A test environment with `google-fhir-views` library installed.
  - Steps:
    1. Create a malicious FHIR resource in JSON format. This resource should contain potentially problematic or malformed data designed to exploit common parsing vulnerabilities (e.g., very long strings, deeply nested structures, unexpected data types in fields, etc.). Example malicious JSON could include:
       ```json
       {
         "resourceType": "Patient",
         "id": "example",
         "name": [{
           "family": "MaliciouslyLongString..."
         }],
         // ... more potentially malicious fields ...
       }
       ```
       (The "MaliciouslyLongString..." should be replaced with a very long string, e.g., several megabytes, to test for buffer handling issues or excessive resource consumption during parsing.)
    2. Write a Python script that uses `google-fhir-py` library to parse this malicious FHIR resource. For example, using `google_fhir.r4.json_format.json_fhir_string_to_proto` to parse the JSON string into a `Patient` proto.
    3. Execute the Python script and observe the behavior.
  - Expected Result:
    - Ideally, the library should gracefully handle the malicious FHIR resource without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior. The parsing might fail with a clear error message indicating invalid FHIR, but it should not lead to exploitable conditions like uncontrolled resource consumption or exceptions that could be indicative of a parsing vulnerability.
    - If a vulnerability exists, the test might reveal:
      - A crash or unhandled exception during parsing.
      - Excessive memory or CPU usage during parsing, potentially leading to denial of service (though DoS is excluded from the vulnerability list, it can be an indicator of a parsing issue).
      - Incorrect parsing or data corruption, where the parsed proto is not as expected, indicating a potential logic flaw in parsing.
  - Vulnerability Confirmation: If the test case results in a crash, unhandled exception, or other abnormal behavior during parsing of the malicious FHIR resource, it confirms the presence of a FHIR parsing vulnerability. Further investigation and source code analysis would be required to determine the exact nature and severity of the vulnerability.
