## Combined Vulnerability Report

### 1. API Key Exposure in App Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. The application's authentication and administration interface requires an API key to interact with Google Cloud Scheduler API.
    2. The installation guide instructs users to directly embed this API key as plain text within the `app.yaml` configuration file.
    3. This practice of hardcoding sensitive credentials in configuration files, especially in files that might be inadvertently exposed (e.g., through version control or misconfigured deployments), creates a significant security risk.
    4. An attacker who gains access to the `app.yaml` file can easily retrieve the API key.
    5. Additionally, while App Engine environment variables are not directly exposed to the public internet, they are accessible to anyone who can access the App Engine instance's runtime environment. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the App Engine instance, they could potentially retrieve the API Key from the environment variables.

- **Impact:**
    - If an attacker obtains the API key, they can impersonate the application and make unauthorized calls to the Google Cloud Scheduler API.
    - This could allow the attacker to:
      - List, modify, delete, or create scheduled jobs within the project, potentially disrupting report fetching and loading processes.
      - Access sensitive information about existing report configurations and schedules.
      - Potentially escalate privileges or pivot to other GCP resources if the API key has broader permissions than intended.
      - Disrupt report fetching and loading processes by disabling or deleting jobs.
      - Potentially create malicious jobs to further compromise the system or resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Documentation in `/code/auth-appengine/README.md` guides users to configure the `app.yaml` file, including setting the `API_KEY`.
    - Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) is implemented for the `/code/auth-appengine/` application, which restricts access to the administration interface, potentially limiting unauthorized access to the `app.yaml` file through the deployed application. However, this does not prevent access from other vectors like compromised source code repository or misconfigured deployment pipelines.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Secure storage of the API key: Instead of hardcoding the API key in `app.yaml`, use Google Cloud Secret Manager to store the API key securely. The application should retrieve the API key from Secret Manager at runtime.
    - Secure API Key Storage: API keys should never be stored in plaintext configuration files. Implement secure storage mechanisms like Google Cloud Secret Manager to store and retrieve the API key. The application should retrieve the API key from Secret Manager at runtime instead of reading it from `app.yaml`.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the API key has the minimum necessary permissions required for the application to function. Restrict the scope of the API key to only the Cloud Scheduler API and limit the actions to only those necessary for Report2BQ.
    - Principle of Least Privilege for API Key:  The API key created for Report2BQ should be granted the minimum necessary permissions required for the application to function. Restrict the API key's scope to only the Cloud Scheduler API and only the specific actions required (e.g., list, get jobs).
    - Restrict API Key Scope:  Limit the scope of the API Key to the Cloud Scheduler API only. Ensure it does not have broader permissions that are not necessary for the App Engine application's functionality.
    - IAM for App Engine: Enforce strict IAM policies for the App Engine service account itself, limiting access to only authorized users and services.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `app.yaml` file containing the hardcoded API key is accessible to unauthorized users. This could happen if the file is:
      - Committed to a public version control repository.
      - Stored in an insecure location with overly permissive access controls.
      - Exposed due to misconfigured deployment pipelines or infrastructure.
    - Deployment of the `auth-appengine` application using `gcloud app deploy`.
    - Successful configuration of the `API_KEY` environment variable in `auth-appengine/app.yaml`.
    - Hypothetical unauthorized access to the App Engine instance's runtime environment.
    - An attacker needs to gain access to the `app.yaml` file in `/code/auth-appengine/`. This could be achieved through:
        - Compromising the source code repository where the project is hosted.
        - Exploiting a vulnerability in the App Engine application or deployment process that allows access to configuration files.
        - Social engineering or insider threat to gain access to the development/deployment environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml`
    2. Line 5: `API_KEY: ""` - This line in the application configuration file defines the environment variable `API_KEY` and its default value is an empty string, indicating that the user is expected to manually input the API Key here.
    3. File: `/code/auth-appengine/README.md`
    4. Section: "INSTALLATION GUIDE - Steps"
    5. Step 2: "Edit the `app.yaml` file ... Modify line 5 (`API_KEY: ""`) and copy/paste the API key ... into the API KEY between the quotation marks." - This instruction explicitly directs users to hardcode the API key into the `app.yaml` file, highlighting the vulnerability.
    6. File: `/code/auth-appengine/classes/scheduler.py`
    ```python
    class Scheduler(Fetcher):
      ...
      @decorators.lazy_property
      def service(self):
        """Creates the Scheduler service.

        Returns:
            googleapiclient.discovery.Resource: the service
        """
        return service_builder.build_service(service=services.Service.CLOUDSCHEDULER,
                                             key=self.credentials.credentials,
                                             api_key=os.environ['API_KEY'])
      ...
    ```
    7. The `Scheduler` class in `scheduler.py` retrieves the `API_KEY` from environment variables using `os.environ['API_KEY']` to initialize the Cloud Scheduler service.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Assume you have deployed Report2BQ authentication and administration interface and followed the instructions to set up the API key by hardcoding it in `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml`.
    2. **Step 1: Access `app.yaml`:** As an attacker, gain access to the `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        - **Scenario A: Public Repository:** If the repository containing the Report2BQ code and the `app.yaml` file is mistakenly made public on platforms like GitHub, navigate to the repository and locate the `app.yaml` file.
        - **Scenario B: Misconfigured Deployment:** If the application deployment process or infrastructure is misconfigured, it might be possible to access the deployed `app.yaml` file directly from the server or cloud environment.
    3. **Step 2: Extract API Key:** Open the `app.yaml` file and locate the line `API_KEY: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"`. Copy the value between the quotation marks; this is the exposed API key.
    4. **Step 3: Authenticate to Cloud Scheduler API:** Use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) or any other tool that can interact with Google Cloud APIs. Configure the tool to use the extracted API key for authentication. For example, using `curl`:
       ```bash
       API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
       PROJECT_ID="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"
       curl "https://cloudscheduler.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/jobs?key=$API_KEY"
       ```
       Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the extracted API key and `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with the GCP project ID where Report2BQ is deployed.
    5. **Step 4: Verify Unauthorized Access:** If the request in Step 4 is successful and returns a list of Cloud Scheduler jobs or allows manipulation of jobs, it confirms that the API key exposure vulnerability is valid. An attacker can now potentially exploit this access to perform malicious actions on the Cloud Scheduler, as described in the Impact section.
    6. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the `auth-appengine` application as described in the `README.md`.
        - Obtain access to the deployed App Engine instance (e.g., through compromised developer account or misconfiguration).
    7. **Steps:**
        - Access the App Engine instance's file system or configuration settings. The method to achieve this depends on the attacker's access level and the specific vulnerabilities they exploit (e.g., App Engine admin console, deployment pipeline access, or potential application vulnerabilities).
        - Locate and open the `app.yaml` file within the App Engine deployment.
        - Examine the content of the `app.yaml` file.
        - Observe the value associated with the `API_KEY` environment variable.
    8. **Expected Result:**
        - The `API_KEY` environment variable in `app.yaml` will contain the plaintext API key that was configured during the installation process. This confirms the vulnerability.

### 2. Potential Unauthenticated Access to Admin Cloud Functions

- **Description:**
    1. The `admin-chat-app` component deploys several Cloud Functions, including `report2bq-admin`, `report2bq-oauth-start`, and `report2bq-oauth-complete`.
    2. The `install.sh` script for `admin-chat-app` uses the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag when deploying these Cloud Functions. This flag, at first glance, suggests that these functions are intended to be accessible without authentication at the HTTP level.
    3. While the App Engine administration interface is secured by Identity Aware Proxy (IAP), it's not immediately clear if the Cloud Functions, particularly `report2bq-admin`, rely solely on OAuth within their code for authorization or if they are genuinely exposed without any authentication.
    4. If the `report2bq-admin` function lacks proper authentication and authorization checks beyond just relying on OAuth (which might be bypassed if the function is directly accessed), an attacker who discovers or guesses the function's URL could potentially trigger administrative actions without proper credentials.

- **Impact:**
    - If the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function is indeed accessible without authentication, an attacker could:
      - List existing report jobs, potentially gaining insights into report configurations and schedules.
      - Create, modify, or delete report jobs, disrupting the intended operation of Report2BQ and potentially leading to unauthorized data access or exfiltration if malicious jobs are created.
      - Exploit any other administrative functionalities exposed through this Cloud Function.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - OAuth flow is implemented within the `admin-chat-app/main.py` to handle user authentication for chat-based commands. The `start_oauth` and `complete_oauth` functions manage the OAuth 2.0 flow.
    - Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) is enabled and configured for the App Engine application, securing access to the primary administration interface.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Explicit Authorization Checks within `report2bq-admin`: It's crucial to verify if the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function, despite using OAuth, also implements robust authorization checks within its code logic. These checks should go beyond just OAuth and ensure that the authenticated user has the necessary roles or permissions to perform the requested administrative actions.
    - Clarification on `--allow-unauthenticated`: The use of `--allow-unauthenticated` flag in `install.sh` needs to be carefully reviewed and justified. If the intention is to rely solely on OAuth for security, the documentation and code comments should clearly reflect this, and the function's code must strictly enforce OAuth-based authorization. If `--allow-unauthenticated` is indeed necessary for certain OAuth flows to function correctly, it must be explicitly documented and the security implications thoroughly assessed.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The URL of the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function is publicly known or can be easily discovered by an attacker. This might occur through:
      - Information leakage in documentation, configuration files, or error messages.
      - Brute-forcing or guessing Cloud Function URLs, which sometimes follow predictable patterns.
      - Insider knowledge or access to internal systems where Cloud Function URLs are stored.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/admin-chat-app/install.sh`
    2. Lines deploying Cloud Functions (`report2bq-oauth-start`, `report2bq-oauth-complete`, `report2bq-admin`): Each `gcloud functions deploy` command includes the flag `--allow-unauthenticated`. This flag, by default, makes the deployed Cloud Function accessible without requiring authentication.
    3. File: `/code/admin-chat-app/main.py`
    4. `report2bq_admin` function: This is the entry point for the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function. It calls `Report2BQ().process(req=request_json)`. Further analysis of `Report2BQ().process()` and related classes is necessary to determine if sufficient authorization checks are performed within the code logic to compensate for the `--allow-unauthenticated` setting.
    5. OAuth flow: The presence of `start_oauth` and `complete_oauth` functions indicates that OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication, but it needs to be confirmed if this OAuth flow is correctly and effectively integrated into the `report2bq-admin` function to enforce authorization for all administrative actions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Assume you have deployed the `admin-chat-app` component using `install.sh`, which includes deploying the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function with the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag. Obtain the URL of the deployed `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function.
    2. **Step 1: Direct Function Access:** As an attacker, attempt to directly access the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function endpoint using a tool like `curl` or a web browser. Do not go through the Google Chat interface or any intended OAuth flow.
    3. **Step 2: Craft Malicious Request:** Construct a malicious JSON payload that mimics a valid request to trigger administrative actions. For example, try to list existing jobs by sending a JSON payload similar to what a Google Chat slash command might generate:
       ```json
       {
         "type": "MESSAGE",
         "message": {
           "text": "/list",
           "slashCommand": {
             "commandName": "/list"
           }
         },
         "user": {
           "email": "attacker@example.com"
         }
       }
       ```
    4. **Step 3: Send POST Request:** Send a POST request to the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function URL with the crafted JSON payload. You can use `curl`:
       ```bash
       FUNCTION_URL="<YOUR_REPORT2BQ_ADMIN_FUNCTION_URL>"
       PAYLOAD='{
         "type": "MESSAGE",
         "message": {
           "text": "/list",
           "slashCommand": {
             "commandName": "/list"
           }
         },
         "user": {
           "email": "attacker@example.com"
         }
       }'
       curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$PAYLOAD" "$FUNCTION_URL"
       ```
       Replace `<YOUR_REPORT2BQ_ADMIN_FUNCTION_URL>` with the actual URL of the deployed Cloud Function.
    5. **Step 4: Analyze Response:** Examine the response from the Cloud Function.
        - **Vulnerable Outcome:** If the function executes the administrative action (e.g., returns a list of jobs) and does not reject the request due to missing or invalid authentication/authorization, it indicates a potential vulnerability. This would mean that despite the OAuth flow being in place for Google Chat interaction, direct access to the Cloud Function bypasses these security measures.
        - **Mitigated Outcome:** If the function correctly identifies the lack of proper authentication or authorization and returns an error (e.g., "Unauthorized", "Authentication required"), it suggests that the OAuth flow or other authorization mechanisms are effectively securing the Cloud Function, even with `--allow-unauthenticated` flag set at the HTTP level. In this case, further investigation would be needed to understand how the OAuth flow is enforced and if there are any other bypass possibilities.

### 3. Cloud Function Service Account Over-Permissive IAM Roles

- **Description:**
    1. The `install.sh` script automatically creates a service account (`report2bq@<PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for Cloud Functions and grants it the `roles/editor` role.
    2. The `roles/editor` role is a highly permissive IAM role that grants broad access to Google Cloud resources within the project.
    3. If an attacker were to compromise the Cloud Functions (e.g., through a hypothetical vulnerability in the Cloud Functions runtime or by exploiting a misconfiguration), they would inherit the permissions of this service account.
    4. This overly broad `roles/editor` permission would allow the attacker to access and modify almost any resource within the Google Cloud project, going far beyond the intended scope of accessing advertising reports in BigQuery.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**. Full project compromise. An attacker could gain complete control over the Google Cloud project, including:
        - Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from any Google Cloud service within the project (e.g., databases, storage buckets, other applications).
        - Modifying or deleting critical infrastructure and data.
        - Using project resources for malicious purposes (e.g., crypto mining, launching further attacks).
        - Impersonating other service accounts or users within the project.
        - **High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive advertising data stored in BigQuery.
        - **High**. Potential data breach and loss of confidentiality of advertising reports.
        - **Medium**. Potential for data manipulation or deletion in BigQuery by an attacker.
        - **Medium**.  Increased risk of lateral movement within the GCP project due to overly broad permissions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `install.sh` script explicitly grants the overly permissive `roles/editor` role.
    - Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) for Admin Interface: The `auth-appengine` module uses IAP to control access to the administration interface, as documented in `/code/auth-appengine/README.md`. This limits unauthorized access to the job management UI but does not restrict the service account's permissions.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Replace the `roles/editor` role with a custom IAM role that grants only the necessary permissions for the Cloud Functions to operate. This custom role should be restricted to:
        - Writing data to the designated BigQuery dataset.
        - Reading secrets from Secret Manager (for API keys and OAuth credentials).
        - Publishing messages to Pub/Sub topics.
        - Potentially logging and monitoring permissions.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for Service Account:** The service account should be granted only the minimum necessary IAM roles required for Report2BQ to function.
    - **Restrict Service Account Roles:** Instead of `roles/editor`, the service account should be granted more granular roles such as:
        - `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`: To write data to BigQuery datasets.
        - `roles/bigquery.jobUser`: To run BigQuery jobs.
        - `roles/pubsub.publisher`: To publish messages to Pub/Sub topics.
        - `roles/pubsub.subscriber`: To subscribe to Pub/Sub topics.
        - `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`: To access secrets in Secret Manager.
        - `roles/cloudfunctions.invoker`: To invoke other Cloud Functions (if needed).
        - `roles/storage.objectCreator`: To write objects to GCS buckets.
        - `roles/storage.objectViewer`: To read objects from GCS buckets.
    - **Regular Security Audits**: Implement regular reviews of IAM roles and permissions to identify and rectify any instances of over-permissioning.
    - **Regular IAM Role Reviews:** Implement a process to periodically review and refine the IAM roles assigned to the service account to ensure they remain least privilege.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Successful deployment of Report2BQ using the `install.sh` script with the `--create-service-account` option, or manual creation of the service account with `roles/editor` role.
    - Hypothetical compromise of the Cloud Functions runtime environment or exploitation of a misconfiguration leading to service account key exposure.
    - Report2BQ project is installed using the default `install.sh` script, which grants the `roles/editor` role to the service account.
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Cloud Function within the Report2BQ project. This could be through various means, including but not limited to exploiting a code vulnerability (not identified in provided files but theoretically possible in any application), social engineering, or insider threat.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/application/install.sh`
    ```bash
    if [ ${CREATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT} -eq 1 ]; then
      USER=report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts create report2bq --description "Report2BQ Service Account" \
      && ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts keys create "report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com.json" --iam-account ${USER}
      ${DRY_RUN} gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} --member=serviceAccount:${USER} --role=roles/editor
    fi
    ```
    - The code snippet clearly shows the assignment of `roles/editor` to the service account.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        install.sh --> gcloud iam service-accounts create report2bq
                   --> gcloud iam service-accounts keys create
                   --> gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding --role=roles/editor
        ```
    2. **`/code/application/install.sh`:**
        ```bash
        if [ ${CREATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT} -eq 1 ]; then
          USER=report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
          ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts create report2bq --description "Report2BQ Service Account" \
          && ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts keys create "report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com.json" --iam-account ${USER}
          ${DRY_RUN} gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} --member=serviceAccount:${USER} --role=roles/editor
        fi
        ```
        * This section of the `install.sh` script explicitly grants the `roles/editor` role to the `report2bq` service account.
        * The `--role=roles/editor` parameter in the `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` command is the source of the overly permissive role assignment.
    3. **Review of other files:** No other files in the provided project files explicitly mitigate this vulnerability or restrict the service account's IAM role to a less permissive one. The documentation in `auth-appengine/README.md` focuses on securing the admin interface with IAP, which is a separate security control and does not address the service account's broad permissions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy Report2BQ using `install.sh --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --dataset=<DATASET_NAME> --api-key=<API_KEY> --create-service-account --activate-apis --deploy-all`.
    2. Identify the service account email address created by the script (report2bq@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com).
    3. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "IAM".
    4. Search for the service account email address.
    5. Observe that the service account has the "Editor" role assigned at the project level.
    6. **Simulate Cloud Function Compromise (for testing purposes only in a controlled environment):**
        -  Assume you have gained access to the Cloud Function's execution environment (this step is for demonstration and is not intended to be a real exploit).
        -  Within the Cloud Function environment, use the service account credentials to attempt to access other Google Cloud resources in the project, such as:
            - List storage buckets: `gsutil ls gs://`
            - List BigQuery datasets: `bq ls`
            - Read secrets from Secret Manager: `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=<SOME_SECRET>`
        -  If successful, this demonstrates that the `roles/editor` role grants excessive permissions, allowing an attacker to move laterally within the Google Cloud project and access resources far beyond the intended scope of Report2BQ.
    7. **Deploy Report2BQ:** Run the `install.sh` script with default parameters in a test GCP project.
    8. **Identify Service Account:** After installation, navigate to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section in the Google Cloud Console for the deployed project. Locate the service account `report2bq@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
    9. **Check Granted Roles:** Click on the service account to view its details and the "Permissions" tab.
    10. **Verify `roles/editor` Role:** Confirm that the `roles/editor` role is listed under "Granted roles" for the service account.
    11. **Attempt Unauthorized Actions (Simulated):**  While a full exploit requires compromising a Cloud Function, you can simulate the impact by:
        * Using the service account's credentials (download the key if needed, which is not recommended for production but acceptable for testing in a secure test project) to attempt actions that should be outside the scope of Report2BQ's intended functionality.
        * For example, try to list all BigQuery datasets in the project, create a new BigQuery dataset, or read data from a different BigQuery dataset in the same project using the service account's credentials and the `bq` command-line tool or GCP APIs.
        * If these actions are successful, it demonstrates the overly permissive nature of the `roles/editor` role and confirms the vulnerability.
    12. **Remediation Test:**
        * In the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section, edit the permissions of the `report2bq` service account.
        * Remove the `roles/editor` role.
        * Add the more restrictive roles listed in "Missing Mitigations" (e.g., `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`, `roles/bigquery.jobUser`, etc.).
        * Re-run the simulated unauthorized actions from step 5. Verify that these actions are now denied due to insufficient permissions, while Report2BQ's core functionality (fetching reports and loading to BigQuery) remains operational (this would require functional testing of Report2BQ, which is outside the scope of this specific test case but crucial for a full security assessment).

### 4. Potential for Postprocessor Code Injection via GCS Bucket

- **Description:**
    1. The Report2BQ postprocessor feature allows users to upload custom Python code to a designated GCS bucket (`[project]-report2bq-postprocessor`).
    2. The `report2bq-postprocessor` Cloud Function dynamically loads and executes Python files from this bucket based on the `--message` parameter provided during job creation.
    3. If an attacker gains write access to the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` bucket, they could upload malicious Python code.
    4. When a Report2BQ job with a `--message` parameter corresponding to the attacker's malicious file is executed, the `report2bq-postprocessor` function will load and execute the attacker's code.
    5. Since postprocessors have "full access to the system," as documented in `POSTPROCESSOR.md`, this code injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Cloud Functions environment, potentially escalating to broader project compromise if combined with overly permissive IAM roles (Vulnerability #3).

- **Impact:**
    - **High to Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could:
        - Execute arbitrary Python code within the Cloud Functions environment.
        - Potentially gain access to sensitive data and resources within the Google Cloud project, depending on the permissions of the Cloud Function's service account (Vulnerability #3 exacerbates this).
        - Modify or delete data and infrastructure.
        - Use the compromised Cloud Function environment for further attacks.
        - The severity depends heavily on the permissions of the Cloud Function's service account and the extent of access the attacker can gain to other resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Warning**: The `POSTPROCESSOR.md` documentation includes a warning: "`Postprocessor`s have full access to the system, so should be treated with care...". However, this is a weak mitigation as it relies on users' awareness and diligence.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Restrict Bucket Write Access**: Implement strict IAM policies on the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` bucket, limiting write access to only highly trusted and authorized users or service accounts. General users should not have write access to this bucket.
    - **Code Review and Scanning**: Establish a process for reviewing and scanning postprocessor code before it is uploaded to the bucket. This could involve manual code review or automated static analysis security testing (SAST) tools.
    - **Input Validation and Sandboxing (Partial Mitigation)**: While full sandboxing of dynamically loaded Python code is complex, consider implementing basic input validation or security checks within the `report2bq-postprocessor` function to mitigate some common code injection attack vectors. However, this should not be considered a primary mitigation against malicious code uploaded by a determined attacker.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (Reiteration)**: Ensure that the Cloud Functions service account running `report2bq-postprocessor` has the least privilege necessary to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting it overly broad roles like `roles/editor` (see Vulnerability #3).

- **Preconditions:**
    - Report2BQ installation with the postprocessor feature enabled.
    - Write access to the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` GCS bucket for the attacker.
    - Creation of a Report2BQ job (e.g., using `create_fetcher.sh`) with the `--message` parameter set to the name of the attacker's malicious Python file in the bucket.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/application/POSTPROCESSOR.md`
    ```markdown
    `Postprocessor`s have full access to the system, so should be treated with care,
    but they can be a powerful addition to your Report2BQ installation.
    ...
    ## DEPLOYING A `POSTPROCESSOR`

    Copy the python file to the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` bucket.

    ## CALLING THE DEPLOYED `POSTPROCESSOR`

    Create your `fetcher` job with the `--message` parameter. The value of
    `--message` should be the name of the python file, without the extension.
    ```
    - The documentation explicitly states that postprocessors have "full access to the system" and instructs users to deploy them by copying Python files to the GCS bucket.
    2. File: `/code/application/main.py`
    ```python
    def post_processor(event: Dict[str, Any], context=None) -> None:
      """Runs the post processor function.
      ...
      if event_data := event.get('data'):
        module_name = base64.b64decode(event_data).decode('utf-8')
        logging.info('Loading and running %s', module_name)

        if attributes := event.get('attributes'):
          processor = PostProcessor.install(module_name=module_name,
                                            class_name='Processor',
                                            storage=dynamic.CloudStorage,
                                            bucket='report2bq-postprocessor')
          try:
            processor().run(context=context, **attributes)
          ...
    ```
    - The `post_processor` Cloud Function retrieves the postprocessor module name from the Pub/Sub event data, decodes it, and then dynamically loads and executes code from the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` bucket using `PostProcessor.install()` and `processor().run()`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Gain Write Access to GCS Bucket (for testing purposes only in a controlled environment):**
        -  Assume you have obtained write access to the `[project]-report2bq-postprocessor` GCS bucket (this step is for demonstration and is not intended to be a real exploit). In a real-world scenario, this would represent a serious misconfiguration or vulnerability.
    2. **Create Malicious Postprocessor Code:**
        - Create a Python file (e.g., `malicious_postprocessor.py`) with malicious code. For example, code that attempts to read a secret from Secret Manager and log it:
            ```python
            import logging
            import os
            from classes.postprocessor import PostProcessor
            from google.cloud import secretmanager

            class Processor(PostProcessor):
              def run(self, context=None, **attributes: Mapping[str, str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
                logging.info("Malicious Postprocessor Running!")
                try:
                  client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
                  secret_name = "projects/<YOUR_PROJECT>/secrets/<YOUR_SECRET>/versions/latest" # Replace with a secret in your project
                  response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": secret_name})
                  payload = response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
                  logging.error(f"Secret Value: {payload}") # In real attack, exfiltrate, don't just log
                except Exception as e:
                  logging.error(f"Error accessing secret: {e}")
                return {}
            ```
        - **Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT>` and `<YOUR_SECRET>` with your Google Cloud project ID and the name of a Secret Manager secret you have created for testing (or use a dummy secret for safety).**
    3. **Upload Malicious Code to GCS Bucket:**
        - Use `gsutil cp malicious_postprocessor.py gs://<YOUR_PROJECT>-report2bq-postprocessor/` to upload the malicious Python file to the designated GCS bucket.
    4. **Create Report2BQ Job with Malicious Postprocessor:**
        - Use `create_fetcher.sh` or `create_runner.sh` to create a Report2BQ job, specifying the `--message` parameter with the name of your malicious file (e.g., `--message malicious_postprocessor`).
        ```bash
        ./create_fetcher.sh --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --email="test@example.com" --report-id="12345" --message malicious_postprocessor
        ```
    5. **Trigger Report2BQ Job:**
        - Trigger the Report2BQ job (e.g., wait for the scheduled run, or manually trigger it if possible).
    6. **Check Cloud Function Logs:**
        - After the job executes, check the logs for the `report2bq-postprocessor` Cloud Function in the Google Cloud Console (Cloud Logging).
        - If the malicious code was successfully injected and executed, you should see log entries from your malicious code (e.g., "Malicious Postprocessor Running!" and potentially the secret value if you used a real secret for testing).
    7. This test case demonstrates that an attacker with write access to the postprocessor bucket can achieve Remote Code Execution by uploading and triggering malicious postprocessor code.
