- Vulnerability Name: API Key Exposure in App Configuration
  - Description:
    1. The application's authentication and administration interface requires an API key to interact with Google Cloud Scheduler API.
    2. The installation guide instructs users to directly embed this API key as plain text within the `app.yaml` configuration file.
    3. This practice of hardcoding sensitive credentials in configuration files, especially in files that might be inadvertently exposed (e.g., through version control or misconfigured deployments), creates a significant security risk.
    4. An attacker who gains access to the `app.yaml` file can easily retrieve the API key.
  - Impact:
    - If an attacker obtains the API key, they can impersonate the application and make unauthorized calls to the Google Cloud Scheduler API.
    - This could allow the attacker to:
      - List, modify, delete, or create scheduled jobs within the project, potentially disrupting report fetching and loading processes.
      - Access sensitive information about existing report configurations and schedules.
      - Potentially escalate privileges or pivot to other GCP resources if the API key has broader permissions than intended.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation in `/code/auth-appengine/README.md` guides users to configure the `app.yaml` file, including setting the `API_KEY`. However, this is not a code-level mitigation and relies on user diligence.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure storage of the API key: Instead of hardcoding the API key in `app.yaml`, use Google Cloud Secret Manager to store the API key securely. The application should retrieve the API key from Secret Manager at runtime.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the API key has the minimum necessary permissions required for the application to function. Restrict the scope of the API key to only the Cloud Scheduler API and limit the actions to only those necessary for Report2BQ.
  - Preconditions:
    - The `app.yaml` file containing the hardcoded API key is accessible to unauthorized users. This could happen if the file is:
      - Committed to a public version control repository.
      - Stored in an insecure location with overly permissive access controls.
      - Exposed due to misconfigured deployment pipelines or infrastructure.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml`
    2. Line 5: `API_KEY: ""` - This line in the application configuration file defines the environment variable `API_KEY` and its default value is an empty string, indicating that the user is expected to manually input the API Key here.
    3. File: `/code/auth-appengine/README.md`
    4. Section: "INSTALLATION GUIDE - Steps"
    5. Step 2: "Edit the `app.yaml` file ... Modify line 5 (`API_KEY: ""`) and copy/paste the API key ... into the API KEY between the quotation marks." - This instruction explicitly directs users to hardcode the API key into the `app.yaml` file, highlighting the vulnerability.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Assume you have deployed Report2BQ authentication and administration interface and followed the instructions to set up the API key by hardcoding it in `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml`.
    2. **Step 1: Access `app.yaml`:** As an attacker, gain access to the `/code/auth-appengine/app.yaml` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        - **Scenario A: Public Repository:** If the repository containing the Report2BQ code and the `app.yaml` file is mistakenly made public on platforms like GitHub, navigate to the repository and locate the `app.yaml` file.
        - **Scenario B: Misconfigured Deployment:** If the application deployment process or infrastructure is misconfigured, it might be possible to access the deployed `app.yaml` file directly from the server or cloud environment.
    3. **Step 2: Extract API Key:** Open the `app.yaml` file and locate the line `API_KEY: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"`. Copy the value between the quotation marks; this is the exposed API key.
    4. **Step 3: Authenticate to Cloud Scheduler API:** Use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) or any other tool that can interact with Google Cloud APIs. Configure the tool to use the extracted API key for authentication. For example, using `curl`:
       ```bash
       API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
       PROJECT_ID="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"
       curl "https://cloudscheduler.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/jobs?key=$API_KEY"
       ```
       Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the extracted API key and `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with the GCP project ID where Report2BQ is deployed.
    5. **Step 4: Verify Unauthorized Access:** If the request in Step 4 is successful and returns a list of Cloud Scheduler jobs or allows manipulation of jobs, it confirms that the API key exposure vulnerability is valid. An attacker can now potentially exploit this access to perform malicious actions on the Cloud Scheduler, as described in the Impact section.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Unauthenticated Access to Admin Cloud Functions
  - Description:
    1. The `admin-chat-app` component deploys several Cloud Functions, including `report2bq-admin`, `report2bq-oauth-start`, and `report2bq-oauth-complete`.
    2. The `install.sh` script for `admin-chat-app` uses the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag when deploying these Cloud Functions. This flag, at first glance, suggests that these functions are intended to be accessible without authentication at the HTTP level.
    3. While the App Engine administration interface is secured by Identity Aware Proxy (IAP), it's not immediately clear if the Cloud Functions, particularly `report2bq-admin`, rely solely on OAuth within their code for authorization or if they are genuinely exposed without any authentication.
    4. If the `report2bq-admin` function lacks proper authentication and authorization checks beyond just relying on OAuth (which might be bypassed if the function is directly accessed), an attacker who discovers or guesses the function's URL could potentially trigger administrative actions without proper credentials.
  - Impact:
    - If the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function is indeed accessible without authentication, an attacker could:
      - List existing report jobs, potentially gaining insights into report configurations and schedules.
      - Create, modify, or delete report jobs, disrupting the intended operation of Report2BQ and potentially leading to unauthorized data access or exfiltration if malicious jobs are created.
      - Exploit any other administrative functionalities exposed through this Cloud Function.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - OAuth flow is implemented within the `admin-chat-app/main.py` to handle user authentication for chat-based commands. The `start_oauth` and `complete_oauth` functions manage the OAuth 2.0 flow.
    - Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) is enabled and configured for the App Engine application, securing access to the primary administration interface.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicit Authorization Checks within `report2bq-admin`: It's crucial to verify if the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function, despite using OAuth, also implements robust authorization checks within its code logic. These checks should go beyond just OAuth and ensure that the authenticated user has the necessary roles or permissions to perform the requested administrative actions.
    - Clarification on `--allow-unauthenticated`: The use of `--allow-unauthenticated` flag in `install.sh` needs to be carefully reviewed and justified. If the intention is to rely solely on OAuth for security, the documentation and code comments should clearly reflect this, and the function's code must strictly enforce OAuth-based authorization. If `--allow-unauthenticated` is indeed necessary for certain OAuth flows to function correctly, it must be explicitly documented and the security implications thoroughly assessed.
  - Preconditions:
    - The URL of the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function is publicly known or can be easily discovered by an attacker. This might occur through:
      - Information leakage in documentation, configuration files, or error messages.
      - Brute-forcing or guessing Cloud Function URLs, which sometimes follow predictable patterns.
      - Insider knowledge or access to internal systems where Cloud Function URLs are stored.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/admin-chat-app/install.sh`
    2. Lines deploying Cloud Functions (`report2bq-oauth-start`, `report2bq-oauth-complete`, `report2bq-admin`): Each `gcloud functions deploy` command includes the flag `--allow-unauthenticated`. This flag, by default, makes the deployed Cloud Function accessible without requiring authentication.
    3. File: `/code/admin-chat-app/main.py`
    4. `report2bq_admin` function: This is the entry point for the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function. It calls `Report2BQ().process(req=request_json)`. Further analysis of `Report2BQ().process()` and related classes is necessary to determine if sufficient authorization checks are performed within the code logic to compensate for the `--allow-unauthenticated` setting.
    5. OAuth flow: The presence of `start_oauth` and `complete_oauth` functions indicates that OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication, but it needs to be confirmed if this OAuth flow is correctly and effectively integrated into the `report2bq-admin` function to enforce authorization for all administrative actions.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Assume you have deployed the `admin-chat-app` component using `install.sh`, which includes deploying the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function with the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag. Obtain the URL of the deployed `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function.
    2. **Step 1: Direct Function Access:** As an attacker, attempt to directly access the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function endpoint using a tool like `curl` or a web browser. Do not go through the Google Chat interface or any intended OAuth flow.
    3. **Step 2: Craft Malicious Request:** Construct a malicious JSON payload that mimics a valid request to trigger administrative actions. For example, try to list existing jobs by sending a JSON payload similar to what a Google Chat slash command might generate:
       ```json
       {
         "type": "MESSAGE",
         "message": {
           "text": "/list",
           "slashCommand": {
             "commandName": "/list"
           }
         },
         "user": {
           "email": "attacker@example.com"
         }
       }
       ```
    4. **Step 3: Send POST Request:** Send a POST request to the `report2bq-admin` Cloud Function URL with the crafted JSON payload. You can use `curl`:
       ```bash
       FUNCTION_URL="<YOUR_REPORT2BQ_ADMIN_FUNCTION_URL>"
       PAYLOAD='{
         "type": "MESSAGE",
         "message": {
           "text": "/list",
           "slashCommand": {
             "commandName": "/list"
           }
         },
         "user": {
           "email": "attacker@example.com"
         }
       }'
       curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$PAYLOAD" "$FUNCTION_URL"
       ```
       Replace `<YOUR_REPORT2BQ_ADMIN_FUNCTION_URL>` with the actual URL of the deployed Cloud Function.
    5. **Step 4: Analyze Response:** Examine the response from the Cloud Function.
        - **Vulnerable Outcome:** If the function executes the administrative action (e.g., returns a list of jobs) and does not reject the request due to missing or invalid authentication/authorization, it indicates a potential vulnerability. This would mean that despite the OAuth flow being in place for Google Chat interaction, direct access to the Cloud Function bypasses these security measures.
        - **Mitigated Outcome:** If the function correctly identifies the lack of proper authentication or authorization and returns an error (e.g., "Unauthorized", "Authentication required"), it suggests that the OAuth flow or other authorization mechanisms are effectively securing the Cloud Function, even with `--allow-unauthenticated` flag set at the HTTP level. In this case, further investigation would be needed to understand how the OAuth flow is enforced and if there are any other bypass possibilities.
