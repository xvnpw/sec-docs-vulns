- Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Service Account Role

- Description:
    1. The `install.sh` script automatically creates a service account (`report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for the Cloud Functions.
    2. This script grants the `roles/editor` IAM role to this service account.
    3. The `roles/editor` role is a highly permissive role in GCP, granting broad access to manage project resources.
    4. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to a Cloud Function (e.g., by exploiting a different vulnerability or through insider threat), the attacker inherits the permissions of the service account associated with that Cloud Function.
    5. With `roles/editor` permissions, the attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive advertising data in BigQuery, as well as perform other actions on GCP resources within the project, going beyond the intended scope of Report2BQ's functionality.

- Impact:
    * **High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive advertising data stored in BigQuery.
    * **High**. Potential data breach and loss of confidentiality of advertising reports.
    * **Medium**. Potential for data manipulation or deletion in BigQuery by an attacker.
    * **Medium**.  Increased risk of lateral movement within the GCP project due to overly broad permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * **Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) for Admin Interface:** The `auth-appengine` module uses IAP to control access to the administration interface, as documented in `/code/auth-appengine/README.md`. This limits unauthorized access to the job management UI but does not restrict the service account's permissions.

- Missing Mitigations:
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Service Account:** The service account should be granted only the minimum necessary IAM roles required for Report2BQ to function.
    * **Restrict Service Account Roles:** Instead of `roles/editor`, the service account should be granted more granular roles such as:
        * `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`: To write data to BigQuery datasets.
        * `roles/bigquery.jobUser`: To run BigQuery jobs.
        * `roles/pubsub.publisher`: To publish messages to Pub/Sub topics.
        * `roles/pubsub.subscriber`: To subscribe to Pub/Sub topics.
        * `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`: To access secrets in Secret Manager.
        * `roles/cloudfunctions.invoker`: To invoke other Cloud Functions (if needed).
        * `roles/storage.objectCreator`: To write objects to GCS buckets.
        * `roles/storage.objectViewer`: To read objects from GCS buckets.
    * **Regular IAM Role Reviews:** Implement a process to periodically review and refine the IAM roles assigned to the service account to ensure they remain least privilege.

- Preconditions:
    * Report2BQ project is installed using the default `install.sh` script, which grants the `roles/editor` role to the service account.
    * An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Cloud Function within the Report2BQ project. This could be through various means, including but not limited to exploiting a code vulnerability (not identified in provided files but theoretically possible in any application), social engineering, or insider threat.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`/code/application/install.sh`:**
        ```bash
        if [ ${CREATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT} -eq 1 ]; then
          USER=report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
          ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts create report2bq --description "Report2BQ Service Account" \
          && ${DRY_RUN} gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts keys create "report2bq@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com.json" --iam-account ${USER}
          ${DRY_RUN} gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} --member=serviceAccount:${USER} --role=roles/editor
        fi
        ```
        * This section of the `install.sh` script explicitly grants the `roles/editor` role to the `report2bq` service account.
        * The `--role=roles/editor` parameter in the `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` command is the source of the overly permissive role assignment.
    2. **Review of other files:** No other files in the provided project files explicitly mitigate this vulnerability or restrict the service account's IAM role to a less permissive one. The documentation in `auth-appengine/README.md` focuses on securing the admin interface with IAP, which is a separate security control and does not address the service account's broad permissions.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Deploy Report2BQ:** Run the `install.sh` script with default parameters in a test GCP project.
    2. **Identify Service Account:** After installation, navigate to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section in the Google Cloud Console for the deployed project. Locate the service account `report2bq@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
    3. **Check Granted Roles:** Click on the service account to view its details and the "Permissions" tab.
    4. **Verify `roles/editor` Role:** Confirm that the `roles/editor` role is listed under "Granted roles" for the service account.
    5. **Attempt Unauthorized Actions (Simulated):**  While a full exploit requires compromising a Cloud Function, you can simulate the impact by:
        * Using the service account's credentials (download the key if needed, which is not recommended for production but acceptable for testing in a secure test project) to attempt actions that should be outside the scope of Report2BQ's intended functionality.
        * For example, try to list all BigQuery datasets in the project, create a new BigQuery dataset, or read data from a different BigQuery dataset in the same project using the service account's credentials and the `bq` command-line tool or GCP APIs.
        * If these actions are successful, it demonstrates the overly permissive nature of the `roles/editor` role and confirms the vulnerability.
    6. **Remediation Test:**
        * In the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section, edit the permissions of the `report2bq` service account.
        * Remove the `roles/editor` role.
        * Add the more restrictive roles listed in "Missing Mitigations" (e.g., `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`, `roles/bigquery.jobUser`, etc.).
        * Re-run the simulated unauthorized actions from step 5. Verify that these actions are now denied due to insufficient permissions, while Report2BQ's core functionality (fetching reports and loading to BigQuery) remains operational (this would require functional testing of Report2BQ, which is outside the scope of this specific test case but crucial for a full security assessment).
