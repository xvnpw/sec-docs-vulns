- Vulnerability Name: Potential Buffer Overflow in Firmware Input Handling
- Description:
    - The firmware source code, likely written in C/C++ for various keyboard projects, is responsible for handling input from different sources such as key presses, sensors, and communication interfaces (USB, Bluetooth).
    - If the firmware does not properly validate the size and format of input data before processing it, a buffer overflow vulnerability could occur.
    - Specifically, if the firmware copies input data into fixed-size buffers without checking the input length, an attacker could send specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer's capacity.
    - This could overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting program data or code execution flow.
    - For example, if the firmware receives key input via USB HID reports and processes character strings without bounds checking, sending an overly long string could trigger a buffer overflow.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the microcontroller.
    - An attacker could gain control of the keyboard's functionality, potentially:
        - Injecting arbitrary keystrokes to the connected host system.
        - Modifying the keyboard's behavior for malicious purposes.
        - Potentially using the keyboard as a platform to launch further attacks on the host system, depending on the microcontroller's capabilities and connection to the host.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The provided project documentation does not explicitly mention any specific buffer overflow mitigations implemented in the firmware.
    - Standard C/C++ programming practices *may* be assumed, but without examining the firmware source code, the effectiveness of any implicit or assumed mitigations cannot be verified.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation checks in the firmware to ensure that all input data conforms to expected size and format limits before processing.
    - **Bounds Checking:** Employ bounds checking mechanisms when copying input data into buffers to prevent writing beyond buffer boundaries.
    - **Safe String Handling Functions:** Utilize safe string handling functions (e.g., `strncpy`, `snprintf` in C/C++) that prevent buffer overflows, instead of functions like `strcpy` or `sprintf` that are prone to them.
    - **Memory Protection:** If the target microcontroller architecture supports memory protection units (MPUs) or similar features, consider using them to isolate memory regions and limit the impact of potential overflows.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must build a physical keyboard based on one of the provided project designs (e.g., Gboard Double Sided, Bar, Mageru, CAPS, Furikku, Yunomi, PiroPiro).
    - The user must flash the corresponding firmware onto the microcontroller of the keyboard.
    - An attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the keyboard that exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability. This could be achieved through:
        - USB interface by sending malicious HID reports.
        - Bluetooth interface by sending specially crafted Bluetooth packets or commands (if the keyboard uses Bluetooth).
        - Potentially through manipulation of sensor inputs if the firmware processes sensor data in a vulnerable way.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The firmware source code files in C/C++ are not included in the provided PROJECT FILES, making a detailed source code analysis to pinpoint specific vulnerable code locations impossible.
    - However, based on the nature of embedded firmware development in C/C++ and common vulnerability patterns, potential areas where buffer overflows could exist include:
        - USB HID report parsing routines in the firmware, especially when handling variable-length data fields like strings.
        - Bluetooth communication handling code, if Bluetooth is used for keyboard input or configuration.
        - Sensor data processing, particularly if sensor readings are converted to strings or processed in buffers without sufficient size checks.
        - Any code sections that involve string manipulation (e.g., formatting, copying) or data copying into fixed-size buffers.
- Security Test Case:
    - **Objective:** To attempt to trigger a buffer overflow in the keyboard firmware by sending oversized input data via the USB HID interface.
    - **Precondition:** A Gboard-based keyboard is built and flashed with the firmware, and connected to a host computer via USB.
    - **Steps:**
        1. Identify the USB HID report structure that the keyboard firmware expects for key input. (This might require reverse engineering the firmware if documentation is insufficient).
        2. Craft a malicious USB HID report that contains an excessively long string or data field in a parameter that is likely to be copied into a buffer in the firmware.
        3. Use a USB packet crafting tool (e.g., using Python's `usb.core` library or similar tools) to send the crafted HID report to the keyboard.
        4. Monitor the keyboard's behavior and the host system for signs of a crash, reset, or unexpected behavior after sending the malicious report.
        5. Attempt to observe if arbitrary code execution can be achieved. This may require more advanced debugging techniques for the specific microcontroller platform. For instance, check if you can inject commands or keystrokes beyond what is normally possible.
    - **Expected Result:** If a buffer overflow vulnerability exists, sending the crafted HID report might cause the keyboard to malfunction, crash, or exhibit other abnormal behavior. In a successful exploit scenario, it might be possible to demonstrate arbitrary code execution.
    - **Note:** This is a general test case. The specific details of crafting the malicious input would depend on the firmware implementation and the specific input handling routines used in each keyboard project. Further reverse engineering of the firmware would be necessary for precise testing.
