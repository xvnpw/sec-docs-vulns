- Vulnerability Name: Lack of Firmware Signing and Verification
- Description: The firmware update process for these DIY keyboards does not implement any cryptographic signing or verification. This allows an attacker to create and distribute a malicious firmware image that, when flashed onto a physical keyboard, can compromise the connected computer. The user is given no mechanism to verify the authenticity or integrity of the firmware before flashing. An attacker could distribute this malicious firmware through various channels, tricking users into installing it as a legitimate update.
- Impact: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain complete control over a victim's computer via HID attacks. By injecting arbitrary keystrokes, the attacker can execute commands, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions without the user's knowledge or consent. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The provided documentation and project files do not describe any firmware signing or verification mechanisms. The firmware flashing process, as described, is inherently insecure as it trusts any firmware image presented to it.
- Missing Mitigations: Implementation of a secure firmware update process that includes:
    - Firmware signing using a private key.
    - Firmware verification on the device using a corresponding public key before flashing.
    - Secure boot mechanisms to ensure only verified firmware can execute.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must create a malicious firmware image compatible with the target DIY keyboard hardware.
    - The attacker needs to distribute this malicious firmware to potential victims, for example, by hosting it on a website, sharing it through forums, or other channels where users might seek firmware updates.
    - The user must be convinced to download and flash the malicious firmware onto their keyboard, believing it to be a legitimate update or unaware of the risks.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Analysis of the provided project files, specifically the README files for projects like `mozc-doublesided`, `mozc-bar`, `mozc-mageru`, `mozc-caps`, `mozc-yunomi`, `mozc-piropiro`, and `mozc-furikku`, reveals no mention of any firmware signing or verification process.
    - The `mozc-doublesided/README.md` describes using STM32CubeProgrammer to flash a prebuilt firmware file (`firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf`) onto the microcontroller. This process relies solely on the user trusting the source of the firmware file and the channel through which it is distributed. There is no cryptographic check to ensure the firmware's integrity or origin.
    - Similarly, for Arduino-based projects (e.g., `mozc-bar`, `mozc-caps`), the instructions involve using the Arduino IDE to upload firmware. The Arduino IDE, in its standard configuration for DIY projects, does not enforce firmware signing or verification, making these projects equally vulnerable.
    - The absence of any security-related code or configuration in the provided files related to firmware updates further confirms the lack of implemented mitigations.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation (Attacker):**
        - Choose a target keyboard project (e.g., `mozc-doublesided`).
        - Obtain the development environment and tools necessary to build firmware for the target keyboard (e.g., STM32CubeIDE for `mozc-doublesided` or Arduino IDE for Arduino projects).
        - Modify the firmware source code to include malicious payload. For example, inject code to simulate pressing `CTRL+ALT+T` (to open a terminal on Linux), then type `whoami` followed by `ENTER`. Compile this modified firmware.
        - Host the malicious firmware (e.g., the `.elf` file for `mozc-doublesided` or the compiled binary for Arduino projects) on a publicly accessible website or a file-sharing platform. Create a plausible narrative to trick users into downloading it, such as "Firmware Update for improved performance" or "Bug fix release".
    2. **Action (User):**
        - The user, intending to update their DIY keyboard firmware, discovers the attacker's hosted malicious firmware.
        - The user downloads the malicious firmware file.
        - Following the project's instructions (e.g., `mozc-doublesided/README.md` or Arduino project README), the user uses the appropriate flashing tool (STM32CubeProgrammer or Arduino IDE) to flash the downloaded malicious firmware onto their DIY keyboard.
    3. **Verification (User):**
        - After flashing is complete, the user connects the keyboard to their computer via USB.
        - The malicious firmware executes upon keyboard initialization.
        - **Expected Result:** A terminal window automatically opens on the user's computer, and the command `whoami` is executed, with the output displayed in the terminal. This demonstrates successful arbitrary command execution due to the malicious firmware injecting keystrokes.
    4. **Pass/Fail:** If the terminal window opens and the `whoami` command is executed, the test **passes**, confirming the "Lack of Firmware Signing and Verification" vulnerability. If the malicious actions do not occur, the test **fails** (which is highly unlikely given the absence of firmware security measures in the project).
