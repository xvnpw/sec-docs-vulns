## Combined Vulnerability List

Below is a combined list of identified vulnerabilities, with duplicates removed and formatted as requested.

### Potential Buffer Overflow in Firmware Input Handling

- **Description:**
    - The firmware, designed for various keyboard projects and likely written in C/C++, handles input from key presses, sensors, and communication interfaces (USB, Bluetooth).
    - A buffer overflow can occur if the firmware doesn't properly validate the size and format of input data before processing.
    - Specifically, if input data is copied into fixed-size buffers without length checks, an attacker can send crafted input exceeding the buffer's capacity.
    - This can overwrite adjacent memory, corrupting program data or control flow.
    - For example, sending an overly long string via USB HID reports for key input, without bounds checking, could trigger a buffer overflow.

- **Impact:**
    - Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the microcontroller.
    - An attacker can gain control of the keyboard's functionality, potentially:
        - Injecting arbitrary keystrokes into the connected host system.
        - Modifying the keyboard's behavior for malicious purposes.
        - Using the keyboard to launch further attacks on the host system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No explicit buffer overflow mitigations are mentioned in the project documentation.
    - Standard C/C++ practices *might* be assumed, but their effectiveness is unverified without source code examination.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement checks to ensure input data conforms to size and format limits before processing.
    - **Bounds Checking:** Use bounds checking when copying input data to prevent writing beyond buffer boundaries.
    - **Safe String Handling Functions:** Utilize functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf` instead of `strcpy` or `sprintf` to prevent overflows.
    - **Memory Protection:** If the microcontroller supports MPUs, use them to isolate memory regions and limit overflow impact.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User builds a physical keyboard based on project designs (e.g., Gboard Double Sided, Bar, etc.).
    - User flashes the firmware onto the keyboard's microcontroller.
    - Attacker can send crafted input to exploit the buffer overflow via:
        - USB interface with malicious HID reports.
        - Bluetooth interface with crafted packets (if applicable).
        - Potentially sensor input manipulation.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Firmware source code is not provided, preventing precise analysis.
    - Potential vulnerable areas include:
        - USB HID report parsing, especially variable-length data like strings.
        - Bluetooth communication handling (if used).
        - Sensor data processing, especially string conversions or buffering.
        - Any string manipulation or data copying into fixed-size buffers.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Objective:** Trigger a buffer overflow by sending oversized input via USB HID.
    - **Precondition:** Gboard-based keyboard built, flashed, and connected via USB.
    - **Steps:**
        1. Identify expected USB HID report structure for key input (may require reverse engineering).
        2. Craft a malicious HID report with an excessively long string in a likely buffer.
        3. Use a USB packet crafting tool to send the report to the keyboard.
        4. Monitor keyboard and host for crashes, resets, or unexpected behavior.
        5. Attempt to observe arbitrary code execution (requires advanced debugging).
    - **Expected Result:** Malfunction, crash, or abnormal behavior of the keyboard. Successful exploit may lead to arbitrary code execution.
    - **Note:** Specific malicious input crafting depends on firmware implementation and input handling. Reverse engineering is needed for precise testing.

### Unsigned Firmware Flashing

- **Description:**
    - The project lacks firmware integrity or authenticity verification mechanisms during the flashing process.
    - An attacker can create malicious firmware and trick users into flashing it.
    - Distribution channels for malicious firmware include compromised repositories, fake guides, or social engineering.

- **Impact:**
    - Flashing malicious firmware grants the attacker complete control over the keyboard.
    - This enables keystroke injection attacks, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary keystrokes to the user's computer without consent.
    - Consequences include data theft, arbitrary command execution, and malware installation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. No firmware signing or verification mechanisms are implemented.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement firmware signing and verification.
    - Firmware flashing should include signature verification before flashing.
    - Enable secure boot mechanisms on the microcontroller if available.
    - Warn users about the risks of flashing firmware from untrusted sources in documentation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker creates a malicious firmware image.
    - Attacker convinces a user to download and flash the malicious firmware.
    - User follows project's flashing instructions (e.g., using STM32CubeProgrammer).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `mozc-doublesided/README.md` instructs on firmware flashing.
    2. "Firmware upload" guides users to use STM32CubeProgrammer to flash `firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf`.
    3. No steps for verifying firmware authenticity or integrity are mentioned.
    4. Firmware is provided as a pre-built binary (`.elf`) for direct flashing without checks.
    5. No code in provided files implements firmware signing or verification.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare malicious firmware:** Modify firmware source code to include keystroke injection (e.g., send "evil command"). Compile to malicious `mozc.elf`.
    2. **Create fake guide/distribute malicious firmware:** Host malicious `mozc.elf` in a fake guide or repository, or share directly via social engineering.
    3. **Instruct user to flash malicious firmware:** Guide user to original flashing instructions but point to the malicious `mozc.elf`.
    4. **Test keystroke injection:** After flashing and connecting, check if injected keystrokes are sent (e.g., "evil command" appears in a text editor).

### Use of Pre-built Firmware Binaries

- **Description:**
    - The "Gboard double sided version" build instructions recommend flashing a pre-built firmware binary (`firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf`).
    - Users are forced to use this pre-compiled binary from a potentially untrusted source, without instructions to build from source.
    - A malicious actor could replace this binary with a compromised version containing malware.
    - Users following official instructions unknowingly flash this potentially malicious binary.

- **Impact:**
    - High. Malicious firmware can compromise keystrokes and sensitive data.
    - Attackers can access passwords, messages, financial information, etc.
    - Backdoors in firmware could grant further system control.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `mozc-doublesided` provides pre-built firmware without integrity checks or build alternatives.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Provide instructions and scripts to build firmware from source.
    - Implement checksums or digital signatures for pre-built binaries for verification.
    - Host firmware source code in the repository for transparency and independent building.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User builds "Gboard double sided version" keyboard.
    - User follows official build instructions in `README.md`.
    - User proceeds to "Firmware upload" and flashes `firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/mozc-doublesided/README.md` "Firmware upload" section instructs users to flash `firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf`.
    - Instructions directly lead users to flash a pre-compiled binary without source code compilation alternatives or security verification.
    - No source code for generating `firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf` is explicitly provided in `mozc-doublesided`. `firmware/` directory contains STM32CubeIDE project files, suggesting source code exists but isn't directly presented for user building.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Controlled test environment (VM or isolated system). Clean project repository copy.
    2. **Attack Scenario:** Replace legitimate `code/mozc-doublesided/firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf` with a malicious ELF binary (e.g., keylogger).
    3. **User Action:** Follow `/code/mozc-doublesided/README.md` instructions to flash the malicious `firmware/prebuilt/mozc.elf` onto a test microcontroller. Simulate keyboard usage.
    4. **Verification:** Check if keylogging functionality executes (keystrokes logged in memory, sent to network, etc.).
    5. **Expected Result:** Malicious firmware executes keylogging, confirming vulnerability of using pre-built binaries.
