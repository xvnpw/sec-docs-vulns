### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Fuzzy Matching Bypass via Crafted Input
- Description:
  - An attacker can craft subtly altered malicious strings that are highly similar to legitimate or blacklisted strings.
  - This allows them to bypass input validation or security filters in web applications that use UniSim for fuzzy matching.
  - Step 1: Identify a web application or system that uses UniSim's `TextSim` for fuzzy matching as part of its input validation or security filtering mechanism.
  - Step 2: Determine the blacklist of words or patterns the application is trying to filter.
  - Step 3: Craft subtly altered versions of blacklisted strings using techniques such as:
    - Homoglyphs (replacing characters with visually similar characters, e.g., 'l' with '1', 'o' with '0').
    - Slight misspellings (adding, removing, or swapping characters).
    - Adding extra spaces or punctuation.
    - Appending or prepending characters.
  - Step 4: Input the crafted strings into the application.
  - Step 5: If the application relies solely on UniSim's fuzzy matching with a similarity threshold to block inputs, the crafted strings, despite being similar to blacklisted strings, might be considered dissimilar enough to bypass the filter. This is because fuzzy matching is designed for similarity, not strict security enforcement.
- Impact:
  - Successful bypass of input validation or security filters can lead to various security issues depending on the context of the application.
  - If used in access control, it could lead to unauthorized access.
  - If used in data sanitization, it could allow malicious content to be processed or stored.
  - In applications like phishing domain detection, it could lead to failing to detect phishing attempts by subtly altering domain names.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium (can be High depending on the application context)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the UniSim library itself.
  - UniSim is designed for similarity computations and does not include built-in input validation or security features.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization should be implemented *before* using UniSim for fuzzy matching in security-sensitive contexts.
  - Application developers should be aware of the inherent limitations of fuzzy matching for security and not rely on it as the sole security measure.
  - Missing mitigations include:
    - Implementing strict input validation and sanitization to normalize inputs before fuzzy matching.
    - Using whitelists instead of blacklists where possible.
    - Combining fuzzy matching with other security measures, such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and behavioral analysis.
    - Carefully tuning the similarity threshold and potentially using more strict thresholds for security-critical applications.
    - Educating developers about the risks of fuzzy matching bypass in security contexts.
- Preconditions:
  - A web application or system uses UniSim's `TextSim` for fuzzy matching as part of its input validation or security filtering mechanism.
  - The application relies on a blacklist or a similarity threshold based on UniSim to identify and block potentially malicious or unwanted inputs.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - Step 1: Review the `unisim/textsim.py` and `unisim/unisim.py` files.
  - Step 2: Observe that the `TextSim.similarity()` and `TextSim.match()` functions in `unisim/textsim.py` (and the underlying `UniSim` class in `unisim/unisim.py`) are designed to calculate similarity scores between text inputs based on embeddings.
  - Step 3: Notice the absence of any input sanitization or validation logic within these functions or the broader UniSim library. The focus is solely on embedding generation and similarity calculation.
  - Step 4: Understand that the RETSim model and USearch index, used by UniSim, are built for efficient similarity search, not for enforcing security policies or preventing bypasses. They are designed to find similar strings, even with subtle variations.
  - Step 5: Consider an example: `text_sim = TextSim(); similarity_score = text_sim.similarity("blacklistword", "blacklist word")`. This code snippet demonstrates how UniSim will likely return a high similarity score (close to 1.0) for these two strings, even though they are not identical. If an application uses a simple similarity threshold to block "blacklistword", a user might bypass it by inputting "blacklist word".  The same applies to homoglyphs and other subtle alterations.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Set up a Python script that simulates a security filter using UniSim's `TextSim`.
  - Step 2: Initialize `TextSim`: `text_sim = TextSim()`.
  - Step 3: Define a blacklist word: `blacklist_word = "password"`.
  - Step 4: Implement a filter function:
    ```python
    def is_input_blocked(user_input, blacklist_word, threshold=0.9):
        similarity = text_sim.similarity(user_input, blacklist_word)
        return similarity > threshold
    ```
  - Step 5: Test with a legitimate input: `legitimate_input = "username"`. `is_input_blocked(legitimate_input, blacklist_word)` should return `False`.
  - Step 6: Test with the blacklist word: `blocked_input = "password"`. `is_input_blocked(blocked_input, blacklist_word)` should return `True`.
  - Step 7: Test with a crafted input using a homoglyph: `bypass_input_homoglyph = "passwOrd"`. Test `is_input_blocked(bypass_input_homoglyph, blacklist_word)` and observe if it returns `False` (bypass) or `True` (blocked).
  - Step 8: Test with a crafted input using a space: `bypass_input_space = "pass word"`. Test `is_input_blocked(bypass_input_space, blacklist_word)` and observe the result.
  - Step 9: Test with a crafted input using extra characters: `bypass_input_extra_chars = "passworddd"`. Test `is_input_blocked(bypass_input_extra_chars, blacklist_word)` and observe the result.
  - Step 10: Vary the `threshold` value (e.g., 0.95, 0.8) and repeat steps 7-9 to see how the threshold affects the bypass.  A lower threshold may block more inputs, but also increase false positives. A higher threshold may be easier to bypass.
  - Step 11: Analyze the results: If the crafted inputs (homoglyph, space, extra characters) bypass the filter (i.e., `is_input_blocked` returns `False` for these inputs), it confirms the fuzzy matching bypass vulnerability. The test demonstrates that relying solely on UniSim's fuzzy matching with a similarity threshold is insufficient for robust security filtering against crafted inputs.
