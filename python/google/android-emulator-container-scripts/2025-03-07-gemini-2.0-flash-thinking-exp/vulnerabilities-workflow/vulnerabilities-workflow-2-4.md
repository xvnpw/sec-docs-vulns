### Vulnerability Name: Unprotected ADB Port Exposure

- Description:
  1. The `run.sh` and `run-with-gpu.sh` scripts, used to launch the Docker container, expose port 5555 of the container to the host using the `--publish 5555:5555/tcp` option.
  2. This port is the standard ADB port for Android devices.
  3. The Dockerfile also EXPOSEs port 5555, further indicating the intention to make it accessible.
  4. The README.md explicitly mentions that port 5555 is forwarded for ADB access and provides instructions on how to connect to the emulator via `adb connect localhost:5555`.
  5. There is no authentication or access control implemented in the provided scripts or Dockerfile to protect the exposed ADB port.
  6. An attacker on the same network or from the internet (if the host is publicly accessible and firewall rules allow) can connect to the exposed port 5555 on the host machine.
  7. Once connected, the attacker gains unauthorized ADB access to the Android emulator running inside the Docker container.
  8. With ADB access, the attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands within the emulator, install/uninstall applications, access files, and potentially extract sensitive data or perform malicious actions within the emulated Android environment.

- Impact:
  - Unauthorized access to the Android emulator.
  - Full control over the emulated Android device via ADB shell.
  - Potential data breach by accessing sensitive information within the emulator's environment.
  - Installation of malicious applications or execution of arbitrary code within the emulator.
  - Manipulation of the emulated environment for malicious purposes.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The project explicitly exposes the ADB port without any implemented access control.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Authentication for ADB Access**: Implement authentication mechanisms for ADB connections to the container. This could involve using ADB keys and ensuring only authorized keys can connect, or using network-based access control lists.
  - **Network Segmentation**: Isolate the Docker container network from public networks to reduce the attack surface.
  - **Firewall Rules**: Implement firewall rules on the host machine to restrict access to port 5555 to only trusted networks or IP addresses.
  - **Disable ADB Port Exposure by Default**: The ADB port should not be exposed by default. It should be an opt-in configuration with clear warnings about the security implications.
  - **Documentation and Warnings**: Clearly document the security risks of exposing the ADB port and provide guidance on mitigation strategies like firewall configuration and disabling port exposure if not needed.

- Preconditions:
  - A Docker container is running using the provided scripts (`run.sh` or `run-with-gpu.sh`).
  - The containerized emulator instance is accessible on the network (either locally or publicly depending on network configuration).
  - The host machine's firewall (if any) allows incoming connections to port 5555.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **`/code/run.sh` and `/code/run-with-gpu.sh`**:
    ```sh
    docker run \
      --device /dev/kvm \
      --publish 8554:8554/tcp \
      --publish 5555:5555/tcp <docker-image-id>
    ```
    These scripts directly use `--publish 5555:5555/tcp` which maps the container's port 5555 to the host's port 5555, making it externally accessible. There is no indication of any authentication mechanism being set up for this port in these scripts.

  - **`/code/emu/templates/Dockerfile`**:
    ```dockerfile
    # This is the ADB port, useful.
    EXPOSE 5555
    ```
    The Dockerfile itself explicitly EXPOSEs port 5555, confirming the intention to make it available.

  - **`/code/README.md`**:
    ```markdown
    ## adb

    We forward the port 5555 for adb access to the emulator running inside the
    container. Adb might not automatically detect the device, so run:

        adb connect localhost:5555
    ```
    The README documentation confirms that port 5555 is intended for ADB access and provides instructions to connect using `adb connect localhost:5555`, further highlighting the lack of default protection.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Deploy the Android Emulator Container project on a publicly accessible server (e.g., cloud instance) using `run.sh` script. Ensure port 5555 is open in the firewall.
     - Obtain the public IP address of the server.
  2. **Attacker Action**:
     - From an attacker machine (could be any machine with internet access and ADB installed), use the ADB command to connect to the exposed port of the deployed instance:
       ```sh
       adb connect <public_ip_of_server>:5555
       ```
     - Once connected, attempt to execute ADB shell commands to verify unauthorized access. For example:
       ```sh
       adb -s <public_ip_of_server>:5555 shell getprop ro.product.model
       ```
       This command should return the model of the Android emulator, confirming successful unauthorized ADB access.
  3. **Expected Result**:
     - The `adb connect` command should succeed, indicating a successful connection to the ADB port.
     - The `adb shell getprop ro.product.model` command should execute successfully and return the device model information, demonstrating unauthorized command execution on the emulator.
  4. **Pass/Fail**:
     - If the attacker can successfully connect to the ADB port and execute commands without any authentication, the test case **passes**, confirming the vulnerability.
     - If the attacker is unable to connect or execute commands due to implemented mitigations (which are currently absent in the provided code), the test case **fails**.
