### Vulnerability 1: Insufficient Firebase Authentication Enforcement

* Description:
    1. An attacker identifies that the web interface for the Android Emulator uses Firebase for authentication, as indicated in the project documentation and Envoy configuration (`js/docker/envoy.yaml`, `js/develop/envoy.yaml`).
    2. The attacker inspects the Envoy configuration and observes that JWT authentication is enforced for paths starting with `/android.emulation.control` and `/android.emulation.control.Rtc`.
    3. However, the attacker discovers that the Nginx web server, which serves the React application, and the React application itself, do not independently verify Firebase authentication.
    4. The attacker directly accesses the Nginx web server (e.g., by bypassing the Envoy proxy if it is not directly exposed or by crafting requests that do not go through Envoy for initial access to the web application) or modifies the client-side React application to remove or bypass any client-side authentication checks.
    5. The attacker then interacts with the emulator through the web interface served by Nginx, potentially sending gRPC requests directly to the emulator's gRPC endpoint (port 8554) without proper Firebase authentication enforced at the application level.
    6. If the emulator's gRPC endpoint is reachable without going through Envoy, or if the React app can bypass client-side checks and still communicate with the backend services directly (or modified to send requests directly to port 8554), the attacker could potentially control the emulator without valid Firebase credentials.

* Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Android Emulator instance, potentially controlling the emulator and accessing any data or functionalities exposed through the gRPC interface.
    - Data Breach: If sensitive data is accessible via the emulator or actions performed on the emulator can lead to data exposure, a data breach could occur.
    - Malicious Operations: Attackers could use the compromised emulator instance for malicious activities, such as running unauthorized tests, manipulating emulator state for fraudulent purposes, or using it as a jump point for further attacks.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Firebase Authentication via Envoy Proxy: The project uses Envoy proxy to enforce JWT-based Firebase authentication for gRPC requests targeting `/android.emulation.control` and `/android.emulation.control.Rtc` paths. This mitigation is implemented in `js/docker/envoy.yaml` and `js/develop/envoy.yaml`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Application-Level Authentication: Missing is a robust authentication mechanism within the Nginx served React application and potentially within the emulator's gRPC service itself to verify Firebase authentication tokens independently of the Envoy proxy.
    - Backend gRPC Endpoint Protection: Ensure that the emulator's gRPC endpoint (port 8554) is not directly accessible from the public internet, and all requests should ideally be routed and authenticated via the Envoy proxy.

* Preconditions:
    - Publicly Accessible Emulator Web Interface: The Android Emulator web interface, including the Nginx server and potentially the gRPC endpoint (port 8554), must be accessible over the internet or an untrusted network.
    - Misconfiguration or Bypass of Envoy Proxy: The attacker needs to bypass or circumvent the Firebase authentication enforced by the Envoy proxy, either by directly accessing Nginx or crafting requests that bypass the proxyâ€™s filtering.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`js/docker/envoy.yaml` & `js/develop/envoy.yaml`**: These files configure Envoy proxy to handle authentication. The `jwt_authn` filter is set up, which is a positive security measure.

    ```yaml
    http_filters:
    - name: envoy.filters.http.cors
      typed_config:
        "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.cors.v3.Cors
    - name: envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn
      typed_config:
        "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtAuthentication
        providers:
          firebase_jwt:
            issuer: https://securetoken.google.com/android-emulator-webrtc-demo
            audiences:
            - android-emulator-webrtc-demo
            remote_jwks:
              http_uri:
                uri: https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com
                cluster: jwks_cluster
                timeout: 60s
              cache_duration:
                seconds: 300
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: "/android.emulation.control"
          requires:
            provider_name: "firebase_jwt"
        - match:
            prefix: "/android.emulation.control.Rtc"
          requires:
            provider_name: "firebase_jwt"
    ```

    - **`js/docker/docker-compose.yaml` & `js/docker/development.yaml`**: These files define the Docker Compose setup. They show that Nginx and Envoy are separate services. Nginx is exposed on ports 80 and 443, while Envoy proxies requests based on configured routes. The separation and exposure of Nginx directly on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports might allow direct access to the React app without JWT verification if not correctly configured.

    - **`js/` directory (React App Code)**: Examination of the Javascript code in `js/src` would be needed to confirm if client-side authentication is implemented and how robust it is. If client-side authentication is the *only* layer of authentication besides Envoy, it's easily bypassable. If the React app directly communicates with the gRPC backend without proper token handling after initial Envoy authentication, it introduces a vulnerability.  *(Note: Detailed React code analysis is not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming potential weakness based on architectural design)*

* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup a publicly accessible instance of the Android Emulator web interface using the provided docker-compose files (js/docker/docker-compose.yaml).
    2. Identify the public IP address or hostname of the deployed web interface.
    3. Attempt to access the web interface directly through a browser using the public IP address or hostname (e.g., `http://<public-ip>` or `https://<public-hostname>`).
    4. Observe that the React application loads, presenting a login interface (as intended with Firebase Auth).
    5. Using browser developer tools or a network interception proxy (like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP), examine the network requests made by the React application when interacting with the emulator controls.
    6. Identify the gRPC endpoints being called (likely on port 8554, as configured in `run.sh` and Envoy config).
    7. Attempt to craft a direct gRPC request to the emulator's gRPC endpoint (port 8554) without including a valid Firebase JWT token in the headers. This can be done using tools like `grpcurl` or by writing a simple gRPC client.
    8. If successful in sending gRPC requests and receiving responses from the emulator without Firebase authentication, it confirms that the gRPC endpoint is not sufficiently protected beyond the Envoy proxy and that direct access (or bypassed proxy access) is possible.
    9. Further, attempt to interact with the web interface served by Nginx directly, bypassing Envoy completely if possible (e.g., if Envoy is only configured for HTTPS on port 443, try accessing HTTP on port 80 or directly accessing Nginx's internal Docker network port if feasible in a test environment).
    10. If you can interact with the web application and subsequently control the emulator without proper Firebase authentication, this confirms the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker might bypass Firebase authentication by directly interacting with components of the web interface or the gRPC service, highlighting the insufficient enforcement of authentication beyond the edge proxy layer.
