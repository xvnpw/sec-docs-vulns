- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `extra` parameter in OTA generation

- Description:
    - The application allows users to specify extra parameters for the `ota_from_target_files` command through the `extra` field in the JSON payload sent to the `/run` endpoint.
    - The `ProcessesManagement.ota_generate` function in `ota_interface.py` takes the `extra` string, splits it by spaces, and directly appends the resulting list of strings as arguments to the `ota_from_target_files` command.
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by including malicious characters like semicolons, backticks, or pipes within the `extra` parameter.
    - For example, an attacker could set `extra` to `; touch /tmp/pwned` to execute the `touch` command on the server.

- Impact:
    - **High**. Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the web application.
    - This can lead to:
        - **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive data stored on the server.
        - **System Compromise:** Complete control over the server, including installing malware, creating backdoors, or further attacking internal networks.
        - **Denial of Service (Indirect):** While not a direct DoS vulnerability, an attacker could execute commands that crash the server or consume excessive resources.

- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly processes the `extra` parameter without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The application should sanitize the `extra` input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters and command separators.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the `extra` input against an allowlist of expected parameters or patterns. Ideally, the application should parse the expected extra parameters and pass them to `ota_from_target_files` in a safe manner, instead of directly passing a user-provided string.
    - **Using `subprocess.Popen` Safely:**  While `subprocess.Popen` is used with `shell=False`, the way arguments are constructed and passed is still vulnerable because user input is directly incorporated into the command list without proper escaping or validation.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have network access to the web application's `/run` endpoint.
    - The web application must be running and accessible.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/ota_interface.py`
    - Function: `ProcessesManagement.ota_generate(self, args, id)`
    ```python
    def ota_generate(self, args, id):
        """
        ...
        """
        command = ['ota_from_target_files']
        # ... other arguments ...
        if args['extra_keys']:
            args['extra'] = '--' + \
                ' --'.join(args['extra_keys']) + ' ' + args['extra'] # Line 202
        if args['extra']:
            command += args['extra'].strip().split(' ') # Line 204
        # ... rest of the command construction and execution ...
    ```
    - **Line 202**: This line constructs the `extra` string by combining `extra_keys` and `extra` values. While `extra_keys` might be controlled by the application logic to some extent, the `args['extra']` value is directly taken from the user-provided JSON payload.
    - **Line 204**:  This line is the core of the vulnerability. `args['extra']` which is user-controlled, is split by spaces using `.strip().split(' ')` and the resulting list is directly appended to the `command` list.
    - **Example:** If `args['extra']` is set to `"--disable_vabc ; touch /tmp/pwned"`, the `command` list will become something like:
    ```
    ['ota_from_target_files', ..., '--disable_vabc', ';', 'touch', '/tmp/pwned', ..., 'target_file', 'output_file']
    ```
    - When `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=False, ...)` is executed, even with `shell=False`, the semicolon `;` acts as a command separator in most shells. This allows the attacker to inject and execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command after `ota_from_target_files` command, or even before depending on the shell and argument parsing.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Step 1:** Prepare a target file (can be a dummy zip file). Upload it via the web interface and note its path in the 'target' directory.
    - **Step 2:** Send a POST request to the `/run/<job_id>` endpoint (e.g., `/run/test_command_injection`) with the following JSON payload:
    ```json
    {
        "target": "/app/target/<your_uploaded_target_file>.zip",
        "isIncremental": false,
        "isPartial": false,
        "verbose": false,
        "extra": "; touch /tmp/pwned_ota_generator"
    }
    ```
    - Replace `<your_uploaded_target_file>.zip` with the actual filename of the uploaded target file.
    - **Step 3:** After sending the request, access the server's shell (e.g., via `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash` if running in Docker).
    - **Step 4:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_ota_generator` exists.
    - **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned_ota_generator` will be created, indicating successful command injection.
