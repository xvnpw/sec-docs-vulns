### Vulnerabilities Found

#### Command Injection via `extra` parameter

- Description:
    1. An attacker can send a POST request to the `/run/<job_id>` endpoint.
    2. The request body should be in JSON format.
    3. The JSON payload can include an `extra` parameter, which is intended to pass extra arguments to the `ota_from_target_files` command.
    4. The backend code in `ota_interface.py` at `ProcessesManagement.ota_generate` takes the value of the `extra` parameter from the JSON payload.
    5. This `extra` string is then split by spaces using `.strip().split(' ')`.
    6. The resulting list of strings is directly appended to the command list that will be executed using `subprocess.Popen`.
    7. By crafting a malicious string in the `extra` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands. For example, injecting `; touch /tmp/pwned ;` within the `extra` parameter will result in the execution of `touch /tmp/pwned` command on the server, in addition to the intended `ota_from_target_files` command.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web application.
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, denial of service, and further propagation into internal networks.
    - In the context of this application, an attacker could potentially:
        - Steal uploaded target files or generated OTA packages.
        - Modify or delete target files or generated OTA packages.
        - Install malware or backdoors on the server.
        - Use the server as a stepping stone to attack other systems.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly processes the `extra` parameter without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation**: Sanitize and validate the `extra` parameter to ensure it only contains expected arguments for `ota_from_target_files` and does not include any shell metacharacters or command separators. A whitelist approach is recommended to define allowed arguments and their formats.
    - **Command Construction using Safe Methods**: Avoid splitting the `extra` string based on spaces and directly appending to the command list. If passing extra arguments is required, use safer methods for command construction, such as using a dedicated library for argument parsing or carefully constructing the command list in a way that prevents injection. Parameterized commands or shell argument escaping should be considered.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure the web application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the impact of command injection, but it does not prevent the vulnerability itself.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have network access to the web application's `/run` endpoint.
    - The web application must be running and accessible.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/ota_interface.py`
    - Function: `ProcessesManagement.ota_generate`
    ```python
    def ota_generate(self, args, id):
        command = ['ota_from_target_files']
        # ...
        if args['extra_keys']: # This seems irrelevant to command injection, and might be a red herring
            args['extra'] = '--' + \
                ' --'.join(args['extra_keys']) + ' ' + args['extra']
        if args['extra']:
            command += args['extra'].strip().split(' ') # Vulnerable line
        # ...
        self.ota_run(command, id, job_info.stdout, job_info.stderr)
    ```
    - **Step-by-step analysis:**
        1. The `ota_generate` function in `ota_interface.py` is called by `web_server.py` when a POST request is made to the `/run/<id>` endpoint. The `args` parameter is populated from the JSON request body.
        2. The code checks if `args['extra']` exists. If it does, it proceeds to process it.
        3. The line `command += args['extra'].strip().split(' ')` splits the `args['extra']` string by spaces and appends each part as a separate argument to the `command` list.
        4. This is vulnerable because if an attacker provides a malicious string in `args['extra']` containing shell commands, these commands will be interpreted as arguments to `ota_from_target_files` and potentially executed by the shell or by `ota_from_target_files` if it improperly handles arguments. While `subprocess.Popen` is used with a list of arguments which reduces the risk of shell injection compared to `shell=True`, it doesn't prevent parameter injection or misuse of arguments by the underlying command being executed. In this case, injecting commands via `;` or `&&` in `extra` can lead to command execution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites**:
        - Deploy the `ota-generator` web application to a test environment.
        - Ensure the application is accessible over HTTP (e.g., on `http://localhost:8000`).
    2. **Steps**:
        - Open a tool to send HTTP requests (like `curl`, `Postman`, or a web browser's developer console).
        - Send a POST request to the `/run/test_job_id` endpoint (replace `test_job_id` with any ID).
        - Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
        - Set the request body to the following JSON payload:
        ```json
        {
          "target": "/app/target/target_files.zip",
          "incremental": "/app/target/incremental_files.zip",
          "extra": "--test_arg ; touch /tmp/pwned ;"
        }
        ```
        - **Note**: You may need to upload dummy `target_files.zip` and `incremental_files.zip` to the `/file` endpoint first, or adjust the paths in the JSON payload to valid file paths accessible to the application. For a simple test, creating empty files in the `target` directory within the docker container should suffice.
        - Send the request.
    3. **Verification**:
        - Access the server's shell (e.g., using `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` if running in Docker).
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the server.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, and the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was executed.

#### Path Traversal in File Upload

- Description:
    1. An attacker sends a POST request to the `/file/<filename>` endpoint, where `<filename>` is maliciously crafted to include path traversal sequences like `../../`.
    2. The backend server, implemented in `web_server.py`, extracts the filename directly from the URL path without proper validation using `self.path[6:]`.
    3. The server then uses `os.path.join('target', self.path[6:])` to construct the file path. Due to the lack of sanitization, the path traversal sequences in the filename are preserved, allowing the constructed path to escape the intended 'target' directory.
    4. The server proceeds to open and write the content of the uploaded file to this potentially manipulated path. This enables an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem, outside the designated 'target' directory.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**. An attacker can write arbitrary files to the server's filesystem. This can lead to:
        - Overwriting critical system files, potentially causing system instability or denial of service.
        - Uploading malicious executable files or scripts, which could be executed by the server or other users, leading to remote code execution.
        - Modifying application configuration files to alter the application's behavior or gain unauthorized access.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in `web_server.py`.
    - `web_server_flask.py` uses a temporary file and the `TargetLib.new_build` function, which renames the file to a standardized name and location, thus mitigating this specific path traversal vulnerability. However, `web_server.py` remains vulnerable.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The filename provided in the URL path (`self.path[6:]` in `web_server.py`) should be rigorously validated and sanitized.
    - **Path Traversal Prevention**: Implement checks to ensure that the constructed file path remains within the intended 'target' directory. Use secure path manipulation functions that prevent traversal outside of allowed paths.
    - **Filename Restrictions**: Restrict allowed characters in filenames to a safe subset and reject filenames containing path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths.

- Preconditions:
    - The `web_server.py` server must be running and accessible over the network.
    - An attacker must be able to send POST requests to the `/file/<filename>` endpoint.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/web_server.py`
    - Function: `RequestHandler.do_POST`
    - Vulnerable Code Snippet:
      ```python
      elif self.path.startswith('/file'):
          file_name = os.path.join('target', self.path[6:])
          file_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])
          with open(file_name, 'wb') as output_file:
              # ... file writing operations ...
      ```
    - Analysis:
        - `self.path` contains the URL path requested by the client, including the filename part after `/file/`.
        - `self.path[6:]` extracts the filename directly from the URL, starting from the 7th character (index 6). This extracted filename is used without any sanitization or validation.
        - `os.path.join('target', self.path[6:])` constructs the file path by joining the 'target' directory with the user-provided filename. If the filename contains path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../evil.txt`), `os.path.join` will resolve them, leading to a path outside the 'target' directory (e.g., `/evil.txt`).
        - `open(file_name, 'wb')` opens the file at the potentially traversed path in write binary mode (`wb`). This allows the attacker to write arbitrary content to the file at the manipulated location.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy and run the `web_server.py` application on a test server. Ensure the 'target' directory exists in the same directory as `web_server.py`.
    2. Open a terminal and use `curl` to send a POST request to the `/file` endpoint with a path traversal filename.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
         -F "file=@/dev/urandom" \
         "http://<server_ip>:8000/file/../../../../tmp/evil.txt"
    ```
    Replace `<server_ip>` with the actual IP address or hostname where `web_server.py` is running. `/dev/urandom` is used as a dummy file for upload content.

    3. After executing the `curl` command, log in to the test server using SSH or console access.
    4. Check if the file `evil.txt` has been created in the `/tmp` directory.

    ```bash
    ls -l /tmp/evil.txt
    ```

    5. If the file `/tmp/evil.txt` exists, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the attacker was able to write a file outside the intended 'target' directory.
