- Vulnerability Name: Missing API Key Format Validation in API Server Middleware

- Description:
An attacker could bypass basic API key validation by providing an API key in an unexpected format, potentially if the system relies on client-side validation or makes assumptions about the format of the API key.
1. An attacker crafts a request to the ParallelAccel API endpoint, such as `/api/v1/jobs/sample/submit`.
2. Instead of providing an API key in the expected format (e.g., a UUID or a specific string pattern), the attacker provides an API key with a malformed or unexpected format in the `x-api-key` header. For example, the attacker might use an empty string, a string with special characters, or a string that is excessively long.
3. The `extract_api_key` middleware in `/code/parallel_accel/Server/src/middleware.py` extracts the API key from the `x-api-key` header.
4. The middleware only checks for the *presence* of the API key and does not perform any format validation. It extracts the key value and places it in the request context.
5. If the backend services that consume this API key also lack proper format validation and rely solely on the middleware's extraction, the attacker's malformed API key might be processed, potentially bypassing expected security checks or causing unexpected behavior in downstream components.

- Impact:
An attacker might bypass intended API access controls if backend services do not perform sufficient validation on the API key format, relying solely on the middleware for API key extraction. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to ParallelAccel library functionalities and data, depending on the backend's authorization implementation.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The project implements API key extraction in middleware located in `/code/parallel_accel/Server/src/middleware.py`. This middleware ensures that an API key is present in the request headers.

- Missing Mitigations:
Missing is input validation for the API key format within the `extract_api_key` middleware. The middleware should validate that the API key conforms to an expected format (e.g., length, character set, UUID format) before passing it to the request context.

- Preconditions:
An attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the ParallelAccel API server.

- Source Code Analysis:
```python
File: /code/parallel_accel/Server/src/middleware.py
Content:
...
def extract_api_key(request: sanic.request.Request) -> None:
    """Verifies if API token is present in the reuqest headers and extracts it's
    value to the request context.

    Args:
        request: Incoming HTTP Request object.

    Throws:
        sanic.exceptions.Unauthorized if the API key is missing.
    """
    api_key = request.headers.get("x-api-key", None)
    if not api_key:
        raise sanic.exceptions.Unauthorized("Missing API key")

    request.ctx.api_key = api_key
```
The `extract_api_key` function in `middleware.py` retrieves the API key from the request headers using `request.headers.get("x-api-key", None)`. It then checks if `api_key` is truthy (i.e., not None or an empty string). If `api_key` is missing (None), it raises a `sanic.exceptions.Unauthorized` exception. However, if an API key is present (even if it's malformed), the middleware proceeds to set `request.ctx.api_key = api_key` without any format or content validation. This means any non-empty string provided as the API key will be accepted by the middleware.

- Security Test Case:
1. Send a POST request to the `/api/v1/jobs/sample/submit` endpoint of the ParallelAccel API.
2. Include the header `x-api-key` with a malformed value, for example: `x-api-key: !@#$invalid_api_key`.
3. Observe the server's response. If the server responds with an HTTP 200 OK or any other success status code (other than 401 Unauthorized due to a missing key), instead of rejecting the request due to the malformed API key, then the vulnerability exists. A secure configuration would reject the malformed API key, ideally with a 400 Bad Request or 401 Unauthorized status code, indicating an invalid API key format.
