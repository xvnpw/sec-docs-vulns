## Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Input Validation Vulnerability in Matrix Data Processing Leading to Remote Code Execution

    - **Description:**
    An attacker can exploit input validation weaknesses in the cloud infrastructure components when processing user-provided matrix data for distributed linear algebra operations. This involves sending maliciously crafted matrix data through the API endpoint responsible for receiving and processing linear algebra tasks. If the system lacks proper validation of matrix dimensions (e.g., number of rows and columns) or the data format itself before processing, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during deserialization or computation. By providing oversized dimensions or malformed data, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical memory regions. This can be achieved by sending a request to the API endpoint with a specially crafted matrix payload. Upon processing this malicious input by the server-side components, the vulnerability is triggered, leading to memory corruption. If exploited successfully, this memory corruption can be leveraged to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.

    - **Impact:**
    Remote code execution on the cloud infrastructure server. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control over the affected server. This can lead to data breaches, further attacks on the internal network, denial of service, and complete compromise of the cloud infrastructure. The severity is critical due to the potential for full system takeover.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Basic input validation using `marshmallow` schemas might be in place for high-level data structure validation (e.g., checking for expected fields and data types). The project uses `marshmallow` for schema definition, suggesting some level of input validation. However, it is unclear if these schemas are sufficient to prevent advanced input validation attacks, especially those targeting native C++ components that handle the core linear algebra operations. It's likely that the current mitigations do not include robust checks against oversized matrix dimensions or format-specific vulnerabilities at the lower levels of data processing in C++.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Robust Input Validation for Matrix Dimensions:** Implement strict validation checks to ensure that the dimensions of matrices (number of rows and columns) are within acceptable and safe limits. This should include checks against excessively large values that could lead to memory exhaustion or buffer overflows.
        - **Safe Deserialization Practices:** Employ safe deserialization techniques in C++ components that handle matrix data. This involves using dynamic memory allocation with proper size limits and bounds checking when processing variable-size matrix data. Avoid using fixed-size buffers for variable-length data without rigorous size validation.
        - **Format String Vulnerability Prevention:** Ensure that user-provided data is not directly used in format strings in logging or other operations, as this can lead to format string vulnerabilities and potential code execution.
        - **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Implement fuzzing and security testing specifically targeting the matrix data processing components. This should involve generating a wide range of valid and invalid matrix inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities in input handling and processing logic.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - The cloud infrastructure component responsible for processing user-provided matrix data must be publicly accessible or accessible to the attacker.
        - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the API endpoint that handles matrix data uploads or processing.
        - The targeted infrastructure component must lack sufficient input validation for matrix dimensions and data format.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
    To illustrate how this vulnerability could be triggered, let's consider a hypothetical scenario in the C++ backend code. Assume there's a function `processMatrixData` that receives matrix dimensions (rows, cols) and the matrix data itself.

    ```c++
    void processMatrixData(int rows, int cols, const char* data) {
        if (rows > MAX_ROWS || cols > MAX_COLS) { // Basic dimension check, might be insufficient MAX_ROWS/COLS
            // Handle error - but what if MAX_ROWS/COLS is too large?
            return;
        }
        size_t matrix_size = rows * cols * sizeof(double); // Assuming double matrix
        double* matrix = new double[rows * cols]; // Potential vulnerability: integer overflow in rows * cols
        if (matrix == nullptr) {
            // Handle memory allocation failure
            return;
        }
        memcpy(matrix, data, matrix_size); // Vulnerability: If data size is not validated against matrix_size, buffer overflow
        // ... further processing of the matrix ...
        delete[] matrix;
    }
    ```

    **Step-by-step vulnerability explanation in code:**

    1. **Integer Overflow in Size Calculation:** If `rows` and `cols` are sufficiently large, their product `rows * cols` can overflow, resulting in a small `matrix_size` value. For example, if `rows` and `cols` are close to the maximum integer value, their product can wrap around to a small positive number or even negative number (due to integer overflow).
    2. **Heap Buffer Overflow in `memcpy`:**  Even if `new double[rows * cols]` succeeds (due to the small `matrix_size` from overflow), the `memcpy(matrix, data, matrix_size)` will copy `matrix_size` bytes from `data` to `matrix`. However, if the actual size of `data` provided by the attacker is larger than the calculated `matrix_size` (which is small due to the overflow), `memcpy` will write beyond the allocated buffer `matrix`, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
    3. **Remote Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the `data` payload, an attacker can overwrite critical data structures on the heap, including function pointers or other control flow data. This can be exploited to redirect program execution to attacker-controlled code, achieving remote code execution.

    **Visualization:**

    Imagine a memory region on the heap allocated for `matrix`. Due to integer overflow, this region is smaller than expected. The `memcpy` operation, instructed to copy a larger amount of data from the attacker-controlled `data` buffer, overflows this allocated region, overwriting adjacent memory areas. This overwritten memory can contain critical program data, leading to crashes or, more seriously, exploitable control-flow hijacking.

    - **Security Test Case:**
    **Step-by-step test case to prove the vulnerability:**

    1. **Identify API Endpoint:** Determine the API endpoint used to submit matrix data for processing. This could be an HTTP endpoint like `/api/process_matrix` or similar. Assume it accepts JSON payload with matrix dimensions and data.
    2. **Craft Malicious JSON Payload:** Create a JSON payload with oversized matrix dimensions designed to trigger an integer overflow. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "rows": 2147483647,  // Maximum 32-bit integer value (or close to it)
      "cols": 2147483647,  // Maximum 32-bit integer value (or close to it)
      "data": "[... large amount of matrix data ...]" // Provide enough data to trigger overflow after size calculation
    }
    ```

       The `data` field should contain a large amount of arbitrary data, exceeding the (potentially overflowed) calculated buffer size. You might need to experiment with the size of `data` to reliably trigger the overflow. Start with a few MB of data and increase if needed.
    3. **Send Malicious Request:** Use `curl`, `Postman`, or a similar tool to send a POST request to the identified API endpoint with the crafted JSON payload. Ensure the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.
    4. **Monitor Server Behavior:** Observe the server's response and logs. Look for:
        - **Server Crash:** The server might crash due to the memory corruption. Check server logs for crash reports or error messages indicating memory access violations (e.g., segmentation fault).
        - **Error Responses:** The server might return an error response if some basic validation catches the oversized dimensions, but if the integer overflow happens before validation, this might be bypassed. Look for generic error messages or specific error codes related to memory allocation or processing errors.
        - **Successful Response (Unexpected):** If the server returns a success response despite the malicious input, it's a strong indicator that the vulnerability might be exploitable, but further investigation is needed to confirm RCE.
    5. **Advanced Exploitation (Optional, for deeper analysis):** If a crash or error is observed, try to refine the malicious payload to inject shellcode into the `data` field. This is a more advanced step and requires knowledge of the target system's architecture and memory layout. If successful, you could achieve remote code execution, proving the critical nature of the vulnerability. For initial validation, observing a crash due to oversized input is sufficient to demonstrate the input validation vulnerability and its potential for severe impact.

    By following these steps, an external attacker can attempt to exploit the potential input validation vulnerability and verify if it leads to a denial of service (crash) or, more critically, remote code execution.

- **Vulnerability Name:** API Key Exposure in Kubernetes Secret - Missing Encryption

    - **Description:**
        1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster where ParallelAccel is deployed. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes API server, compromising administrator credentials, or gaining access to the underlying cloud infrastructure.
        2. Once inside the cluster, the attacker examines the Kubernetes Secrets defined in the `gcp/k8s/base/worker/deployment.yaml` file. Specifically, they target the `working_area-asic-secret` Secret, which is used to store the API key for ASIC workers.
        3. The attacker discovers that the API key is stored in plaintext within the Kubernetes Secret. Kubernetes Secrets, by default, store data in base64 encoded format, which is not encryption and can be easily decoded.
        4. The attacker decodes the base64 encoded API key from the Secret.
        5. With the exposed API key, the attacker can now bypass authentication and authorization checks in the ParallelAccel API server. This allows them to send malicious requests directly to the API server, impersonating a legitimate ASIC worker.
    - **Impact:**
        - Information Leakage: Attackers can use the compromised API key to access sensitive data managed by the ParallelAccel service, potentially including job results, worker status, and configuration details.
        - Data Manipulation: By sending malicious requests with the compromised API key, attackers can manipulate computations performed by the ParallelAccel system, leading to incorrect results and potentially compromising the integrity of linear algebra operations.
        - Unauthorized Access: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the ParallelAccel service, potentially allowing them to control ASIC workers, submit malicious jobs, or disrupt service operations.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - None. The API key is stored in a Kubernetes Secret, which provides base64 encoding but not encryption.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Implement encryption for sensitive data, such as API keys, stored in Kubernetes Secrets. Kubernetes Secrets should be encrypted at rest using KMS (Key Management Service) or similar encryption mechanisms provided by the cloud provider.
        - Regularly rotate API keys to limit the window of opportunity for attackers in case of key compromise.
        - Consider using more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for inter-service communication, such as mutual TLS (mTLS) or service mesh policies, instead of relying solely on API keys.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - The ParallelAccel service is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
        - API keys for ASIC workers are stored in Kubernetes Secrets without encryption at rest.
        - The attacker has gained unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        1. File: `/code/parallel_accel/gcp/k8s/base/worker/deployment.yaml`
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: working_area-asic
        spec:
          # ...
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: asic-worker
                  # ...
                  env:
                    - name: API_KEY
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: working_area-asic-secret
                          key: API_KEY
        ```
        This Kubernetes Deployment configuration shows that the `API_KEY` environment variable for the `asic-worker` container is sourced from a Secret named `working_area-asic-secret`.
        2. File: `/code/parallel_accel/gcp/k8s/base/worker/kustomization.yaml` and Overlays
        These files define Kubernetes configurations but do not show any encryption configuration for the secrets. Terraform files in `/code/parallel_accel/gcp/terraform/` also do not show any KMS encryption enabled for Kubernetes secrets.
        3. File: `/code/parallel_accel/Simulator/Dockerfile`
        ```dockerfile
        # ...
        ENV API_KEY=""
        # ...
        ```
        The Dockerfile for the simulator shows that the `API_KEY` environment variable is expected to be set, confirming its use for authentication.
        4. File: `/code/parallel_accel/Server/src/middleware.py`
        ```python
        def extract_api_key(request: sanic.request.Request) -> None:
            """Verifies if API token is present in the reuqest headers and extracts it's
            value to the request context.
            # ...
            api_key = request.headers.get("x-api-key", None)
            if not api_key:
                raise sanic.exceptions.Unauthorized("Missing API key")

            request.ctx.api_key = api_key
        ```
        The `extract_api_key` middleware in the API server explicitly retrieves the API key from the `x-api-key` header, confirming that this key is used for authentication.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Pre-requisite: Gain access to the Kubernetes cluster where ParallelAccel service is running. Assume this is done through some vulnerability outside the scope of this code review.
        2. Step 1: Access Kubernetes Secrets: Use `kubectl` command-line tool to access Kubernetes secrets in the `default` namespace:
        ```bash
        kubectl get secret working_area-asic-secret -o yaml
        ```
        3. Step 2: Decode the API Key: In the output from the previous command, locate the `API_KEY` data under the `data` field. It will be base64 encoded. Decode it using `base64` command:
        ```bash
        echo "<base64_encoded_api_key>" | base64 -d
        ```
        Replace `<base64_encoded_api_key>` with the actual base64 encoded value from the Secret. The output will be the plaintext API key.
        4. Step 3: Test API Access with Exposed Key: Obtain the public endpoint for the ParallelAccel API service. Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a request to an API endpoint that requires authentication, including the decoded API key in the `x-api-key` header. For example, to get worker status:
        ```bash
        curl -H "x-api-key: <exposed_api_key>" http://<parallel_accel_api_endpoint>/api/v1/worker/status
        ```
        Replace `<exposed_api_key>` with the decoded API key and `<parallel_accel_api_endpoint>` with the actual service endpoint.
        5. Step 4: Verify Unauthorized Access: If the request in the previous step is successful (returns HTTP 200 OK or other success status instead of 401 Unauthorized), it confirms that the API key is exposed and can be used to bypass authentication. The attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.
