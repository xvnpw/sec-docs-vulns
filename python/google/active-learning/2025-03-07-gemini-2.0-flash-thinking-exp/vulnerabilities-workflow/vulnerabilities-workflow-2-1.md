- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Save Directory
  - Description:
    1. The `run_experiment.py` script uses the `--save_dir` flag to specify the directory where experiment outputs are saved.
    2. This flag's value is directly used in `os.path.join` to construct the output directory path without sufficient sanitization.
    3. An attacker can provide a malicious path like `/tmp/../../` as the `--save_dir` value.
    4. The `os.path.join` will resolve this path, potentially leading to writing files outside the intended `/tmp/toy_experiments` directory.
    5. For example, if the script attempts to save a log file in the constructed path, it might write files to a directory outside the intended save directory, or even to the root directory if permissions allow.
  - Impact:
    - File Overwrite: An attacker could potentially overwrite existing files in arbitrary directories if the script has write permissions in those locations.
    - Sensitive Information Disclosure (Less likely in this specific case, but possible in similar scenarios): If the script were to inadvertently read configuration or other files based on the traversed path, it could lead to information disclosure.
    - Code Execution (Less likely but theoretically possible): In highly specific scenarios, if an attacker could overwrite executable files or libraries, it could potentially lead to code execution, although this is not the primary risk here.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code uses `os.path.join` for path construction, which normalizes paths to some extent, but it does not prevent path traversal if malicious sequences like `../` are provided as input.
    - The script creates the save directory using `gfile.MkDir`, and handles potential errors if the directory already exists, but this is not a security mitigation against path traversal.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Missing validation of the `--save_dir` flag to ensure it is a safe path and does not contain path traversal sequences.
    - Path Sanitization: Lack of sanitization to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences from the user-provided input.
    - Restricting Base Directory:  The application should enforce that the save directory is always within a predefined safe base directory and reject any paths that attempt to go outside this base.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to run the `run_experiment.py` script and control the command-line arguments, specifically the `--save_dir` flag. This is typically the case for users running experiments with this module.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/run_experiment.py
    ...
    flags.DEFINE_string("save_dir", "/tmp/toy_experiments",
                        "Where to save outputs")
    FLAGS = flags.FLAGS

    def main(argv):
      del argv
      ...
      save_dir = os.path.join(
          FLAGS.save_dir,
          FLAGS.dataset + "_" + FLAGS.sampling_method)
      do_save = FLAGS.do_save == "True"

      if do_save:
        if not gfile.Exists(save_dir):
          try:
            gfile.MkDir(save_dir) # Directory creation, but no path sanitization beforehand
          except:
            print(('WARNING: error creating save directory, '
                   'directory most likely already created.'))
        # Set up logging
        filename = os.path.join(
            save_dir, "log-" + strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S", gmtime()) + ".txt") # Path constructed using unsanitized input
        sys.stdout = utils.Logger(filename) # Logger writes to file in potentially traversed path

        ...
        filename = os.path.join(save_dir, # Path constructed using unsanitized input
                                filename + "_" + str(1000+len(existing_files))[1:] + ".pkl")
        pickle.dump(all_results, gfile.GFile(filename, "w")) # Pickle dump to file in potentially traversed path
    ```
    - The `save_dir` variable is constructed using `os.path.join(FLAGS.save_dir, ...)` where `FLAGS.save_dir` is directly taken from user input without validation.
    - `gfile.MkDir`, `utils.Logger` (which creates a file), and `pickle.dump` all use the potentially attacker-controlled `save_dir` to perform file system operations.
  - Security Test Case:
    1.  Assume you have access to run `run_experiment.py`.
    2.  Execute the following command:
        ```bash
        python run_experiment.py --dataset test_dataset --sampling_method uniform --score_method logistic --save_dir "/tmp/attack_test/../../" --do_save True
        ```
    3.  After the script executes, check the `/tmp/attack_test/` directory.
    4.  Vulnerability Validation: If files (like `log-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.txt` or `results_score_logistic_select_None_norm_False_stand_True_000.pkl`) are created in `/tmp/attack_test/` (or even higher directories depending on permissions and path resolution), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. The intended behavior was for files to be saved under `/tmp/toy_experiments` or a subdirectory within it, not directly under `/tmp/attack_test/`.
