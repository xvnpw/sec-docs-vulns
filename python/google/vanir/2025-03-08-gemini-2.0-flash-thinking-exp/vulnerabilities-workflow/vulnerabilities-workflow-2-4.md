- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML report generation

- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a CVE entry with a specially crafted `patch` URL containing the payload.
    2. When Vanir processes this CVE entry, the malicious payload from the `patch` URL is incorporated into the vulnerability report data.
    3. The `detector_runner.py` generates an HTML report using Jinja2 template, embedding the vulnerability data, including the attacker's payload, into the HTML report without proper sanitization of the `options` variable.
    4. When a user opens the generated HTML report in a web browser, the injected JavaScript code from the `options` is executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- Impact:
    - Critical. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they open the Vanir HTML report. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing of sensitive information, defacement of the report, or further malicious actions depending on the context and permissions of the user viewing the report.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `options` variable in the HTML report is rendered without any sanitization or escaping.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output sanitization: The `options` variable, which is derived from command-line arguments, should be properly sanitized before being embedded into the HTML report. Jinja2's autoescape feature should be enabled for the `options` variable, or the `options` variable should be passed through a sanitization function to escape HTML entities and prevent XSS.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to influence the vulnerability data that Vanir processes. This could be achieved by:
        - Submitting a malicious CVE entry to a public vulnerability database that Vanir uses (e.g., OSV), if Vanir directly consumes data from public OSV without curation.
        - Providing a malicious custom signature file to Vanir via the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag, if the user is tricked into using a malicious file.
    2. A user needs to run Vanir with the malicious vulnerability data and open the generated HTML report in a web browser.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/detector_runner.py`
    2. Vulnerable code block:
    ```python
    _HTML_REPORT_TEMPLATE = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        ...
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Vanir Detector Report {{ report_file_name }}</h1>
        <h3 onclick="toggle(this);" class="expand-toggle collapsed">Options</h3>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">{{ options }}</pre>
        ...
      </body>
    </html>
    """

    def _generate_html_report(
        report_file_name: str,
        report_book: reporter.ReportBook,
        covered_cves: Sequence[str],
        stats: scanner_base.ScannedFileStats,
    ) -> None:
      ...
      html_report = template.render(
          report_file_name=report_file_name,
          ...,
          options=' '.join(sys.argv[1:]), # Vulnerable point: options is taken directly from command line args
          metadata=metadata,
          errors=stats.errors,
      )
      ...
    ```
    3. The `_HTML_REPORT_TEMPLATE` in `detector_runner.py` uses Jinja2 templating to generate the HTML report.
    4. The `{{ options }}` block in the template directly embeds the `options` variable into the HTML output within a `<pre>` tag.
    5. The `_generate_html_report` function in `detector_runner.py` populates the `options` variable with `' '.join(sys.argv[1:])`. `sys.argv[1:]` directly contains the command-line arguments provided when running `detector_runner.py`.
    6. There is no HTML sanitization or escaping applied to the `options` variable before rendering it in the HTML report.
    7. An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through command-line arguments when running `detector_runner.py`. This injected code will be included in the `options` variable and rendered directly in the HTML report without escaping.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious vulnerability JSON file (e.g., `malicious_vuln.json`) with a crafted CVE entry. The crafted CVE entry should include a `patch` URL field that contains a JavaScript payload in the URL itself. For example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "VANIR-XSS-TEST",
        "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "affected": [
          {
            "package": {
              "name": "test_package",
              "ecosystem": "Android"
            },
            "versions": ["1.0"]
          }
        ],
        "references": [
          {
            "type": "FIX",
            "url": "https://example.com/path?param=<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>"
          }
        ],
        "details": "Test XSS vulnerability"
      }
    ]
    ```
    2. Run Vanir Detector Runner, providing the malicious vulnerability file using the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag and inject a test option "--test-option=<img src=x onerror=alert('test-xss-options')>":
    ```posix-terminal
    ./bazel-bin/detector_runner \
      --vulnerability_file_name malicious_vuln.json \
      --report_file_name_prefix /tmp/xss_report \
      --test-option="<img src=x onerror=alert('test-xss-options')>" \
      offline_directory_scanner /tmp/test_code
    ```
    3. Open the generated HTML report file `/tmp/xss_report.html` in a web browser.
    4. Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" and "test-xss-options" is displayed, demonstrating that the JavaScript code injected through both the vulnerability data and command-line options was executed.
