## Combined Vulnerability List

### Insecure Deserialization via Vulnerability File

- **Vulnerability name:** Insecure Deserialization via Vulnerability File

- **Description:**
    An attacker could craft a malicious JSON vulnerability file and supply it to Vanir Detector Runner using the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag. If Vanir Detector Runner deserializes this file without proper validation, it could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches. The vulnerability arises from the potential for insecure deserialization of the JSON vulnerability data, where malicious data within the JSON could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process itself, or in the way Vanir processes the deserialized data.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious JSON file crafted to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities. This file is designed to be superficially valid according to the expected vulnerability file format, but contains malicious payloads in fields that are processed during deserialization.
    2. The attacker runs the Vanir Detector Runner, providing the path to the malicious JSON file using the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag. For example: `./bazel-bin/detector_runner --vulnerability_file_name /path/to/malicious.json offline_directory_scanner /test/source`
    3. Vanir Detector Runner attempts to parse and load the vulnerability data from the provided malicious JSON file.
    4. If the JSON deserialization process is vulnerable, or if Vanir processes the deserialized data insecurely, the attacker's malicious payload is executed.

- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system running Vanir Detector Runner. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service. The attacker gains control over the Vanir execution environment, inheriting its privileges.

- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None. The code does not implement any specific sanitization or validation of the input vulnerability file beyond basic JSON parsing. The `vulnerability_manager.generate_from_file` function directly loads JSON data without custom deserialization or security checks.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    Input validation and sanitization for the vulnerability file. Implement secure deserialization practices to prevent code injection or arbitrary code execution. Specifically:
        - Implement schema validation for the vulnerability JSON file to ensure it conforms to the expected structure and data types.
        - Sanitize and validate all data read from the JSON file before using it in Vanir's logic.
        - Consider using a safe JSON parsing library that is less susceptible to deserialization attacks.
        - Implement principle of least privilege for Vanir execution environment to limit the impact of successful exploitation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JSON file path to the Vanir Detector Runner, which is typically done via command-line arguments.
    - The Vanir Detector Runner must be executed and process the malicious vulnerability file using the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. The `detector_runner.py` script uses `detector_common_flags.generate_vuln_manager_from_flags()` to create a `VulnerabilityManager`.
    2. `detector_common_flags.generate_vuln_manager_from_flags()` in turn calls `vulnerability_manager.generate_from_file()` if `--vulnerability_file_name` is provided.
    3. `vulnerability_manager.generate_from_file()` directly uses `json.load(vul_file)` to load the JSON data from the provided file:
       ```python
       def generate_from_file(
           file_name: str,
           vulnerability_filters: Optional[Sequence[VulnerabilityFilter]] = None,
           vulnerability_overwrite_specs: Optional[
               Sequence[vulnerability_overwriter.OverwriteSpec]
           ] = None,
       ) -> VulnerabilityManager:
           ...
           with open(vul_file_path, 'rt') as vul_file:
               vulnerabilities = json.load(vul_file) # Insecure deserialization
           ...
           return VulnerabilityManager(
               vulnerabilities,
               vulnerability_filters=vulnerability_filters,
           )
       ```
    4. The `json.load()` function in Python, while generally safe for simple JSON parsing, can be vulnerable if the application logic processing the deserialized data is susceptible to exploitation based on the content of the JSON. In this case, the vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the structure and content of the JSON file, which could allow for malicious data injection.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a malicious JSON file named `malicious_vuln.json` with the following content. This is a simplified example, a real exploit might involve more complex payloads:
    ```json
    {
        "__class__": "str",
        "__init__": "system",
        "__args__": ["touch /tmp/vanir_vuln_pwned"]
    }
    ```
       This JSON payload attempts to leverage Python's deserialization process to execute the `system` command to create a file `/tmp/vanir_vuln_pwned`. Note: This specific payload is a simplified example and may not work directly due to security restrictions in the environment and Python versions used by Vanir, but it illustrates the principle of insecure deserialization. More sophisticated payloads could be crafted depending on the environment and libraries used.

    2. Run Vanir Detector Runner with the malicious JSON file:
    ```posix-terminal
    ./bazel-bin/detector_runner --vulnerability_file_name malicious_vuln.json offline_directory_scanner /tmp/test_scanner
    ```
    3. After running the command, check if the file `/tmp/vanir_vuln_pwned` exists. If the file exists, it indicates successful (though in this example, benign) code execution due to insecure deserialization.
    ```posix-terminal
    ls -l /tmp/vanir_vuln_pwned
    ```
       If the file `/tmp/vanir_vuln_pwned` is listed, the vulnerability is confirmed.

    Note: This security test case is a simplified example and might need adjustments based on the actual environment and Python version used by Vanir. The core principle of testing is to inject data within the JSON vulnerability file that, when deserialized, could lead to unintended code execution or behavior within the Vanir Detector Runner application. A more robust test case would involve crafting a payload that is specifically tailored to exploit potential weaknesses in the libraries and environment used by Vanir.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML report generation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML report generation

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a CVE entry with a specially crafted `patch` URL containing the payload.
    2. When Vanir processes this CVE entry, the malicious payload from the `patch` URL is incorporated into the vulnerability report data.
    3. The `detector_runner.py` generates an HTML report using Jinja2 template, embedding the vulnerability data, including the attacker's payload, into the HTML report without proper sanitization of the `options` variable.
    4. When a user opens the generated HTML report in a web browser, the injected JavaScript code from the `options` is executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- **Impact:**
    Critical. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they open the Vanir HTML report. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing of sensitive information, defacement of the report, or further malicious actions depending on the context and permissions of the user viewing the report.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The `options` variable in the HTML report is rendered without any sanitization or escaping.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    Output sanitization: The `options` variable, which is derived from command-line arguments, should be properly sanitized before being embedded into the HTML report. Jinja2's autoescape feature should be enabled for the `options` variable, or the `options` variable should be passed through a sanitization function to escape HTML entities and prevent XSS.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. An attacker needs to be able to influence the vulnerability data that Vanir processes. This could be achieved by:
        - Submitting a malicious CVE entry to a public vulnerability database that Vanir uses (e.g., OSV), if Vanir directly consumes data from public OSV without curation.
        - Providing a malicious custom signature file to Vanir via the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag, if the user is tricked into using a malicious file.
    2. A user needs to run Vanir with the malicious vulnerability data and open the generated HTML report in a web browser.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/detector_runner.py`
    2. Vulnerable code block:
    ```python
    _HTML_REPORT_TEMPLATE = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        ...
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Vanir Detector Report {{ report_file_name }}</h1>
        <h3 onclick="toggle(this);" class="expand-toggle collapsed">Options</h3>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">{{ options }}</pre>
        ...
      </body>
    </html>
    """

    def _generate_html_report(
        report_file_name: str,
        report_book: reporter.ReportBook,
        covered_cves: Sequence[str],
        stats: scanner_base.ScannedFileStats,
    ) -> None:
      ...
      html_report = template.render(
          report_file_name=report_file_name,
          ...,
          options=' '.join(sys.argv[1:]), # Vulnerable point: options is taken directly from command line args
          metadata=metadata,
          errors=stats.errors,
      )
      ...
    ```
    3. The `_HTML_REPORT_TEMPLATE` in `detector_runner.py` uses Jinja2 templating to generate the HTML report.
    4. The `{{ options }}` block in the template directly embeds the `options` variable into the HTML output within a `<pre>` tag.
    5. The `_generate_html_report` function in `detector_runner.py` populates the `options` variable with `' '.join(sys.argv[1:])`. `sys.argv[1:]` directly contains the command-line arguments provided when running `detector_runner.py`.
    6. There is no HTML sanitization or escaping applied to the `options` variable before rendering it in the HTML report.
    7. An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through command-line arguments when running `detector_runner.py`. This injected code will be included in the `options` variable and rendered directly in the HTML report without escaping.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Prepare a malicious vulnerability JSON file (e.g., `malicious_vuln.json`) with a crafted CVE entry. The crafted CVE entry should include a `patch` URL field that contains a JavaScript payload in the URL itself. For example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "VANIR-XSS-TEST",
        "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "affected": [
          {
            "package": {
              "name": "test_package",
              "ecosystem": "Android"
            },
            "versions": ["1.0"]
          }
        ],
        "references": [
          {
            "type": "FIX",
            "url": "https://example.com/path?param=<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>"
          }
        ],
        "details": "Test XSS vulnerability"
      }
    ]
    ```
    2. Run Vanir Detector Runner, providing the malicious vulnerability file using the `--vulnerability_file_name` flag and inject a test option "--test-option=<img src=x onerror=alert('test-xss-options')>":
    ```posix-terminal
    ./bazel-bin/detector_runner \
      --vulnerability_file_name malicious_vuln.json \
      --report_file_name_prefix /tmp/xss_report \
      --test-option="<img src=x onerror=alert('test-xss-options')>" \
      offline_directory_scanner /tmp/test_code
    ```
    3. Open the generated HTML report file `/tmp/xss_report.html` in a web browser.
    4. Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" and "test-xss-options" is displayed, demonstrating that the JavaScript code injected through both the vulnerability data and command-line options was executed.
