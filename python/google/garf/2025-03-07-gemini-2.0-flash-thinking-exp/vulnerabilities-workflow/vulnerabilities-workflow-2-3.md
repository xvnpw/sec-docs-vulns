### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection-like vulnerability in SQL-like query parsing

- Description:
    - The `garf` framework uses a "SQL-like interface" to allow users to specify data extraction from reporting APIs.
    - If the parsing and processing of these SQL-like queries are not properly handled, an attacker might be able to inject malicious SQL-like syntax to manipulate the generated API requests.
    - This could lead to unauthorized data access, where the attacker can extract more data than intended or access data they are not supposed to.
    - For example, an attacker might try to inject conditions or clauses into the SQL-like query that are not intended by the application logic, potentially bypassing intended data access restrictions.

- Impact:
    - Unauthorized data access.
    - An attacker could potentially bypass access controls of the reporting APIs and extract sensitive information.
    - Depending on the API and the data it exposes, this could lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and other security incidents.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the provided files (README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md), there is no information about specific security measures implemented to prevent SQL injection-like vulnerabilities. Without access to the source code, it's impossible to determine if any mitigations are in place.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The framework should sanitize user-provided SQL-like queries to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or syntax before processing them.
    - Parameterized queries or equivalent mechanisms: Instead of directly embedding user-provided parts of the SQL-like query into API requests, the framework should use parameterized queries or similar techniques to separate code from data. This prevents malicious SQL-like syntax from being interpreted as commands.
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation of the SQL-like query structure and its components to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and constraints.
    - Least privilege principle: Ensure that the API requests generated by the framework only request the necessary data and have the minimum required permissions.

- Preconditions:
    - A user must be able to provide SQL-like queries to the `garf` framework.
    - The `garf` framework must process these queries and translate them into API requests without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - The underlying reporting API must be vulnerable to manipulation via crafted requests derived from the SQL-like injection.

- Source code analysis:
    - Source code is not provided in PROJECT FILES, so detailed source code analysis is not possible.
    - Based on the description in `README.md`, the framework "constructs the correct query to a reporting API of your choice" from the user-provided SQL-like query.
    - This process of constructing API queries from user input is the critical point where SQL injection-like vulnerabilities can be introduced if not handled securely.
    - To confirm and detail the vulnerability, the following code sections would need to be analyzed:
        - Code responsible for parsing the SQL-like query.
        - Code responsible for translating the parsed SQL-like query into API requests.
        - Code that handles user input and incorporates it into the API request construction.
    - Without the code, it's hypothesized that a lack of proper input sanitization and parameterized query generation in these sections could lead to the vulnerability.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup: Assume you have access to a test instance of `garf` connected to a reporting API (or a mock API for testing). You need to be able to submit SQL-like queries to this instance.
    2. Craft a malicious SQL-like query:  Design a query that attempts to extract additional data or manipulate the query logic beyond what a normal query should allow. For example, if a normal query is `SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_table WHERE date = '2024-01-01'`, try injecting a condition to bypass the date filter or add fields: `SELECT field1, field2, sensitive_field FROM report_table WHERE date = '2024-01-01' OR 1=1`.  The specific injection will depend on the expected syntax of the SQL-like interface and the API it targets.
    3. Submit the malicious query: Send the crafted SQL-like query to the `garf` instance.
    4. Observe the API request: Monitor the actual API request generated by `garf` based on your malicious SQL-like query. Examine if the injected parts of your query are directly included in the API request without proper encoding or parameterization.
    5. Analyze the API response: Check the response from the reporting API.
        - If the response contains data for `sensitive_field` (which should not be accessible normally) or data outside of `'2024-01-01'` (due to `OR 1=1`), it indicates a successful SQL injection-like attack.
        - If the API returns an error due to invalid syntax or authorization, it might indicate some level of input validation, but further testing with different injection techniques would be needed.
    6. Expected result: Successful exploitation would mean retrieving data beyond the scope of intended queries, confirming the SQL injection-like vulnerability. A secure system would either reject the malicious query or sanitize it in a way that prevents unintended data access.
