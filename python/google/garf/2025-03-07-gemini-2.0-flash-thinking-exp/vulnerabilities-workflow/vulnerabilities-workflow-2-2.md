- Vulnerability Name: SQL-like Injection in API Query Generation
- Description: A user-provided SQL-like query is processed by `garf` to generate API requests. If the framework doesn't properly sanitize or validate the user input within the SQL-like query, an attacker could inject malicious SQL-like syntax. This could lead to the generation of unintended or malicious API requests, potentially bypassing access controls or extracting more data than intended from the reporting API. For example, an attacker might be able to manipulate the query to access data from different API endpoints or use API functionalities in unintended ways that are not intended by the application developers.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive information from reporting APIs, potential data breaches, or manipulation of data within the reporting system depending on the API capabilities. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the data exposed by the reporting APIs.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Not evident from the provided files. Based on the description, the framework is designed to process SQL-like queries, but the provided documentation doesn't mention any specific input validation or sanitization mechanisms to prevent injection attacks.  It is unknown if mitigations are implemented within the codebase without further analysis of `garf-core` and `garf-executors` libraries.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation of the SQL-like query are crucial. The framework needs to ensure that user-provided queries are parsed and transformed into API requests safely, preventing injection attacks.  Specifically, it should:
    - Implement strict parsing and validation of the SQL-like query structure.
    - Define a whitelist of allowed keywords, functions, and operators in the SQL-like syntax.
    - Sanitize user-provided values within the query to prevent injection of malicious payloads.
    - Consider using parameterized queries or an ORM-like approach when constructing API requests to avoid direct string concatenation of user inputs into API query parameters.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the SQL-like query that `garf` processes. This could be through a user interface, configuration file, API endpoint, or any mechanism that allows users to define or modify the SQL-like queries used by `garf`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided `README.md`, `garf` takes SQL-like queries as input and transforms them into API requests. The description states that `garf` "constructs the correct query to a reporting API of your choice, automatically extract all necessary fields from API schema and transform them into a structure suitable for writing data."
    - Without access to the source code of `garf-core` and `garf-executors` (where the query parsing and API request generation logic would reside), it's impossible to pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability.
    - **Assumed Vulnerable Code Flow (Hypothetical):**
        1. User provides a SQL-like query string.
        2. `garf` parses this query string to identify parameters, fields, and conditions.
        3. `garf` constructs an API request string by embedding parts of the parsed SQL-like query (potentially including user-provided values) directly into the API request.
        4. If step 3 involves string concatenation without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates an SQL-like injection vulnerability.
    - **Visualization (Hypothetical):**
        ```
        User Query Input --> [Garf Query Parser] --> [API Request Constructor (Vulnerable String Concatenation?)] --> API Request
                                                    ^ Potential Injection Point
        ```
    - **Example of Potential Vulnerable Code Snippet (Python - Hypothetical):**
        ```python
        def construct_api_request(sql_query):
            parsed_query = parse_sql_like_query(sql_query) # Hypothetical parsing function
            api_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/reports"
            api_query_params = {}
            if "fields" in parsed_query:
                api_query_params["fields"] = ",".join(parsed_query["fields"]) # Potential Injection if fields are not validated
            if "filter" in parsed_query:
                api_query_params["filter"] = parsed_query["filter"] # High Injection Risk - direct inclusion of filter
            # ... other parameters based on parsed_query ...

            api_request_url = f"{api_endpoint}?{'&'.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in api_query_params.items()])}" # Vulnerable string formatting
            return api_request_url
        ```
        In this hypothetical example, if the `parse_sql_like_query` function doesn't sanitize or validate the `fields` and `filter` components from the user-provided SQL-like query, an attacker could inject malicious API query parameters by crafting a special SQL-like query.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a `garf` application (if possible based on available code - if not, a test harness mimicking `garf`'s query processing would be needed). Assume there is a user interface or API endpoint where a user can input a SQL-like query. Configure `garf` to connect to a mock reporting API (can be simulated).
    2. **Craft Malicious SQL-like Query:**  Assume the SQL-like syntax supports a `FILTER` clause. Craft a malicious query to attempt API parameter injection through the `FILTER` clause. For example, if the API uses a parameter named `api_key` for authentication, try to inject or manipulate this parameter.
        - Malicious Query Example (Hypothetical SQL-like syntax): `SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_data WHERE FILTER=api_key=malicious_value`
        - Another example trying to add unexpected parameters: `SELECT field1 FROM report_data WHERE condition=true & extra_param=malicious_injection`
    3. **Execute Query:** Submit the crafted malicious query to the `garf` application through the user interface or API endpoint.
    4. **Observe API Request:** Intercept or log the actual HTTP API request generated by `garf` and sent to the mock reporting API. Examine the URL and request parameters.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:** Check if the injected malicious parameters or values are present in the API request. Analyze the API response.
        - If the attack is successful, you might observe:
            - The API request contains the injected `api_key=malicious_value` or `extra_param=malicious_injection`.
            - The API responds with data that should not be accessible with a legitimate query, or an error message indicating unexpected parameters are processed, or a change in behavior of the API interaction.
        - For example, if injecting `api_key=malicious_value` results in successful data retrieval even without proper authentication, it demonstrates a successful injection and bypass of intended access controls.

This vulnerability analysis is based on the description of `garf` and assumptions about potential implementation weaknesses. A complete assessment requires a thorough review of the source code, especially the `garf-core` and `garf-executors` libraries, and concrete security testing against a running instance of `garf`.
