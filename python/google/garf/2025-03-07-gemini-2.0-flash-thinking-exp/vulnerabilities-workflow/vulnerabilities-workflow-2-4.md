### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Potential SQL Injection-like Vulnerability in Query Parsing and API Query Generation
* Description:
    1. The `garf` framework takes SQL-like queries as input from users to define data extraction from reporting APIs.
    2. The framework parses these SQL-like queries and generates corresponding API requests to fetch the data.
    3. If the framework does not properly sanitize or validate the SQL-like input during parsing and API query generation, an attacker could craft malicious SQL-like queries.
    4. These malicious queries could inject unexpected parameters or conditions into the generated API requests.
    5. By manipulating the API requests, the attacker could potentially bypass intended access controls, retrieve unauthorized data, or cause errors in the API interaction.
* Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data from the reporting APIs.
    - Potential data breaches by exfiltrating more data than intended.
    - Information disclosure through manipulated API responses.
    - Possible disruption of reporting API functionality if crafted queries cause errors or overload the API.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), there are no explicitly mentioned mitigations for SQL injection-like vulnerabilities. The documentation focuses on the framework's architecture and contribution guidelines, not security measures.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** The framework should rigorously sanitize and validate all user-provided SQL-like query components before parsing and using them to construct API requests. This should include checks for unexpected characters, SQL keywords used in malicious contexts, and adherence to a defined query structure.
    - **Parameterized API Queries:** Instead of directly embedding user-provided values into API query strings, the framework should use parameterized queries or prepared statements where supported by the target APIs. This prevents malicious code from being directly interpreted as part of the API query logic.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The framework's API interactions should adhere to the principle of least privilege, only requesting the minimum necessary data and using API credentials with restricted permissions. This limits the potential damage from a successful injection attack.
    - **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regular security audits and code reviews, especially focusing on query parsing and API interaction logic, are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the SQL-like query input to the `garf` framework. This precondition depends on how the framework is deployed and used. For example, if the framework is used in a web application where users can input SQL-like queries, or if queries are read from user-controlled configuration files.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - **Analysis is not possible with the provided files.** The provided files are limited to `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which are documentation files. To perform a source code analysis for SQL injection-like vulnerabilities, access to the source code of the `garf-core`, `garf-io`, `garf-executors`, and `garf-community` libraries (especially the query parsing and API request generation modules) is required.
    - **Hypothetical Vulnerability Location:** Based on the framework description, the vulnerability would likely reside in the modules responsible for:
        - Parsing the SQL-like query string.
        - Constructing the API request based on the parsed query.
        - Handling user-provided inputs (e.g., table names, column names, filter conditions) within the query processing logic.
    - **Without access to the code, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact vulnerable lines or functions.** Further investigation requires examining the source code of the mentioned libraries.
* Security Test Case:
    - **Test case cannot be implemented with the provided files.**  A security test case requires a running instance of the `garf` framework and the ability to interact with it by providing SQL-like queries.
    - **Hypothetical Test Case Steps (Requires Code and Setup):**
        1. Set up a test environment with a running instance of the `garf` framework connected to a mock reporting API (to avoid testing against a real API).
        2. Identify the interface or method through which SQL-like queries are submitted to the framework.
        3. Craft a series of malicious SQL-like queries designed to test for injection vulnerabilities. Examples:
            - Injecting additional conditions in `WHERE` clauses to bypass filters (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1`).
            - Attempting to access unauthorized tables or columns if the framework allows specifying these in the query.
            - Injecting SQL commands or syntax that are not intended to be supported by the framework but might be misinterpreted during API query generation.
        4. Submit each malicious query to the framework.
        5. Observe the generated API requests sent to the mock API.
        6. Analyze the API responses and the data retrieved by the framework.
        7. Verify if the malicious queries resulted in:
            - Retrieval of data that should not have been accessible based on intended query logic.
            - Errors or unexpected behavior in the framework or the mock API due to malformed requests.
        8. Document the successful injection attempts and the resulting impact to confirm the vulnerability.
