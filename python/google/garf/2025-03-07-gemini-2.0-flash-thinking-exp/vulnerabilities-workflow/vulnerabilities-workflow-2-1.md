- Vulnerability Name: SQL-like Injection
- Description: A user can craft a malicious SQL-like query that, when processed by `garf`, is not properly sanitized and leads to the execution of unintended API requests. This could allow an attacker to bypass intended access controls and extract sensitive data or manipulate data within the reporting API. For example, an attacker might inject clauses to access data outside the scope of their intended query, or manipulate data if the API allows such operations.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data from the reporting API, potential data manipulation within the reporting API depending on the API's capabilities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None apparent from the provided documentation. The description emphasizes the risk of SQL-like injection, suggesting that mitigations might be missing or insufficient.
- Missing Mitigations: Robust input sanitization and validation of the SQL-like queries before they are translated into API requests. This should include:
    - Input validation to ensure queries conform to the expected SQL-like syntax and structure.
    - Parameterization of API requests to prevent injection of malicious code through query parameters.
    - Least privilege principle applied to API requests, ensuring that the framework only requests the data that is strictly necessary for the user's query.
- Preconditions:
    - Access to the `garf` framework and the ability to submit SQL-like queries.
    - The `garf` framework must translate the SQL-like queries into API requests without proper sanitization.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - No source code is provided in these files.
    - Based on the description in `README.md`, the vulnerability would likely reside in the modules responsible for:
        1. Parsing the SQL-like query.
        2. Translating the SQL-like query into API-specific requests.
        3. Executing the API requests.
    - The lack of input sanitization in the query parsing and translation steps would allow malicious SQL-like syntax to be embedded into the generated API requests.
    - For instance, if the framework directly substitutes parts of the SQL-like query into API request strings without validation, injection is highly likely.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Assume you have access to a `garf` instance connected to a reporting API. You also have basic knowledge of the SQL-like syntax supported by `garf`.
    2. **Craft Malicious Query:** Construct a SQL-like query that attempts to extract data beyond your intended scope. For example, if the SQL-like syntax supports some form of conditional logic or the ability to specify fields, try to add conditions or field requests that should normally be restricted. Example (assuming a hypothetical SQL-like syntax):
       ```sql
       SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_table WHERE condition1; -- Normal query

       SELECT field1, field2, sensitive_field FROM report_table WHERE condition1; -- Attempt to access 'sensitive_field'
       ```
       Or, if UNION-like operations are possible:
       ```sql
       SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_table WHERE condition1 UNION SELECT secret_field1, secret_field2 FROM secret_report_table; -- Attempt to access 'secret_report_table'
       ```
    3. **Execute Query:** Submit the crafted malicious query to the `garf` framework.
    4. **Observe Results:** Examine the response from `garf`.
        - **Vulnerability Confirmation:** If `garf` returns data from `sensitive_field` or `secret_report_table` (or any data that should be restricted based on intended access controls), it indicates a successful SQL-like injection vulnerability.
        - **No Vulnerability:** If `garf` returns an error, or only returns data corresponding to the intended scope of the original query (before injection attempts), it suggests that some form of sanitization or access control might be in place (though further testing might be needed to confirm robustness).
