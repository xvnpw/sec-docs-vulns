### SQL-like Injection Vulnerability

This vulnerability arises from the `garf` framework's processing of user-provided SQL-like queries to interact with reporting APIs. If `garf` fails to properly sanitize and validate these queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL-like syntax. This injection can manipulate the API requests generated by `garf`, potentially leading to unauthorized data access and other security breaches. The core issue is the lack of secure handling of user input within the SQL-like query parsing and API request construction processes.

#### Vulnerability Name
SQL-like Injection

#### Description
The `garf` framework is designed to translate user-provided SQL-like queries into API requests for data retrieval from reporting APIs. This functionality introduces a vulnerability if the framework does not adequately sanitize or validate the input queries. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious SQL-like queries that inject unintended parameters or conditions into the generated API requests. By injecting malicious SQL-like syntax, an attacker can:

1. **Bypass Access Controls:**  Manipulate the query to access data beyond their authorized scope, potentially retrieving information from different API endpoints or tables that should be restricted.
2. **Extract Sensitive Data:** Craft queries to extract sensitive fields or records that are not intended to be accessible through normal query operations.
3. **Manipulate API Logic:** In some cases, depending on the API's capabilities and the injection point, attackers might be able to manipulate the API's behavior in unintended ways, potentially leading to data manipulation or disruption of service (although DoS vulnerabilities are excluded from this report, other forms of manipulation might be possible depending on API capabilities).

For example, an attacker might inject additional clauses into a `WHERE` condition to bypass intended filters or use `UNION`-like operations (if supported by the SQL-like syntax and underlying API) to access data from different tables or API endpoints not intended for their access.

#### Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to significant security breaches:

- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information from the reporting APIs that they are not authorized to view.
- **Data Breaches:** The vulnerability could be exploited to exfiltrate large amounts of sensitive data, leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
- **Information Disclosure:** Manipulated API responses might disclose confidential information that should not be publicly accessible.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** Depending on the API's capabilities, there is a risk of data manipulation within the reporting system, although the primary risk is unauthorized data access.

The severity of the impact depends on the sensitivity of the data exposed by the reporting APIs and the extent to which access controls can be bypassed.

#### Vulnerability Rank
High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
Based on the provided documentation (`README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`), there is no mention of specific security measures implemented to prevent SQL-like injection vulnerabilities.  It is **not apparent from the documentation** that any input sanitization, validation, or parameterized query mechanisms are in place.

Without access to the source code of `garf-core` and `garf-executors` libraries, it is **unknown if any mitigations are implemented within the codebase**. The descriptions of the vulnerability strongly suggest that mitigations are likely missing or insufficient.

#### Missing Mitigations
To effectively mitigate this SQL-like injection vulnerability, the following security measures are crucial:

- **Robust Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict input sanitization and validation for all user-provided SQL-like query components. This includes:
    - **Input Validation:** Ensure that queries conform to the expected SQL-like syntax, structure, and allowed keywords, functions, and operators. Implement whitelisting of allowed syntax elements.
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided values within the query to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or syntax before further processing.
- **Parameterized API Queries:**  Avoid direct string concatenation of user inputs into API query parameters. Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing API requests. This ensures that user-provided data is treated as data, not as executable code or query syntax. If the target APIs do not natively support parameterized queries, employ secure encoding and escaping mechanisms appropriate for the API's query format.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the API requests generated by `garf` adhere to the principle of least privilege. The framework should only request the minimum necessary data and operate with API credentials that have restricted permissions, limiting the potential impact of a successful injection attack.
- **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on the query parsing and API interaction logic within `garf-core` and `garf-executors`, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

#### Preconditions
The following preconditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploitable:

- **User Input of SQL-like Queries:** An attacker must be able to provide or influence the SQL-like queries processed by the `garf` framework. This could be through a user interface, API endpoint, configuration file, or any other mechanism that allows user-defined SQL-like queries.
- **Vulnerable `garf` Processing:** The `garf` framework must process these SQL-like queries and translate them into API requests without proper input sanitization or parameterized query generation.
- **Accessible Reporting API:**  There must be an accessible reporting API that `garf` interacts with, and this API must be vulnerable to manipulation via crafted requests derived from the SQL-like injection.

#### Source Code Analysis
**Due to the lack of provided source code, a detailed source code analysis is not possible.** However, based on the description of `garf`'s functionality, the vulnerability is hypothesized to reside in the modules responsible for:

1. **SQL-like Query Parsing:** The code that parses the user-provided SQL-like query string. Vulnerabilities can arise if this parser does not properly validate or sanitize the input, allowing malicious syntax to be interpreted.
2. **API Request Construction:** The code that translates the parsed SQL-like query into API requests. The critical point is how user-provided parts of the SQL-like query (e.g., fields, conditions, table names) are incorporated into the API request. If this is done through simple string concatenation without sanitization or parameterization, it creates a high risk of injection.

**Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Flow:**

```
User SQL-like Query Input --> [Garf SQL-like Query Parser (Vulnerable?)] --> Parsed Query Structure --> [API Request Constructor (Vulnerable String Concatenation?)] --> API Request --> Reporting API
                                                                                ^ Potential Injection Point
```

**Example of Potential Vulnerable Code Snippet (Python - Hypothetical):**

```python
def construct_api_request(sql_query):
    parsed_query = parse_sql_like_query(sql_query) # Hypothetical parsing function
    api_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/reports"
    api_query_params = {}
    if "fields" in parsed_query:
        api_query_params["fields"] = ",".join(parsed_query["fields"]) # POTENTIAL INJECTION: If fields are not validated
    if "filter" in parsed_query:
        api_query_params["filter"] = parsed_query["filter"] # HIGH INJECTION RISK: Direct inclusion of filter
    # ... other parameters based on parsed_query ...

    api_request_url = f"{api_endpoint}?{'&'.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in api_query_params.items()])}" # VULNERABLE: String formatting without sanitization
    return api_request_url
```

In this hypothetical example, if the `parse_sql_like_query` function does not sanitize or validate the `fields` and `filter` components extracted from the user-provided SQL-like query, an attacker could inject malicious API query parameters by crafting a specially designed SQL-like query.

A thorough source code review of `garf-core` and `garf-executors` is necessary to pinpoint the exact vulnerable code sections and confirm the vulnerability.

#### Security Test Case
To verify this SQL-like injection vulnerability, the following security test case can be performed:

1. **Setup:** Deploy a test instance of the `garf` framework connected to a mock reporting API. Ensure you have an interface or method to submit SQL-like queries to `garf`.
2. **Craft Malicious SQL-like Query:** Design a series of malicious SQL-like queries to test for different injection points and techniques. Examples include:
    - **Field Injection:** Attempt to access a sensitive field that should not be normally accessible.
      ```sql
      SELECT field1, field2, sensitive_field FROM report_table WHERE condition1;
      ```
    - **Table Injection (if applicable):** Attempt to access data from a different, unauthorized table.
      ```sql
      SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_table WHERE condition1 UNION SELECT secret_field1, secret_field2 FROM secret_report_table;
      ```
    - **Parameter Injection (e.g., through a `FILTER` clause):** Attempt to inject or manipulate API parameters, such as authentication keys or other control parameters, if the SQL-like syntax allows.
      ```sql
      SELECT field1 FROM report_data WHERE FILTER=api_key=malicious_value
      ```
    - **Condition Injection (e.g., bypassing filters):** Inject conditions to bypass intended filters.
      ```sql
      SELECT field1, field2 FROM report_table WHERE date = '2024-01-01' OR 1=1
      ```
3. **Execute Queries:** Submit each crafted malicious SQL-like query to the `garf` instance.
4. **Observe API Requests:** Intercept or log the actual HTTP API requests generated by `garf` and sent to the mock reporting API. Examine the URLs and request parameters for each query.
5. **Analyze API Responses:** Check the responses from the mock reporting API for each query.
6. **Verify Exploitation:**  Determine if the malicious queries resulted in any of the following:
    - **Unauthorized Data Access:** Retrieval of data that should not have been accessible based on intended query logic or access controls (e.g., data from `sensitive_field`, `secret_report_table`, or data bypassing filters).
    - **Unexpected API Behavior:** Errors or unusual responses from the API indicating that injected parameters or conditions are being processed.
    - **Injected Parameters in API Request:** Presence of injected malicious parameters or values in the API request URLs or bodies.

If any of these verifications are successful, it confirms the presence of the SQL-like injection vulnerability. A secure system should either reject the malicious query, sanitize it to prevent unintended access, or return only the data that the user is authorized to access based on the original intended query scope.
