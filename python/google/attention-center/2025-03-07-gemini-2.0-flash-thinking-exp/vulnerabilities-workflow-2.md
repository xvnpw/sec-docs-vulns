#### 1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Encoder Arguments
* Description:
  1. The `encode_with_centers.py` script is designed to encode images using the `cjxl` encoder, leveraging predicted attention centers.
  2. It allows users to pass additional arguments to the `cjxl` encoder through the command line, after a `--` separator.
  3. These user-provided arguments are extracted from `sys.argv` and directly passed to the `subprocess.run` function when executing the `cjxl` encoder command.
  4. The script constructs the command for `cjxl` by concatenating fixed flags, attention center flags, and these user-supplied arguments without any sanitization or validation.
  5. This lack of sanitization enables an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting malicious arguments as part of the additional encoder flags.
  6. When the `subprocess.run` executes the command, these injected commands are executed by the system, leading to command injection.
* Impact:
  - Arbitrary command execution on the system where `encode_with_centers.py` is executed.
  - Potential for complete system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, malware installation, and denial of service.
  - Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to perform any action that the user running the script is authorized to perform.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The script does not implement any sanitization, validation, or escaping of user-provided arguments before passing them to the `subprocess.run` function for executing the `cjxl` encoder.
* Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all user-provided arguments that are intended to be passed to the `cjxl` encoder. This should include escaping shell metacharacters or disallowing them entirely.
  - Parameterized Execution: Use parameterized queries or similar safe mechanisms to construct the command for `cjxl`, ensuring that user inputs are treated as data and not executable code. In the context of `subprocess.run`, this means carefully constructing the argument list and avoiding shell interpretation of arguments.
  - Principle of Least Privilege:  Advise users to run the script with the minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
  - Input Validation: Implement input validation to check if the provided arguments are in the expected format and value range, rejecting any unexpected or potentially malicious inputs.
* Preconditions:
  - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script. This could be through direct access to a system where the script is installed, or indirectly by exploiting a web application or service that uses this script.
  - The `cjxl` encoder binary must be installed and accessible to the `encode_with_centers.py` script in the expected location or as configured by the `--encoder` flag.
* Source Code Analysis:
  1. The `main` function in `encode_with_centers.py` retrieves additional encoder flags from the command line arguments using `additional_encoder_flags = argv_for_encoder[1:]`. These are arguments provided after the script name, and intended to be passed to `cjxl` after a `--` separator in command line usage as documented in README.md.
  2. The script constructs the command to execute `cjxl` using a list called `encoder_command`. This list is built by combining:
     - The path to the encoder binary: `encoder` (`_ENCODER.value`).
     - Fixed flags: `group_order_flag = ['--group_order', '1']`.
     - Attention center flags: `center_flags`, dynamically generated based on model prediction.
     - User-provided additional encoder flags: `*additional_encoder_flags`.
     - Input image filename: `filename`.
     - Output image filename: `encoded_image`.
  3. The `subprocess.run(encoder_command)` function is then called to execute the constructed command. Because `encoder_command` is a list, `subprocess.run` executes the command directly without invoking a shell (unless `shell=True` is used, which is not the case here). This prevents direct shell injection into `subprocess.run` itself.
  4. However, the vulnerability arises because the script blindly passes `additional_encoder_flags` to `cjxl`. If `cjxl` or the underlying system command parsing in `cjxl` interprets certain argument patterns as commands, or if `cjxl` itself has vulnerabilities related to argument parsing, then injecting malicious arguments becomes possible.  Specifically, arguments designed for shell command injection can be inserted within `additional_encoder_flags`.
  5. For example, if a user provides `-- --distance '1.0 ; touch injected.txt'`, the `encoder_command` list will contain  `['./libjxl/build/tools/cjxl', '--group_order', '1', '--center_x', '...', '--center_y', '...', '--distance', '1.0 ; touch injected.txt', 'input.jpg', 'output.jxl']`. When `subprocess.run` executes this command, it's possible that parts of the argument string `'1.0 ; touch injected.txt'` are interpreted by the shell or by `cjxl` in a way that leads to execution of `touch injected.txt`. Even though `subprocess.run` is used in list form, the arguments passed to `cjxl` might be later processed by a shell or by vulnerable argument parsing logic within `cjxl` itself. The vulnerability is in passing unsanitized user input as arguments to an external program executed by `subprocess.run`.
* Security Test Case:
  1. Prerequisites:
     - Ensure you have a working environment with Python, TensorFlow Lite, and the compiled `cjxl` encoder from the `libjxl` submodule, as described in the project's README.
     - Navigate to the root directory of the cloned `attention-center` repository.
     - Create a dummy JPEG image named `test.jpg` in the current directory. This image does not need to be valid JPEG for the command injection test itself, but it should exist so the script can proceed without image loading errors.
  2. Execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script with a command injection payload as an additional argument. Use the `--` separator to pass arguments to `cjxl`. In this example, we will attempt to create a file named `injected.txt` in the current directory:
     ```bash
     python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=. --output_dir=. -- --distance '1.0 ; touch injected.txt' test.jpg
     ```
  3. Verify the outcome:
     - After executing the command, check if a file named `injected.txt` has been created in the same directory where you ran the script.
  4. Expected Result:
     - If `injected.txt` is created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability. This indicates that the user-provided arguments are not being properly sanitized and are allowing the execution of arbitrary commands through the `cjxl` encoder invocation.

#### 2. Pillow Image Processing Vulnerability
* Description: A maliciously crafted image, when processed by the Pillow library in `encode_with_centers.py`, could exploit vulnerabilities within Pillow. This could occur during image opening (`PIL.Image.open`) or EXIF processing (`PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose`). Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the script.
* Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system. An attacker could gain full control of the system.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None within the provided code. The script relies on the security of the Pillow library.
* Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for image files before processing with Pillow. Keeping Pillow updated to the latest version. Running the script in a sandboxed environment.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script.
    - The script must process a maliciously crafted image provided by an attacker, placed in the directory specified by `--image_dir`.
    - The Pillow library must have a vulnerability that can be triggered by the crafted image.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. The script `encode_with_centers.py` imports the `PIL` (Pillow) library.
    2. In the `read_one_image` function, `PIL.Image.open(f)` is used to open the image file specified by `filename` from the input directory. This is a potential vulnerability point if Pillow has vulnerabilities in its image decoding routines.
    3. Immediately after opening, `PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose(image_pil)` is called to handle EXIF orientation. EXIF processing is another known area for Pillow vulnerabilities.
    4. `process_image` converts the PIL image to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(image_pil)`. This step might also be affected by Pillow vulnerabilities if the image data is already corrupted or malicious due to prior steps.
    5. If a crafted image is provided as input to `encode_with_centers.py`, and if this image triggers a vulnerability in `PIL.Image.open` or `PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose`, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Obtain a known malicious image file that exploits a vulnerability in Pillow. Publicly available resources like security vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases) or security research papers can be used to find such images or information to create one.
    2. Save the malicious image file to a directory accessible to the script, for example, create a directory `/tmp/malicious_images/` and place the malicious image inside (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_images/malicious.png`).
    3. Run the `encode_with_centers.py` script, providing the directory containing the malicious image as input using the `--image_dir` flag and an output directory using `--output_dir`. For example:
       ```shell
       python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=/tmp/malicious_images/ --output_dir=/tmp/output_images/
       ```
    4. Monitor the system for any signs of arbitrary code execution. This could include unexpected process creation, file modifications, network connections, crashes of the script, or other anomalous behavior. For example, attempt to create a file in a protected directory if possible within the Pillow exploit.
    5. If arbitrary code execution is observed, the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 3. Command Injection via Filename
* Description: The script uses the input image filename, obtained from the `--image_dir` argument, directly in the command executed by `subprocess.run` to call the `cjxl` encoder. If a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters is crafted and placed in the input directory, these metacharacters could be interpreted by the shell when `subprocess.run` is executed, leading to arbitrary command execution.
* Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the server. An attacker could potentially gain control of the system, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The script directly uses the filename in the command without any sanitization or escaping.
* Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization of filenames to remove or escape shell metacharacters before using them in subprocess commands. Using `shlex.quote` to properly quote the filename when constructing the shell command. Ideally, construct the command as a list and avoid shell interpretation altogether, although in this case, the encoder path and flags are also part of the command.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script.
    - The script must process an image file with a maliciously crafted filename, placed in the directory specified by `--image_dir`.
    - The system must be vulnerable to shell command injection when executing `subprocess.run` with user-controlled input in the command arguments.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. In the `main` function of `encode_with_centers.py`, the script iterates through files in the directory specified by `--image_dir`. The filename is obtained as `filename.name`.
    2. The script constructs the `encoder_command` list, which includes `filename` as an argument to the `cjxl` encoder. Specifically: `encoder_command = [encoder, *group_order_flag, *center_flags, *additional_encoder_flags, filename, encoded_image]`.
    3. The `subprocess.run(encoder_command)` function is then called to execute the `cjxl` encoder.
    4. If the `filename.name` (e.g., if a file is named ````test.jpg; touch /tmp/pwned` ```) contains shell metacharacters (like `;`, `$()`, `` ` ``), these could be interpreted by the shell, leading to the execution of unintended commands like `touch /tmp/pwned`. Even though `shell=True` is not explicitly set in `subprocess.run`, depending on the system's shell and how arguments are passed, command injection can still occur.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious image file with a filename containing shell metacharacters. For example, name a JPEG file  ```test.jpg;touch /tmp/pwned```.
    2. Save this file in a directory, for example, create a directory `/tmp/malicious_filenames/` and place the file inside: `/tmp/malicious_filenames/test.jpg;touch /tmp/pwned`.
    3. Run the `encode_with_centers.py` script, pointing `--image_dir` to the directory containing the malicious filename and `--output_dir` to an output directory. For example:
       ```shell
       python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=/tmp/malicious_filenames/ --output_dir=/tmp/output_images/
       ```
    4. After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
    5. If `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates that the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was executed as part of the filename processing, confirming the command injection vulnerability.
