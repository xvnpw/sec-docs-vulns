#### 1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Input to cjxl Encoder
* Description:
    1. The `encode_with_centers.py` script is designed to encode images using the `cjxl` encoder, leveraging predicted attention centers.
    2. The script uses `absl.flags` to parse command-line arguments, and it allows users to pass additional arguments directly to the `cjxl` encoder by using the `--` separator.
    3. In the `main` function, the script extracts these additional arguments from `argv_for_encoder[1:]` and stores them in the `additional_encoder_flags` variable.
    4. The script then constructs the command to execute `cjxl` by combining the encoder path, predefined flags (`--group_order`, `--center_x`, `--center_y`), the unsanitized `additional_encoder_flags`, input file path, and output file path.
    5. Finally, the script executes the constructed command using `subprocess.run(encoder_command)`.
    6. Because the `additional_encoder_flags` are passed directly to `subprocess.run` without any sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands. By crafting malicious arguments after the `--` separator, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the script.

* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or system where the `encode_with_centers.py` script is being run.
    - This can lead to a wide range of severe security breaches, including:
        - ** полный контроль над системой:** The attacker could gain complete control over the affected system.
        - **Data Breach:** Sensitive data could be stolen, modified, or deleted.
        - **System compromise:** The system could be used as a bot in a botnet, participate in further attacks, or be rendered unusable.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker might be able to escalate privileges depending on the context in which the script is executed.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script directly passes user-provided arguments to the shell command without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The script must sanitize or validate any arguments passed to the `cjxl` encoder, especially those provided by the user via the `--` flag.
    - **Argument Validation:** Implement a whitelist of allowed arguments for `cjxl` if possible, or carefully validate user-supplied arguments against expected values and formats.
    - **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, explore alternatives to `subprocess.run` that avoid direct shell command execution, or use safer methods for passing arguments to subprocesses that prevent command injection.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the script, including the `--` flag followed by malicious commands.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/encode_with_centers.py`
    ```python
    def main(argv_for_encoder):
        ...
        additional_encoder_flags = argv_for_encoder[1:]
        ...
        encoder_command = [encoder, *group_order_flag, *center_flags,
                           *additional_encoder_flags,
                           filename, encoded_image]
        ...
        if not _DRY_RUN.value:
            subprocess.run(encoder_command)
    ```
    - The code snippet above shows that `additional_encoder_flags`, which are directly derived from user input `argv_for_encoder[1:]` (arguments after `--`), are incorporated into `encoder_command` without any sanitization.
    - `subprocess.run(encoder_command)` then executes this command, making the system vulnerable to command injection.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization on `additional_encoder_flags` before executing the command.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Environment:** Ensure you have the `encode_with_centers.py` script, the `center.tflite` model, and a built `cjxl` encoder in the `./libjxl/build/tools/` directory as expected by the script, or adjust the `--encoder` flag accordingly. Also, prepare a test image in a directory, e.g., `./assets`.
    2. **Craft Malicious Command:** Construct a command line invocation of `encode_with_centers.py` that injects a malicious command. For example, to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp/` directory, use the following command:
        ```shell
        python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=./assets --output_dir=/tmp/out -- --version \; touch /tmp/pwned \;
        ```
        - `--lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite`: Specifies the path to the TFLite model.
        - `--image_dir=./assets`: Specifies the directory containing input images (you can use the provided `./assets` directory).
        - `--output_dir=/tmp/out`: Specifies the output directory (you can use `/tmp/out`).
        - `--`:  Indicates the start of arguments that will be passed directly to `cjxl`.
        - `--version \; touch /tmp/pwned \;`: This is the injected command. It first attempts to execute `cjxl --version` (benign), and then, crucially, it executes `touch /tmp/pwned`. The `;` characters are used to chain commands in a shell.
    3. **Execute the Script:** Run the crafted command in your terminal.
    4. **Verify Command Injection:** After the script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
        ```shell
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, this confirms that the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was successfully executed, demonstrating command injection vulnerability.
    5. **Expected Outcome:** The script should execute, and the file `/tmp/pwned` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory. The output in the console will likely show the executed `cjxl` command including the injected parts. This confirms the command injection vulnerability.
