### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Pillow Image Processing Vulnerability
  - Description: A maliciously crafted image, when processed by the Pillow library in `encode_with_centers.py`, could exploit vulnerabilities within Pillow. This could occur during image opening (`PIL.Image.open`) or EXIF processing (`PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose`). Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the script.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system. An attacker could gain full control of the system.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None within the provided code. The script relies on the security of the Pillow library.
  - Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for image files before processing with Pillow. Keeping Pillow updated to the latest version. Running the script in a sandboxed environment.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script.
    - The script must process a maliciously crafted image provided by an attacker, placed in the directory specified by `--image_dir`.
    - The Pillow library must have a vulnerability that can be triggered by the crafted image.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. The script `encode_with_centers.py` imports the `PIL` (Pillow) library.
    2. In the `read_one_image` function, `PIL.Image.open(f)` is used to open the image file specified by `filename` from the input directory. This is a potential vulnerability point if Pillow has vulnerabilities in its image decoding routines.
    3. Immediately after opening, `PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose(image_pil)` is called to handle EXIF orientation. EXIF processing is another known area for Pillow vulnerabilities.
    4. `process_image` converts the PIL image to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(image_pil)`. This step might also be affected by Pillow vulnerabilities if the image data is already corrupted or malicious due to prior steps.
    5. If a crafted image is provided as input to `encode_with_centers.py`, and if this image triggers a vulnerability in `PIL.Image.open` or `PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose`, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Obtain a known malicious image file that exploits a vulnerability in Pillow. Publicly available resources like security vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases) or security research papers can be used to find such images or information to create one.
    2. Save the malicious image file to a directory accessible to the script, for example, create a directory `/tmp/malicious_images/` and place the malicious image inside (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_images/malicious.png`).
    3. Run the `encode_with_centers.py` script, providing the directory containing the malicious image as input using the `--image_dir` flag and an output directory using `--output_dir`. For example:
       ```shell
       python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=/tmp/malicious_images/ --output_dir=/tmp/output_images/
       ```
    4. Monitor the system for any signs of arbitrary code execution. This could include unexpected process creation, file modifications, network connections, crashes of the script, or other anomalous behavior. For example, attempt to create a file in a protected directory if possible within the Pillow exploit.
    5. If arbitrary code execution is observed, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Filename
  - Description: The script uses the input image filename, obtained from the `--image_dir` argument, directly in the command executed by `subprocess.run` to call the `cjxl` encoder. If a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters is crafted and placed in the input directory, these metacharacters could be interpreted by the shell when `subprocess.run` is executed, leading to arbitrary command execution.
  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the server. An attacker could potentially gain control of the system, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The script directly uses the filename in the command without any sanitization or escaping.
  - Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization of filenames to remove or escape shell metacharacters before using them in subprocess commands. Using `shlex.quote` to properly quote the filename when constructing the shell command. Ideally, construct the command as a list and avoid shell interpretation altogether, although in this case, the encoder path and flags are also part of the command.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user must execute the `encode_with_centers.py` script.
    - The script must process an image file with a maliciously crafted filename, placed in the directory specified by `--image_dir`.
    - The system must be vulnerable to shell command injection when executing `subprocess.run` with user-controlled input in the command arguments.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. In the `main` function of `encode_with_centers.py`, the script iterates through files in the directory specified by `--image_dir`. The filename is obtained as `filename.name`.
    2. The script constructs the `encoder_command` list, which includes `filename` as an argument to the `cjxl` encoder. Specifically: `encoder_command = [encoder, *group_order_flag, *center_flags, *additional_encoder_flags, filename, encoded_image]`.
    3. The `subprocess.run(encoder_command)` function is then called to execute the `cjxl` encoder.
    4. If the `filename.name` (e.g., if a file is named ````test.jpg; touch /tmp/pwned` ```) contains shell metacharacters (like `;`, `$()`, `` ` ``), these could be interpreted by the shell, leading to the execution of unintended commands like `touch /tmp/pwned`. Even though `shell=True` is not explicitly set in `subprocess.run`, depending on the system's shell and how arguments are passed, command injection can still occur.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious image file with a filename containing shell metacharacters. For example, name a JPEG file  ```test.jpg;touch /tmp/pwned```.
    2. Save this file in a directory, for example, create a directory `/tmp/malicious_filenames/` and place the file inside: `/tmp/malicious_filenames/test.jpg;touch /tmp/pwned`.
    3. Run the `encode_with_centers.py` script, pointing `--image_dir` to the directory containing the malicious filename and `--output_dir` to an output directory. For example:
       ```shell
       python encode_with_centers.py --lite_model_file=./model/center.tflite --image_dir=/tmp/malicious_filenames/ --output_dir=/tmp/output_images/
       ```
    4. After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
    5. If `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates that the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was executed as part of the filename processing, confirming the command injection vulnerability.
