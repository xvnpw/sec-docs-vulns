- vulnerability name: Malicious Notebook Execution
- description: An attacker could modify the Colab notebooks provided in the repository to include malicious code. If a user is tricked into executing this modified notebook, the malicious code will be executed within the user's Colab environment. This can be achieved by the attacker sharing a link to their modified notebook or by other social engineering techniques.
- impact: Arbitrary code execution within the user's Colab environment. The impact depends on the permissions and resources accessible within that environment, but could include data theft, credential compromise, or further malicious actions.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: None. The project itself does not have implemented mitigations for this type of social engineering attack.
- missing mitigations: Add a clear warning in the README.md (and potentially in the Colab notebooks themselves) about the risks of running modified Colab notebooks and advise users to only execute notebooks from trusted sources, such as the official repository.
- preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to create a modified Colab notebook with malicious code.
  - The attacker needs to convince a user to execute the modified Colab notebook.
  - The user must have access to a Colab environment and execute the notebook.
- source code analysis: The vulnerability is not within the source code of the learned\_optimization library itself. The risk is introduced by the project's use of Colab notebooks and the way these notebooks are linked and promoted in the README.md file. The README.md provides direct links to Colab notebooks in the repository, which could be targets for attackers to modify and distribute malicious versions.
  - File: `/code/README.md`
  - The README.md file contains multiple links to Colab notebooks hosted on `colab.research.google.com` and pointing to files in the `google/learned_optimization` GitHub repository.
  - For example:
    - `1. Introduction : <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/learned_optimization/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Part1_Introduction.ipynb" target="_parent">`
  - These links, while pointing to legitimate notebooks in the official repository, can be modified by attackers to point to malicious notebooks in forked repositories or elsewhere.
- security test case:
  - vulnerability test: Malicious Notebook Execution Test
  - description: Test to verify that a modified Colab notebook can execute arbitrary code when a user is tricked into running it.
  - preconditions:
    - A test environment with Python and Jupyter/Colab notebook support.
    - Access to the learned\_optimization GitHub repository README.md file.
  - steps:
    1. Create a fork of the `google/learned_optimization` repository.
    2. In the forked repository, modify the `docs/notebooks/Part1_Introduction.ipynb` notebook to include malicious Python code within a cell. For example, add code that attempts to read a local file or prints a warning message indicating malicious execution.
    3. Create a link to the modified notebook in the forked repository, mimicking the structure of the original links in `README.md`.
    4. As a test user, open the original `README.md` and replace one of the legitimate Colab notebook links with the link to the modified notebook in the forked repository. Alternatively, simulate a scenario where the attacker directly provides the modified link to the test user.
    5. As the test user, click on the modified Colab notebook link and execute the notebook in a Colab environment.
    6. Observe the execution of the malicious code within the Colab environment, confirming the vulnerability. For example, verify the warning message is displayed or attempt to read a local file and confirm the action (or attempted action).
  - expected result: The malicious code embedded in the modified Colab notebook is successfully executed when the notebook is run in Colab, demonstrating the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
