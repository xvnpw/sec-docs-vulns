- Vulnerability name: Colab Notebook Code Injection
- Description:
  1. The project provides links to Colab notebooks in the README.md and potentially other markdown files within the repository.
  2. An attacker with write access to the repository (or through a successful merge of a malicious pull request) could modify these notebook files.
  3. The attacker injects malicious Python code into one or more of these notebooks.
  4. A user, intending to use the tutorial or example notebooks, clicks on a Colab link in the README or documentation.
  5. The user opens the modified notebook in their Colab environment.
  6. Unsuspecting users may execute the notebook cells without carefully reviewing the code, assuming it is safe because it's linked from the project's official repository.
  7. Upon execution, the injected malicious code runs within the user's Colab environment. This code could perform various malicious actions.
- Impact:
  - Compromise of the user's Colab environment.
  - Potential unauthorized access to data within the Colab environment, including files and credentials.
  - If the Colab environment is linked to the user's Google account, there is a risk of broader account compromise, including access to Google Drive, Gmail, and other Google services.
  - Execution of arbitrary code within the user's environment, leading to various malicious outcomes depending on the attacker's payload (e.g., data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, denial of service).
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations:
  - Add a clear and prominent security warning in the README.md and all markdown documentation that links to Colab notebooks. This warning should explicitly advise users to carefully review the code in Colab notebooks before executing them and inform them about the potential risks of executing untrusted code.
  - Consider removing or reducing the number of Colab notebook links in the repository to minimize the attack surface.
  - Explore options for verifying the integrity and security of the Colab notebooks. This might involve automated scanning, code review processes, or cryptographic signing of notebooks (though the latter is technically complex for Colab).
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs write access to the GitHub repository (either directly or by successfully merging a malicious pull request).
  - A user must click on a Colab notebook link provided in the project's documentation.
  - The user must execute the cells within the Colab notebook without carefully inspecting the code for malicious content.
- Source code analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not within the Python code of the library itself, but rather in the project's documentation files (specifically README.md and other markdown files) that provide links to external Colab notebooks.
  - Examine `/code/README.md` (and potentially other markdown files in `/code/docs/notebooks/` and `/code/learned_optimization/research/general_lopt/`) and identify the links to Colab notebooks.
  - The vulnerability arises because these links, if pointing to modified notebooks containing malicious code, can be leveraged to compromise users who execute them.
- Security test case:
  1. Fork the repository to gain write access to your own copy of the codebase.
  2. Navigate to `/code/docs/notebooks/` and modify `Part1_Introduction.ipynb` (or any other linked notebook).
  3. Insert malicious Python code into a cell within the notebook. For example, add code to print a warning message and attempt to access sensitive information in the Colab environment (for demonstration purposes only, avoid actual harmful actions).
  ```python
  import os
  print("WARNING: This notebook has been modified and may contain malicious code!")
  # Attempt to access environment variables or files as a proof of concept.
  print(os.environ.get("COLAB_GPU", "No GPU detected"))
  ```
  4. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.
  5. In the original repository's README.md, replace the link to `Part1_Introduction.ipynb` with the link to your modified notebook in your forked repository. Alternatively, directly use the "Open in Colab" badge link from your forked repository.
  6. As a test user, click on the modified Colab link (either from the modified README in your fork or if you managed to merge the malicious link into the original repo).
  7. In the Colab notebook, execute the cells, including the cell containing the malicious code.
  8. Observe the execution of the malicious code (in this test case, the warning message and the printed Colab environment information). This demonstrates the code injection vulnerability.
