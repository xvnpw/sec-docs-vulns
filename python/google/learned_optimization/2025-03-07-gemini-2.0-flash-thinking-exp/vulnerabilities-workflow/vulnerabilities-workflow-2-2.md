- Vulnerability name: Malicious Local Installation
- Description: An attacker could craft a malicious version of this repository. If a user is tricked into cloning and installing this malicious repository using the instructions provided in the README (specifically `pip install -e .`), arbitrary code within the malicious repository's `setup.py` or similar installation scripts could be executed on the user's machine. This is because `pip install -e .` executes code as part of the installation process.
- Impact: Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The project provides installation instructions that rely on `pip install -e .` without any security warnings or alternative installation methods.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Lack of security warnings in the README regarding the risks of running `pip install -e .` from untrusted sources.
    - Missing instructions or recommendations for verifying the integrity of the repository before installation (e.g., checking signatures or hashes).
    - Absence of a hardened installation process that minimizes or eliminates code execution during installation.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must be tricked into downloading and attempting to install a malicious version of the repository. This typically involves social engineering or supply chain attacks.
    - The user must follow the "Local Installation" instructions in the README and execute the command `pip install -e .` within the cloned malicious repository.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - The "Local Installation" section provides the command `pip install -e .` as the primary installation method.
    - File: `/code/setup.py`
        - The presence of `setup.py` (or similar files like `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`) in a Python project indicates that `pip install -e .` will execute code during installation. While the provided `setup.py` seems benign, a malicious version could contain harmful code.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious branch or fork of the repository.
    2. Modify the `setup.py` file in the malicious branch to include code that, when executed, will create a file named "VULNERABILITY_TRIGGERED.txt" in the user's home directory. For example:
    ```python
    # ... (rest of setup.py) ...
    os.system('touch ~/VULNERABILITY_TRIGGERED.txt')
    ```
    3. Host or distribute this malicious repository in a way that could trick users into downloading it instead of the legitimate repository (e.g., typosquatting, social media links).
    4. A victim user, intending to install the library, clones the malicious repository and navigates to the `/code` directory.
    5. The victim user executes the command `pip install -e .` as instructed in the README of the malicious repository.
    6. After successful execution (even if seemingly error-free), check the user's home directory for the presence of the "VULNERABILITY_TRIGGERED.txt" file. If the file exists, the vulnerability is confirmed, as it demonstrates arbitrary code execution during installation.
