- Vulnerabilities found:

  - Vulnerability name: Race Condition in Zarr Write Operations Leading to Data Corruption
    - Description:
        - The `ChunksToZarr` transform in `xarray_beam/_src/zarr.py` has a known race condition vulnerability when used without a pre-defined template.
        - Step 1: An attacker provides maliciously crafted input data to an application using Xarray-Beam that triggers the `ChunksToZarr` transform without a template argument.
        - Step 2: When `ChunksToZarr` is executed without a template, Xarray-Beam attempts to automatically discover the Zarr store structure by inspecting input chunks.
        - Step 3: Due to the race condition, concurrent write operations to the Zarr store metadata may occur, especially when dealing with many variables or large datasets.
        - Step 4: This race condition can lead to corrupted Zarr store metadata, resulting in silently incomplete or inconsistent data being written to the Zarr store. This means data integrity is compromised, and subsequent reads from the Zarr store might return incorrect or missing data.
        - Step 5: The vulnerability is more likely to be triggered in scenarios with high concurrency, such as when processing large datasets with many chunks or variables, or when using distributed Beam runners.
    - Impact:
        - Data Corruption: The primary impact is data corruption in the Zarr store. Data written might be incomplete, inconsistent, or missing, leading to incorrect analysis and results when the data is later read and used.
        - Data Integrity Violation: The vulnerability directly violates data integrity, as the stored data is no longer a faithful representation of the processed information.
        - Potential for further exploitation: In applications relying on the integrity of the processed data, this corruption can have cascading effects, leading to incorrect decisions or actions based on faulty data.
    - Vulnerability Rank: High
    - Currently implemented mitigations:
        - Warning Message: A `FutureWarning` is raised in `ChunksToZarr` in `xarray_beam/_src/zarr.py` when no template is provided, alerting users to the potential race condition and recommending the use of a template.
        - Code Comment: Comments in the code also mention the race condition and advise against using `ChunksToZarr` without a template, especially for large datasets with many variables.
    - Missing mitigations:
        - Deprecation and Removal of Template-less Mode: The template-less mode in `ChunksToZarr` should be deprecated and eventually removed to eliminate the race condition vulnerability entirely.
        - Enforce Template Usage:  Xarray-Beam should enforce the provision of a template for `ChunksToZarr` to ensure proper Zarr store setup and prevent race conditions.
        - Documentation Improvement: Enhance documentation to clearly explain the race condition vulnerability, strongly discourage template-less usage of `ChunksToZarr`, and emphasize the importance of providing a template for data integrity.
    - Preconditions:
        - Usage of `ChunksToZarr` without providing a template argument.
        - Concurrent write operations to the Zarr store, which is typical in distributed data processing pipelines.
        - Processing of datasets with multiple variables or large number of chunks increases the likelihood and severity of the race condition.

          ```python
          class ChunksToZarr(beam.PTransform):
              # ...
              def __init__(
                  self,
                  store: WritableStore,
                  template: Union[xarray.Dataset, beam.pvalue.AsSingleton, None] = None,
                  zarr_chunks: Optional[Mapping[str, int]] = None,
                  *,
                  num_threads: Optional[int] = None,
                  needs_setup: bool = True,
              ):
                  # ...
                  elif template is None:
                      if not needs_setup:
                          raise ValueError('setup required if template is not supplied')
                      warnings.warn(
                          'No template provided in xarray_beam.ChunksToZarr. This will '
                          'sometimes succeed, but can also result in writing silently '
                          'incomplete data due to a race condition! This option will be '
                          'removed in the future',
                          FutureWarning,
                          stacklevel=2,
                      )
                      # Setup happens later, in expand().
                  # ...
          ```
        - Analysis:
            - The code explicitly warns about a race condition when `template=None`.
            - When `template` is `None`, the Zarr store setup and metadata discovery are deferred to the `expand` method, which involves operations within the Beam pipeline itself.
            - This deferred setup, especially the automatic template discovery in `_DiscoverTemplate`, introduces a race condition. Multiple workers might concurrently attempt to write metadata to the Zarr store based on their input chunks, potentially leading to conflicts and data corruption.
            - The warning message clearly states the risk of "silently incomplete data", confirming the data integrity issue.
    - Security test case:
        - Step 1: Set up a Beam pipeline using DirectRunner or a distributed runner (like SparkRunner or DataflowRunner).
        - Step 2: Create a source Xarray dataset with multiple variables and chunk it.
        - Step 3: Use `xarray_beam.DatasetToChunks` to convert the dataset into keyed chunks.
        - Step 4: Apply `xarray_beam.ChunksToZarr` to write these chunks to a Zarr store, explicitly setting `template=None`.
        - Step 5: Run the pipeline.
        - Step 6: After the pipeline completes, open the Zarr store using `xarray.open_zarr`.
        - Step 7: Compare the written dataset with the original source dataset. Check for data inconsistencies, missing data, or corrupted metadata.
        - Step 8: Repeat the test multiple times, especially under concurrent execution scenarios (e.g., using a distributed runner with multiple workers) to increase the likelihood of triggering the race condition.
        - Expected Result: In some runs, especially with concurrency and larger datasets, the Zarr store will be corrupted, and the opened dataset will not be identical to the original source dataset, indicating data integrity vulnerability due to the race condition. The test should demonstrate that without a template, data corruption is possible.
