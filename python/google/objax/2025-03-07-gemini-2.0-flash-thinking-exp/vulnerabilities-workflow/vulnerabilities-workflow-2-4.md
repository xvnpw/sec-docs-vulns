- Vulnerability Name: Potential Supply Chain Attack via PyPI
- Description:
    - An attacker could create a malicious package on PyPI with a name similar to "objax", such as "objax-ml" or "objaax".
    - Users intending to install the legitimate Objax library might accidentally install the malicious package due to typos or confusion.
    - If a user executes `pip install objax-ml` or similar malicious package name, they would download and install the attacker's package instead of the legitimate Objax library.
    - Upon installation or import of the malicious package, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - Potential data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
    - Reputational damage to the Objax project if users associate the malicious package with the legitimate project.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident from the provided files. The project relies on users correctly typing the package name and trusting PyPI's infrastructure.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Typosquatting monitoring:** Implement monitoring for similar package names on PyPI to detect and report potential typosquatting attacks.
    - **Package name squatting:** Consider registering similar package names on PyPI to prevent attackers from using them.
    - **Clear installation instructions:** Emphasize the correct package name "objax" in documentation and installation guides to minimize user errors.
    - **Verification mechanisms:**  Provide mechanisms for users to verify the authenticity of the package, such as checksums or signatures.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to create a malicious package on PyPI.
    - Users need to make a mistake when typing `pip install objax` or be tricked into installing a malicious package.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/README.md`: This file contains the installation instructions recommending `pip install objax`. This instruction, while standard, opens the project to supply chain attacks if users are not careful.
    - No other files in the provided PROJECT FILES directly introduce this vulnerability, but the distribution method via PyPI and the lack of specific mitigation measures are the root cause.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a virtual environment.
        - Do not install the legitimate `objax` package.
    2. **Attack Simulation:**
        - As an attacker, create a malicious Python package. This package can be simple and just print a message or something more harmful. Name this package something similar to "objax", e.g., "objjax".
        - Upload this malicious package to PyPI.
    3. **Victim Action:**
        - As a user, mistakenly type `pip install objjax` (or fall for a typosquatting link) in the virtual environment.
        4. **Verification:**
        - Observe that the malicious package "objjax" is installed instead of the legitimate "objax".
        - If the malicious package contains harmful code in its `setup.py` or during import, verify that this code is executed in the virtual environment.
        - For example, if the malicious package contains `print("You have been hacked by objjax")` in its `__init__.py__`, verify that this message is printed when the user tries to import the package in Python after installation.
