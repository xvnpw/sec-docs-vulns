### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Inconsistent Segment Labels and Start Times leading to Incorrect Label Assignment
* Description:
    1. A malicious user crafts a TFRecord file where the number of segment start times and segment labels/scores are inconsistent within a SequenceExample.
    2. When `YT8MFrameFeatureReader.prepare_serialized_examples` parses this TFRecord, the code expects the lengths of `contexts["segment_start_times"].values`, `contexts["segment_labels"].values`, and `contexts["segment_scores"].values` to be consistent for proper label assignment.
    3. If a crafted TFRecord violates this assumption by having different lengths (e.g., more start times than labels), the `tf.stack` operation in line `label_indices = tf.stack([seg_idxs, contexts["segment_labels"].values], axis=-1)` or `tf.sparse.SparseTensor(label_indices, label_values, ...)` might encounter errors or, more critically, misalign segment labels with incorrect segments, leading to incorrect training or evaluation. Specifically, if `contexts["segment_start_times"]` has more values than `contexts["segment_labels"]` or `contexts["segment_scores"]`, the `seg_idxs` (indices from unique start times) will be paired with potentially shorter label/score lists, resulting in out-of-bounds access or incorrect label associations.
* Impact:
    - **Incorrect Model Training:** If this vulnerability is exploited during training, the model might learn incorrect associations between video segments and labels due to misaligned labels. This could degrade the model's performance and accuracy.
    - **Incorrect Evaluation Metrics:** During evaluation, misaligned labels could lead to inaccurate calculation of evaluation metrics such as mAP and GAP, providing a misleading assessment of the model's performance.
    - **Data Integrity Issue:** The processed data will be corrupted with incorrect label assignments, affecting the reliability of any downstream analysis or applications using this data.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code assumes consistency in the TFRecord format and does not explicitly validate the lengths of `segment_start_times`, `segment_labels`, and `segment_scores` within `YT8MFrameFeatureReader.prepare_serialized_examples`.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation checks within `YT8MFrameFeatureReader.prepare_serialized_examples` to ensure that the lengths of `segment_start_times`, `segment_labels`, and `segment_scores` are consistent. If inconsistencies are detected, the code should raise an error or log a warning and skip processing the problematic example to prevent incorrect label assignment.
    - **Robust Error Handling:** Add error handling around the `tf.stack` and `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` operations to gracefully handle cases where input data is malformed or inconsistent, preventing unexpected crashes and ensuring data processing robustness.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted TFRecord file to be processed by the training, evaluation, or inference scripts of the YouTube-8M starter code. This could be achieved by enticing a user to use a malicious dataset for training or evaluation.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/readers.py`
    2. **Class:** `YT8MFrameFeatureReader`
    3. **Function:** `prepare_serialized_examples`
    4. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    start_times = contexts["segment_start_times"].values
    uniq_start_times, seg_idxs = tf.unique(start_times, out_idx=tf.dtypes.int64)
    label_indices = tf.stack([seg_idxs, contexts["segment_labels"].values], axis=-1)
    label_values = contexts["segment_scores"].values
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(label_indices, label_values, (num_segment, self.num_classes))
    batch_labels = tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_labels, validate_indices=False)
    ```
    5. **Vulnerability Point:** The code directly uses `contexts["segment_start_times"].values`, `contexts["segment_labels"].values`, and `contexts["segment_scores"].values` without verifying if their lengths are consistent.
    6. **Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
        - The `prepare_serialized_examples` function is called to parse a SequenceExample from a TFRecord file.
        - The function extracts `segment_start_times`, `segment_labels`, and `segment_scores` from the context features.
        - `tf.unique` is applied to `segment_start_times` to get unique start times and their indices (`seg_idxs`).
        - `tf.stack` is used to combine `seg_idxs` and `contexts["segment_labels"].values` to create `label_indices`.
        - If the number of values in `contexts["segment_start_times"]` is greater than in `contexts["segment_labels"]`, the `seg_idxs` array, which is based on `segment_start_times`, will be longer than `contexts["segment_labels"].values`. When `tf.stack` is executed, it might lead to broadcasting issues or misaligned indexing when creating `label_indices`. Similarly, if `label_values` has a different length, `SparseTensor` creation will be problematic.
        - Even if `tf.stack` and `SparseTensor` don't throw immediate errors, the resulting `batch_labels` will likely have incorrect label assignments due to the misalignment, corrupting the data used for training or evaluation.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious TFRecord:** Create a malicious TFRecord file (e.g., `malicious.tfrecord`) containing a SequenceExample with inconsistent segment data. Specifically, create a SequenceExample where the `segment_start_times` context feature has more values than the `segment_labels` context feature. For example:
        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf

        def create_malicious_tfrecord(output_file):
            writer = tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)

            context_features = tf.train.Features(feature={
                "id": tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[b"malicious_video"])),
                "segment_start_times": tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[0, 5, 10])), # 3 start times
                "segment_labels": tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1, 2])),      # 2 labels (inconsistent length)
                "segment_scores": tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[0.9, 0.8])),   # 2 scores (inconsistent length)
            })

            sequence_example = tf.train.SequenceExample(
                context=context_features,
                feature_lists=tf.train.FeatureLists(feature_list={
                    "rgb": tf.train.FeatureList(feature=[]) # Empty frame features
                })
            )
            writer.write(sequence_example.SerializeToString())
            writer.close()

        create_malicious_tfrecord("malicious.tfrecord")
        ```
    2. **Run Evaluation Script:** Execute the `eval.py` script, pointing `--eval_data_pattern` to the `malicious.tfrecord` file and using a model configuration that utilizes `YT8MFrameFeatureReader` and segment labels (e.g., `FrameLevelLogisticModel` with `--segment_labels`). Assume the script is run locally.
        ```bash
        python eval.py --eval_data_pattern=malicious.tfrecord --train_dir=/tmp/yt8m_model --model=FrameLevelLogisticModel --frame_features --feature_names='rgb,audio' --feature_sizes='1024,128' --segment_labels --run_once=True
        ```
        (Note: You might need to create a dummy `train_dir` with model flags to avoid errors related to model loading, but the core vulnerability is in data loading, not model execution itself. Or modify eval.py to skip model loading for test purpose.)
    3. **Observe Error or Incorrect Output:**
        - **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** The evaluation script might run without crashing, but the labels will be incorrectly assigned to segments due to the inconsistent lengths in the malicious TFRecord. This could lead to unexpected evaluation metrics or potentially errors during later processing if the misalignment causes issues further down the pipeline.
        - **Improved Mitigation Test (after mitigation is implemented):** After implementing input validation in `YT8MFrameFeatureReader.prepare_serialized_examples` to check for consistent lengths and raise an error or skip the example when inconsistency is found, running the same test case should either:
            - Result in an error message indicating an invalid TFRecord format and prevent processing, or
            - Log a warning and skip the malicious example, continuing processing without misaligned labels.

This test case demonstrates how a maliciously crafted TFRecord with inconsistent segment data can be used to trigger the vulnerability and highlights the need for input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent incorrect model behavior.
