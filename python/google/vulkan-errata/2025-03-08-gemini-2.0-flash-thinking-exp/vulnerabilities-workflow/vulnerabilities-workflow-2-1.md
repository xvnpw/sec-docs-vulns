### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Public disclosure of Vulkan driver errata and workarounds
- Description:
  - The repository publicly documents known bugs in Vulkan drivers and provides detailed descriptions of how to trigger them, their side effects, and known workarounds.
  - An attacker can analyze this information to understand driver weaknesses and craft exploits against applications using Vulkan, potentially bypassing intended workarounds.
  - Step-by-step trigger:
    1. Access the public repository.
    2. Browse the `errata/` directory to find structured bug data in YAML format.
    3. Read the documentation in the `doc/` directory for detailed descriptions of each bug, including trigger conditions and workarounds.
    4. Analyze the bug descriptions and workarounds to identify potential exploitation strategies for vulnerable drivers.
    5. Develop exploits targeting applications that might be running on vulnerable drivers, potentially focusing on weaknesses in the documented workarounds.
- Impact:
  - By exploiting the disclosed vulnerabilities, attackers can cause rendering artifacts, crashes, or performance degradation in Vulkan applications.
  - They might also be able to gain unauthorized access or control over the system, depending on the nature of the underlying driver vulnerability and the application's security posture.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The repository is designed to be public and informative to aid Vulkan developers.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Consider making the repository accessible only to authorized Vulkan application developers or hardware vendors.
  - Implement a delay in public disclosure of new bugs to give driver vendors time to release fixes before the vulnerabilities become widely known.
- Preconditions:
  - Public access to the repository.
  - Target applications using Vulkan and potentially running on vulnerable drivers.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not in the source code of the project itself (scripts), but in the data it exposes, specifically the files in `errata/` and `doc/` directories.
  - By design, the repository aggregates and presents information about driver bugs and workarounds.
  - For example, `errata/flipped_present_region_rectangle_origin.yaml` and `doc/flipped_present_region_rectangle_origin.md` clearly describe a bug in handling present region rectangles on Android platforms.
  - An attacker can use this information to target Android applications using `VK_KHR_incremental_present` extension on vulnerable drivers.
  - Similarly, other files describe different bugs and affected drivers, creating a comprehensive attack surface map.
  - The `scripts/generate.py` script automates the process of making this information easily accessible in code and documentation.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step-by-step test for the vulnerability:
    1. Setup: As an attacker, gain public access to the Vulkan Driver Errata repository (e.g., through GitHub).
    2. Information Gathering: Browse the `errata/` and `doc/` directories to identify a bug that affects a widely used driver and platform (e.g., `flipped_present_region_rectangle_origin` on Android).
    3. Vulnerability Analysis: Study the description of the bug, its side effect, and the affected conditions. Understand the workaround, but focus on exploiting the bug itself.
    4. Exploit Development: Create a simple Vulkan application that triggers the `flipped_present_region_rectangle_origin` bug on an Android device with a vulnerable driver. The application should use `VK_KHR_incremental_present` and send damaged rectangles with top-left origin, expecting it to be interpreted as bottom-left by the vulnerable driver. Observe the incorrect rendering as a result of the flipped Y-axis.
    5. Verification: Confirm that the rendering is correct on devices with fixed drivers or when the workaround is applied. This demonstrates that the publicly documented bug can be easily triggered and exploited based on the information in the repository.
