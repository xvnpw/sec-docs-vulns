### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `open_zarr` function
- Description:
    1. A malicious user can call the `open_zarr` function and provide a crafted path as input.
    2. The `open_zarr` function uses `os.path.join` to construct paths to individual Zarr arrays within the provided base path.
    3. By providing a path containing path traversal sequences like `..`, an attacker can manipulate the resulting paths to point to locations outside the intended Zarr storage directory.
    4. When `tensorstore.open` is called with these manipulated paths, it may attempt to access and potentially read or write files outside the intended scope, depending on the TensorStore driver and permissions.
- Impact:
    - **High:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files or directories on the server's file system if the application using `xarray-tensorstore` runs with sufficient privileges and if the TensorStore driver allows access to arbitrary file paths based on the user-provided input. In a more severe scenario with write access enabled and misconfigured TensorStore setup, an attacker might be able to overwrite or create files in unintended locations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `os.path.join` without any validation or sanitization of the input path.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The `path` argument in `open_zarr` should be validated to prevent path traversal sequences.
    - Secure path handling: Instead of directly using `os.path.join` with user-provided input, the application should ensure that the final paths are within the intended Zarr storage directory. This could involve using functions like `os.path.abspath` and checking if the resolved path is still within the allowed base directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control the `path` argument passed to the `open_zarr` function. This is likely the case if the path is derived from user input or external configuration.
    - The server or application using `xarray-tensorstore` must have sufficient file system permissions to access files outside the intended Zarr storage if a path traversal attack is successful.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/xarray_tensorstore.py`
    - Function: `open_zarr(path, ...)`
    - Line: 219: `specs = {k: _zarr_spec_from_path(os.path.join(path, k)) for k in ds}`
    - Line: 231: `def _zarr_spec_from_path(path: str) -> ...:`
    - Line: 235: `kv_store = {'driver': _DEFAULT_STORAGE_DRIVER, 'path': path}`

    ```
    open_zarr
    └───os.path.join(path, k)  // path is user-controlled, k is dataset variable name, no sanitization
        └───_zarr_spec_from_path(path)
            └───kv_store = {'driver': _DEFAULT_STORAGE_DRIVER, 'path': path} // path is directly used in kv_store['path'] for tensorstore.open
                └───tensorstore.open(spec, ...) // tensorstore opens path from kv_store, potentially traversing directories
    ```

    The `open_zarr` function constructs the specification for TensorStore by joining the user-provided `path` with the name of each data variable (`k`) from the Zarr dataset using `os.path.join`. The `_zarr_spec_from_path` function then uses this potentially manipulated path directly as the 'path' in the kvstore specification for TensorStore, if the input path is not a URI. If a malicious user provides a `path` like `'../../sensitive_dir/zarr_root'`, the `os.path.join` will resolve paths like `'../../sensitive_dir/zarr_root/variable_name'`, which, when opened by TensorStore, could lead to accessing files outside the intended directory if TensorStore and the underlying storage driver (e.g., 'file' driver) do not prevent path traversal.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a temporary directory named `temp_dir`.
        - Inside `temp_dir`, create a subdirectory named `zarr_storage`.
        - Inside `zarr_storage`, create a dummy Zarr dataset (e.g., using `xarray` and `to_zarr`).
        - Outside `temp_dir`, create a sensitive file named `sensitive_file.txt` with some content (e.g., "This is a sensitive file.").
    2. **Attack:**
        - Construct a path that attempts to traverse out of the `zarr_storage` directory and access `sensitive_file.txt`. For example, if `zarr_storage` is located at `/tmp/temp_dir/zarr_storage`, the crafted path could be `'../../../sensitive_file.txt'` assuming the application is run from within or a subdirectory of `/tmp/temp_dir/zarr_storage`. A safer relative path would be `'../sensitive_file.txt'` if we assume the current working directory is `zarr_storage` when `open_zarr` is called, or `'zarr_storage/../sensitive_file.txt'` if the current working directory is `temp_dir`. For clarity and to ensure the test works regardless of the current working directory, it's best to use absolute paths if possible or relative paths from a known location within the test setup. Let's assume we can control the path relative to where `open_zarr` is called. If the application calls `open_zarr` with the base path of `zarr_storage`, we can use `'zarr_storage/../sensitive_file.txt'`.
        - Call `xarray_tensorstore.open_zarr()` with the crafted path, e.g., `crafted_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'zarr_storage', '../sensitive_file.txt')`.
        - Attempt to access data from the opened dataset (e.g., by trying to read a variable).
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the operation succeeds without raising a path traversal error from TensorStore or the operating system.
        - If successful, this indicates a potential path traversal vulnerability because the application might have attempted to access `sensitive_file.txt` instead of files within the intended `zarr_storage`. To definitively prove reading the sensitive file, we would need to modify the `xarray-tensorstore` code to log or report the actual file paths being accessed by TensorStore, which is beyond the scope of an external test case. However, a successful execution without errors using a path that clearly points outside the Zarr storage indicates a high likelihood of path traversal.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - Ideally, the `open_zarr` call should fail or be restricted to the intended `zarr_storage` directory. If it succeeds without any explicit error related to path traversal, it indicates a potential vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious path could be used to potentially access files outside the intended Zarr storage, highlighting the path traversal vulnerability in the `open_zarr` function.
