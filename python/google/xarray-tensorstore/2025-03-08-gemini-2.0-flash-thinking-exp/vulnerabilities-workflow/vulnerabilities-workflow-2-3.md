- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `open_zarr()` function
- Description:
    1. An attacker can control the `path` argument passed to the `open_zarr()` function in an application using the `xarray-tensorstore` library.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious path string that includes directory traversal sequences like `..`.
    3. When `open_zarr()` processes this path, it constructs a file path by joining the provided path with the names of data variables within the Zarr group using `os.path.join`.
    4. Due to the use of `os.path.join` without proper sanitization, the directory traversal sequences in the malicious path are interpreted, allowing the attacker to escape the intended Zarr storage directory.
    5. Consequently, the attacker can access or potentially manipulate files and directories outside the designated Zarr storage location, limited by the permissions of the user running the application.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could read sensitive files located on the server's filesystem if the application using `xarray-tensorstore` runs with sufficient permissions.
    - In more severe scenarios, if the application has write permissions and the attacker can craft paths to writable locations, they might be able to modify or delete arbitrary files on the system.
    - This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to data, data corruption, or even system compromise, depending on the context of the application and the server's file system structure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no explicit mitigations in the provided code to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. The code directly uses `os.path.join` with the user-provided path without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `path` argument in the `open_zarr()` function.
    - Implement path validation to ensure that the provided path is within the expected Zarr storage directory and does not contain directory traversal sequences.
    - Consider using secure path handling mechanisms that prevent path traversal, such as resolving paths to their canonical form and verifying they are within allowed directories.
- Preconditions:
    - An application that uses the `xarray-tensorstore` library.
    - The application must allow user-controlled input to be passed as the `path` argument to the `xarray_tensorstore.open_zarr()` function.
    - The application must be running on a system where the user under which the application runs has access to files outside of the intended Zarr storage directory.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `xarray_tensorstore.py`, the `open_zarr()` function is defined.
    - The function takes a `path` argument, which is intended to be the path to the Zarr group.
    - Inside `open_zarr()`, the `_zarr_spec_from_path()` function is called to generate a TensorStore spec.
    - `_zarr_spec_from_path()` function determines if the path is a URI or a local path. For local paths, it constructs a dictionary: `{'driver': _DEFAULT_STORAGE_DRIVER, 'path': path}`.
    - When opening individual arrays within the Zarr group, the code iterates through the data variables of the xarray Dataset (`for k in ds`) and constructs a full path using `os.path.join(path, k)`. Here, `path` is the user-provided input, and `k` is the name of the data variable.
    - `os.path.join` concatenates paths, and if the initial `path` contains `..`, it will navigate up the directory tree.
    - For example, if a user provides `path = "../../sensitive_data/zarr_root"` and the code iterates through variable names like 'var1', 'var2', then `os.path.join(path, k)` will result in paths like `../../sensitive_data/zarr_root/var1`, `../../sensitive_data/zarr_root/var2`, effectively accessing directories outside the intended 'zarr_root'.
    - The `tensorstore.open()` function then uses these constructed paths to open the underlying data. If the paths point outside the intended directory due to traversal sequences, the vulnerability is triggered.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a directory named `zarr_root` in a temporary location.
        - Inside `zarr_root`, create a dummy Zarr dataset using `xarray` and save it. This will represent the intended Zarr storage location.
        - Create another directory named `sensitive_data` in the *parent* directory of `zarr_root`.
        - Inside `sensitive_data`, create a dummy text file named `secret.txt` containing sensitive information.
    2. **Exploit:**
        - In a Python script, import `xarray_tensorstore` and `xarray`.
        - Construct a malicious path that attempts to traverse out of the `zarr_root` directory and access the `sensitive_data` directory. For example, if `zarr_root` is located at `/tmp/zarr_root`, the malicious path could be `malicious_path = "/tmp/../sensitive_data/zarr_root"`.
        - Call `xarray_tensorstore.open_zarr(malicious_path)` to open the Zarr dataset using the malicious path.
        - Access a variable from the opened dataset (e.g., `ds['foo']`). This will trigger the file access using the traversed path.
        - Attempt to read data from the accessed variable using `.compute()`.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the operation succeeds without errors. If it succeeds, it indicates that the path traversal was successful, and the library accessed files based on the malicious path.
        - Ideally, the test should attempt to read the `secret.txt` file indirectly (e.g., by creating a Zarr dataset that references a file path and then traversing to it) to definitively prove arbitrary file access, but even successful opening of a dataset with a traversed path is a strong indicator of the vulnerability.
        - In a real-world scenario, an attacker could further exploit this by crafting paths to read or write other sensitive files or directories based on the application's file system permissions.
