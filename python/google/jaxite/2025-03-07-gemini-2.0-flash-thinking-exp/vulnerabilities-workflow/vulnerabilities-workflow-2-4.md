#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Insecure Key Generation due to Weak Seed Usage

- Description:
    - The Jaxite library relies on user-provided seeds for random number generators to create cryptographic keys (LWE secret keys, RLWE secret keys, RGSW secret keys, bootstrapping keys, key switching keys).
    - The `README.md` file explicitly warns users about the importance of using cryptographically secure seeds in real applications, highlighting the example code's usage of `seed=1` as insecure and for demonstration purposes only.
    - If a user follows the example code directly or uses weak or predictable seeds (e.g., sequential numbers, timestamps, default seeds like `0` or `1`), an attacker can potentially predict the generated keys.
    - By predicting the keys, the attacker can decrypt ciphertexts encrypted with these keys, compromising the confidentiality of the homomorphic encryption scheme.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. A user implements Jaxite in their application and reuses the example code for key generation, failing to replace the insecure `seed=1` with a cryptographically secure seed.
        2. The user encrypts sensitive data using the generated client keys and performs homomorphic operations using the server keys.
        3. An attacker gains access to the ciphertext and the user's key generation code (e.g., through a public code repository or by social engineering).
        4. The attacker identifies the usage of the weak seed (e.g., `seed=1`).
        5. The attacker regenerates the same cryptographic keys using the weak seed.
        6. The attacker decrypts the ciphertext using the compromised client keys, gaining access to the sensitive data.

- Impact:
    - Critical: Complete compromise of the homomorphic encryption security.
    - An attacker can decrypt all data encrypted using keys derived from weak seeds.
    - Loss of confidentiality and potential data breach.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation in `README.md` warns against using insecure seeds and highlights the example usage of `seed=1` as insecure.
    - Example code comments in `README.md` explicitly advise using cryptographically secure seeds for real applications.
    - No code-level mitigation is implemented in the library itself to enforce secure seed generation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Enforce secure seed generation**: The library could provide utilities or guidelines for users to generate cryptographically secure seeds.
    - **Input validation and warnings**: The key generation functions could include checks or warnings if a potentially weak seed (e.g., within a certain range, or a default value) is used.
    - **Security focused documentation**: Create a dedicated security documentation section that emphasizes secure key generation practices, seed management, and potential risks of weak seeds.

- Preconditions:
    - User reuses example code or implements key generation with weak or predictable seeds.
    - Attacker gains knowledge of the weak seed or the key generation process.
    - Attacker obtains ciphertext encrypted with keys derived from the weak seed.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - The `README.md` file contains example code in the "Quick start" section demonstrating key generation:
        ```python
        lwe_rng = bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)
        rlwe_rng = bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)
        cks = jaxite_bool.ClientKeySet(
            params,
            lwe_rng=lwe_rng,
            rlwe_rng=rlwe_rng,
        )
        sks = jaxite_bool.ServerKeySet(
            cks,
            params,
            lwe_rng=lwe_rng,
            rlwe_rng=rlwe_rng,
            bootstrap_callback=None,
        )
        ```
        - The comment `# Note: In real applications, a cryptographically secure seed needs to be used.` is present directly above the key generation code, indicating a vulnerability if users ignore this warning.
    - File: `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/rgsw_test.py`, `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/blind_rotate_test.py`, `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/key_switch_test.py`, `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/lwe_test.py`, `/code/jaxite/jaxite_bool/jaxite_bool_test.py`, `/code/jaxite/jaxite_bool/pmap_test.py`
        - Test files consistently use fixed seeds like `seed=1`, `seed=0`, or `seed=2` for `random_source.PseudorandomSource` and `bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security`, `bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security`.
        - Example: `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/rgsw_test.py`
        ```python
        self.noise_free_rng = random_source.CycleRng(const_normal_noise=0)
        self.default_key = rgsw.gen_key(
            params=parameters.SchemeParameters(...),
            prg=self.noise_free_rng,
        )
        ```
        - Example: `/code/jaxite/jaxite_bool/jaxite_bool_test.py`
        ```python
        cls.lwe_rng = bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(1)
        cls.rlwe_rng = bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(1)
        ```
        - This demonstrates the usage of seeds in the library and highlights the risk if users apply similar insecure practices in production.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup:
        - Assume an attacker has access to a publicly available instance of a Jaxite project (e.g., a demo application or open-source project on GitHub).
        - The attacker inspects the key generation code and identifies that `seed=1` is used, mirroring the example in `README.md`.
    - Step 2: Key Regeneration:
        - The attacker uses the Jaxite library and the same parameters (security level, scheme parameters etc.) as used in the target project.
        - The attacker initializes the random number generators with the weak seed `seed=1`:
        ```python
        from jaxite.jaxite_bool import bool_params, jaxite_bool

        bool_params = jaxite_bool.bool_params
        lwe_rng = bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)
        rlwe_rng = bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)
        params = bool_params.get_params_for_128_bit_security()
        cks_attacker = jaxite_bool.ClientKeySet(
            params,
            lwe_rng=lwe_rng,
            rlwe_rng=rlwe_rng,
        )
        ```
    - Step 3: Ciphertext Acquisition:
        - The attacker obtains a ciphertext that was encrypted using the vulnerable key generation process. This could be done by intercepting network traffic, accessing a database, or other means depending on the application.
        - For simplicity, let's assume the attacker has a ciphertext `ct_sensitive` that encrypts the boolean value `True`, generated by the vulnerable user:
        ```python
        ct_sensitive = jaxite_bool.encrypt(True, client_key_set_vulnerable_user, lwe_rng_vulnerable_user) # Assume client_key_set_vulnerable_user was generated with seed=1
        ```
    - Step 4: Decryption:
        - The attacker uses the regenerated client key set (`cks_attacker`) to decrypt the acquired ciphertext `ct_sensitive`:
        ```python
        decrypted_value = jaxite_bool.decrypt(ct_sensitive, cks_attacker)
        print(f"Decrypted Value: {decrypted_value}")
        ```
    - Step 5: Verification:
        - The attacker verifies that the decrypted value is the original sensitive data (in this case, `True`). If decryption is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.
        - Running the decryption code will output `Decrypted Value: True`, demonstrating successful decryption using the weak seed-derived key.
