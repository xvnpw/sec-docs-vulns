- **Vulnerability Name:** Predictable Pseudorandom Number Generator in Test Cases
- **Description:**
    - The `CycleRng` class in `jaxite/jaxite_lib/random_source.py` is used in tests to generate deterministic random numbers.
    - `CycleRng` uses a hardcoded sequence of bits derived from `bin(13**39**2 // 53)[2:]` for its `uniform` method.
    - In tests like `jaxite/jaxite_lib/lwe_test.py` and `jaxite/jaxite_lib/rgsw_test.py`, `CycleRng` is used with `const_normal_noise=0` to create a `noise_free_rng`.
    - This `noise_free_rng` is then used for key generation and encryption in tests like `test_encrypt_decrypt_no_noise` in `rgsw_test.py` and `test_error_free_encrypt_decrypt` in `lwe_test.py`.
    - An attacker with access to the source code can predict the "random" numbers generated by `CycleRng` and potentially use this knowledge to break the security of the test examples.
    - While this is primarily a testing vulnerability, it could mislead developers into thinking that the cryptographic operations are secure when tested with deterministic, easily predictable "randomness". In a real-world scenario, if such a predictable RNG were mistakenly used in production code, it would lead to critical security flaws.
- **Impact:**
    - **Low (for production), Medium (for development/testing):** In the current context, this vulnerability is confined to test cases. It doesn't directly expose a vulnerability in production code because `CycleRng` is intended for testing purposes only. However, it can be misleading for developers and might hide potential issues that would be exposed with cryptographically secure RNGs. If developers were to inadvertently use `CycleRng` or a similar predictable RNG in production, the impact would be **Critical** as the system's security would be completely compromised due to predictable keys and ciphertexts.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `CycleRng` is implemented as a deterministic RNG for testing purposes.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **For Test Code:** While determinism is useful for tests, it should be clearly documented that `CycleRng` is **not** cryptographically secure and should **never** be used in production code. Tests should also ideally be run with both deterministic and cryptographically secure RNGs to ensure robustness.
    - **For Production Code:** It should be explicitly stated and enforced (e.g., via code reviews, linters) that only cryptographically secure RNGs (`SystemRandomSource`, `PseudorandomSource` with secure seed) should be used for key generation and encryption in production.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker has access to the source code of Jaxite and understands how `CycleRng` works.
    - Vulnerability is triggered when running tests or if `CycleRng` is mistakenly used outside of test context.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/random_source.py`
    - Class: `CycleRng`
    - Method: `uniform`

    ```python
    class CycleRng(RandomSource):
      """An RNG that cycles through a deterministic set of values."""

      def __init__(self, const_normal_noise: int = 0) -> None:
        self.const_normal_noise = const_normal_noise
        # This results in `uniform` having binary-valued outputs
        self.uniform_data = tuple(map(int, bin(13**39**2 // 53)[2:])) # Hardcoded deterministic sequence
        self.noise = iter(itertools.cycle(self.uniform_data))

      def uniform(
          self, shape: Sequence[int] = (1,), dtype: jnp.dtype = jnp.uint32
      ) -> jax.Array:
        return _shape_generator(lambda: next(self.noise), shape, dtype) # Predictable generator
    ```
    - The `uniform_data` is initialized with a fixed, pre-calculated tuple of integers.
    - The `uniform` method iterates through this fixed sequence, making the output completely predictable.
    - Test cases in `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/lwe_test.py` and `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/rgsw_test.py` use `CycleRng` as `noise_free_rng`.
    - Example from `rgsw_test.py`:
    ```python
    self.noise_free_rng = random_source.CycleRng(const_normal_noise=0)
    self.default_key = rgsw.gen_key(
        params=parameters.SchemeParameters(...),
        prg=self.noise_free_rng, # Using CycleRng for key generation in tests
    )
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Obtain the source code of Jaxite. Identify the `CycleRng` class in `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/random_source.py` and the test case `test_encrypt_decrypt_no_noise` in `/code/jaxite/jaxite_lib/rgsw_test.py`.
    2. **Predict Randomness:**  Calculate the first few outputs of `CycleRng().uniform()` to confirm its deterministic nature. For instance, run:
       ```python
       from jaxite.jaxite_lib import random_source
       rng = random_source.CycleRng()
       print([rng.uniform() for _ in range(5)])
       ```
       Observe that the output is always the same sequence.
    3. **Exploit Predictability in Test:**
       - Modify the `test_encrypt_decrypt_no_noise` test in `rgsw_test.py` to print the generated ciphertext and secret key (or parts of it).
       - Run the test.
       - In a separate script, reimplement `CycleRng` and regenerate the same "random" sequence.
       - Use the predicted secret key to attempt decryption of the captured ciphertext outside of the test environment, demonstrating successful decryption due to predictable RNG.

    ```python
    # Example modification in rgsw_test.py (for demonstration - not recommended for production)
    def test_encrypt_decrypt_no_noise(self, plaintext: int):
        ...
        ciphertext = rgsw.encrypt(
            rgsw_plaintext,
            self.default_key,
            decomposition_params=self.decomposition_params,
            prg=self.noise_free_rng,
        )
        print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}") # Capture ciphertext
        print(f"Secret Key Data: {self.default_key.key.data}") # Capture secret key
        pt_guess = rgsw.decrypt(...)
        ...
    ```
    4. **Expected Outcome:**  The attacker will be able to decrypt the ciphertext using the predicted secret key, proving that the "randomness" used in the test is predictable and insecure if used in a real-world setting.
