- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Key Generation due to Predictable Seed
- Description: The `README.md` example code for `jaxite_bool` demonstrates key generation using a fixed, predictable seed (`seed=1`). If developers copy and paste this example code directly into production systems without replacing the seed with a cryptographically secure random value, the encryption keys become predictable. An attacker who knows or discovers this seed can regenerate the same keys. This allows the attacker to decrypt any data encrypted using these keys, compromising the confidentiality of the encrypted information.
- Impact: Critical. Complete compromise of the homomorphic encryption. Attackers can decrypt all ciphertext generated using keys derived from the predictable seed, leading to complete data leakage.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `README.md` includes a comment within the example code: `# Note: In real applications, a cryptographically secure seed needs to be # used.`
    - This mitigation is insufficient as it is easily overlooked or ignored by developers.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Stronger Warnings in Documentation:**  The documentation, especially the Quick Start section in `README.md`, should prominently display a clear and strong warning, beyond a simple comment, against using predictable seeds in production. This warning should explicitly state the security risks and consequences of using weak seeds.
    - **Secure Key Generation Guidance:** The documentation should provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how to generate cryptographically secure seeds using appropriate methods available in Python (e.g., `secrets` module, `os.urandom`). Example code snippets demonstrating secure seed generation should be included.
    - **Discourage Seed Parameters in API:** Consider revising the API for key generation functions to reduce the likelihood of insecure seed usage. This could involve:
        - Removing the optional `seed` parameter from key generation functions altogether, forcing users to rely on system-provided randomness.
        - If a `seed` parameter is necessary for specific use cases (e.g., testing, reproducibility), rename it to something like `insecure_deterministic_seed_for_testing_only` to strongly discourage its use in production.
        - Adding runtime checks or warnings if a low-entropy or predictable seed is detected during key generation (though this might be complex to implement effectively).
    - **Security Best Practices Documentation:** Create a dedicated section in the documentation outlining security best practices for using Jaxite, with a strong emphasis on secure key management and random number generation.
- Preconditions:
    - Developers directly copy the example key generation code from the `README.md` or similar insecure examples into their production applications.
    - Developers fail to replace the placeholder `seed=1` with a cryptographically secure random seed.
    - An attacker gains knowledge of the seed value (which is trivial in this case as it's `1` and present in public documentation).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - The "Quick start" example for `jaxite_bool` demonstrates key generation using `bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)` and `bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)`.
        - The comment `# Note: In real applications, a cryptographically secure seed needs to be # used.` is present as a weak attempt to mitigate the risk, but is insufficient.
        - The example code encourages insecure practice by providing a direct, copy-pasteable code snippet with a known weak seed.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Deploy a vulnerable service using `jaxite_bool` for encryption.  Configure the service to use the key generation code directly from the `README.md` example, including `seed=1`.
        - Ensure the service encrypts some sensitive data using this setup.
    2. Attack:
        - Obtain a sample of ciphertext from the deployed service.
        - Locally, use the Jaxite library to regenerate the encryption keys by using the same insecure seed (`seed=1`) as used in the deployed service. Use the same functions: `bool_params.get_lwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)` and `bool_params.get_rlwe_rng_for_128_bit_security(seed=1)`.
        - Using the locally generated keys and the decryption functions of Jaxite (`jaxite_bool.decrypt`), attempt to decrypt the ciphertext obtained from the deployed service.
    3. Verification:
        - Successfully decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original sensitive plaintext. This confirms the vulnerability: predictable seed leads to compromised encryption.
