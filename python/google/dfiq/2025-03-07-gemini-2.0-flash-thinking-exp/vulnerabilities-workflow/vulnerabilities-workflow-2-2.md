- Vulnerability name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in YAML descriptions

- Description:
  1. An attacker with write access to the repository (e.g., through a compromised account or by submitting a malicious pull request that gets merged) can modify any of the YAML files (Scenario, Facet, Question, or Approach).
  2. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `description` field of a YAML file. For example, they could modify `/code/dfiq/data/scenarios/S1001.yaml` and change the description to:
  ```yaml
  description: >
    An employee is suspected of unauthorized copying of sensitive data.
    <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
  ```
  3. The project's website generation process reads the content from these YAML files and uses it to generate website pages, likely using a templating engine like Jinja2 and Markdown rendering (as suggested by `mkdocs.yml` and `generate_site_markdown.py`).
  4. The injected malicious JavaScript code in the `description` field is rendered on the website page without proper sanitization or output encoding.
  5. When a user visits the affected page on the DFIQ website (e.g., the scenario page for S1001), their web browser executes the malicious JavaScript code.

- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a page on the DFIQ website.
  - This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies, potentially compromising user accounts if the website has user authentication.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites, leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
    - Defacing the DFIQ website, damaging the project's reputation.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, if the website has authenticated features.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - Based on the provided project files, there are no visible mitigations implemented to prevent XSS in the rendering of YAML descriptions.
  - The project uses MkDocs for website generation and Markdown extensions, but there's no configuration or code snippet suggesting any input sanitization or output encoding is being applied to the content from the YAML files before rendering it in HTML.

- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: The project needs to sanitize user-provided content, specifically the `description` fields in YAML files, before rendering them on the website. This could involve using a library to remove or escape potentially malicious HTML tags and JavaScript code.
  - Contextual output encoding: When rendering the descriptions in the Jinja2 templates, or during the Markdown rendering process, output encoding should be applied to ensure that any HTML or JavaScript code is treated as plain text and not executed by the browser. Libraries like Jinja2 typically offer auto-escaping features that should be enabled and configured correctly for HTML contexts.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the YAML files in the repository. This could be achieved by:
    - Compromising a repository contributor's account with write access.
    - Submitting a malicious pull request that is reviewed insufficiently and merged by project maintainers.
  - The DFIQ website must be actively rendering content from the `description` fields of the YAML files directly to HTML pages without proper sanitization or output encoding.

- Source code analysis:
  - The project uses YAML files to store the forensic questions and scenarios. Files like `/code/dfiq/data/scenarios/S1001.yaml` contain `description` fields that are intended to be displayed on the website.
  - The `site` directory and `mkdocs.yml` configuration file indicate the use of MkDocs, a static site generator that uses Markdown.
  - The script `/code/dfiq/scripts/generate_site_markdown.py` is responsible for generating the markdown files for the website, likely from the YAML data. This script and associated templates are the entry points where the vulnerability is introduced if they do not sanitize or encode the YAML content properly.
  - The Jinja2 templating engine is used (see `DFIQ` class in `/code/dfiq/dfiq.py` and `generate_site_markdown.py`), which is used to render the final HTML pages. If the Jinja2 templates are not configured to auto-escape HTML by default, or if `safe` filters are misused, it will lead to XSS.
  - Reviewing the provided files, there is no code that explicitly sanitizes the `description` fields from the YAML files before they are processed by MkDocs and rendered on the website. The `mkdocs.yml` file only configures Markdown extensions, not security related sanitization. The python code `dfiq/dfiq.py` and `generate_site_markdown.py` focuses on reading and processing YAML files and generating markdown, but lacks any sanitization logic.

- Security test case:
  1. Clone the DFIQ repository locally if you have write access, or fork it if you plan to submit a pull request.
  2. Navigate to the scenarios data directory: `/code/dfiq/data/scenarios`.
  3. Open the file `S1001.yaml` in a text editor.
  4. Modify the `description` field by injecting a simple JavaScript alert. Replace the existing description with the following:
     ```yaml
     description: >
       An employee is suspected of unauthorized copying of sensitive data.
       <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test - Scenario S1001");</script>
     ```
  5. Save the changes to `S1001.yaml`.
  6. Commit your changes and push them to your repository branch.
  7. Access the DFIQ website in a web browser. Navigate to the scenario page for "Data Exfiltration," which corresponds to `S1001`. Assuming the website URL structure mirrors the file structure, this page would likely be accessible at `/scenarios/S1001/` or `/site/docs/scenarios/S1001.md` if the site is directly serving the markdown. Check the project's `mkdocs.yml` for the exact site URL structure if needed.
  8. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Test - Scenario S1001" appears when the page loads.
  9. If the alert box appears, it confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript code injected in the YAML description was executed by your browser, indicating that the website is not properly sanitizing or encoding the content from the YAML files.
