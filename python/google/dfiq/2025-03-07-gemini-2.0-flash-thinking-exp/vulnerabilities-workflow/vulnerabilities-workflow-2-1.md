- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in DFIQ Website Rendering
- Description:
    1. An attacker with write access to the DFIQ YAML data files (e.g., by submitting a pull request that is merged by maintainers) can inject malicious Markdown code into the `description` field of any DFIQ component (Scenario, Facet, Question, or Approach). For example, they could add an image tag with an `onerror` attribute containing malicious JavaScript code, or use a Markdown link with a `javascript:` URL.
    2. When the DFIQ website is generated using `dfiq/scripts/generate_site_markdown.py` script, the Jinja2 templates in the `templates` directory (not provided, but assumed to be used by `mkdocs.yml` and `dfiq.py`) process these YAML files to create Markdown documentation files in the `site/docs` directory.
    3. MkDocs, as configured by `site/mkdocs.yml`, then renders these Markdown files into HTML for the `dfiq.org` website.
    4. If the Jinja2 templates or MkDocs do not properly sanitize the Markdown content from the YAML `description` fields, the malicious JavaScript code injected in step 1 will be included in the generated HTML.
    5. When a user visits a page on `dfiq.org` that includes the DFIQ component with the malicious Markdown in its `description`, their web browser will execute the injected JavaScript code.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the DFIQ website.
    - This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        - Stealing user session cookies, allowing account hijacking.
        - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        - Defacing the DFIQ website for users.
        - Phishing attacks by displaying fake login prompts.
        - Potentially gaining further access to internal systems if users access the website from within a corporate network.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit code for sanitizing Markdown content from YAML files before rendering it into HTML. The project relies on default Markdown and MkDocs behavior, which might not be sufficient to prevent XSS, especially with complex Markdown features or extensions.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of all user-provided Markdown content, especially in the `description` fields of YAML files, before rendering it into HTML.
    - Consider using a security-focused Markdown rendering library that automatically escapes or removes potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the `dfiq.org` website to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially malicious content.
    - Regularly audit and update dependencies, including MkDocs and Markdown extensions, to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to have a way to modify the YAML data files, for example by contributing and getting a malicious pull request merged.
    2. The DFIQ website generation process must not include proper sanitization of Markdown content from YAML files.
    3. Users must visit the part of the DFIQ website that renders the malicious YAML content.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `dfiq/dfiq.py`: This file contains the core logic for parsing YAML files and creating DFIQ components. It reads the `description` field from YAML and stores it in the `Component` object without any sanitization.
    - `dfiq/scripts/generate_site_markdown.py`: This script uses Jinja2 templates to generate Markdown files from the DFIQ components. It passes the `description` content directly to the Jinja2 templates.
    - `site/mkdocs.yml`: This file configures MkDocs to build the website from Markdown files. It uses Markdown extensions like `pymdownx.betterem`, `admonition`, `pymdownx.details`, `pymdownx.tabbed`, `pymdownx.superfences`, `toc`, `def_list`, `attr_list`. These extensions, while adding features, might also increase the risk of XSS if not handled carefully during rendering.
    - Jinja2 Templates (not provided): It is assumed that the Jinja2 templates in the `templates` directory (e.g., `scenario.jinja2`, `question_with_approaches.jinja2`) are used to render the Markdown files. If these templates directly output the `description` content into Markdown without sanitization, then XSS is possible. For example, a template might contain `{{ component.description }}` which directly inserts the description into the Markdown output.
    - MkDocs Markdown Rendering: MkDocs uses a Markdown library (likely Python-Markdown) to render Markdown to HTML. If the Markdown input (generated from YAML descriptions) contains malicious code, and if the Markdown library or MkDocs configuration does not sanitize it, the resulting HTML will be vulnerable to XSS.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious YAML Data:**
        - Modify a YAML file (e.g., `/code/dfiq/data/scenarios/S1001.yaml`) and inject the following malicious Markdown code into the `description` field:

        ```yaml
        description: >
          This is a scenario description with a potential XSS vulnerability.
          <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')">
        ```

    2. **Generate Website:**
        - Run the script to generate the website Markdown files:

        ```bash
        cd /code
        python dfiq/scripts/generate_site_markdown.py
        ```

    3. **Build and Serve Website (using MkDocs):**
        - Navigate to the `site` directory:

        ```bash
        cd site
        ```

        - Run the MkDocs development server to serve the website locally:

        ```bash
        mkdocs serve
        ```

    4. **Access Vulnerable Page:**
        - Open a web browser and navigate to the page corresponding to the modified YAML file. For example, if you modified `S1001.yaml`, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/scenarios/S1001/` (the exact URL depends on MkDocs configuration and file structure).

    5. **Verify XSS:**
        - Check if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected!" appears in your browser when you load the page. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the XSS vulnerability is present because the injected JavaScript code from the `description` field was executed by the browser.
