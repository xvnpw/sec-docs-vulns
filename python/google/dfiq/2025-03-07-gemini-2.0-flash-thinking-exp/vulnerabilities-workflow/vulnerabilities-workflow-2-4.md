### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability via Unsanitized DFIQ YAML Data
* Description:
    1. An attacker modifies a DFIQ YAML file (e.g., a Question, Scenario, Facet, or Approach file).
    2. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a text field within the YAML file. For example, they could add `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` to the `description` field of a Question.
    3. The attacker submits a pull request to the DFIQ repository with the modified YAML file containing the malicious script.
    4. If the pull request is merged without proper review and sanitization of the YAML content, the malicious YAML file becomes part of the DFIQ data catalog.
    5. A web application, designed to display DFIQ data from these YAML files, fetches and displays the compromised data.
    6. When a user interacts with the web application and views the page displaying the compromised DFIQ data (e.g., viewing a Question with the malicious description), the injected JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.
    7. This execution occurs because the web application does not sanitize or encode the DFIQ data before rendering it in the HTML content of the web page.
* Impact:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can have severe impacts, including:
        - **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could steal session cookies or other authentication tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts within the web application.
        - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to extract sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session and send it to attacker-controlled servers.
        - **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware directly into the user's browser.
        - **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the web page, defacing the website and potentially damaging the reputation of the project.
        - **Redirection:** Users could be redirected to phishing sites or other malicious resources without their knowledge.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no specific mitigations implemented within the DFIQ project itself to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in web applications that might consume its data. The project focuses on being a data catalog and does not include code for a web application that would display this data. Therefore, the responsibility for sanitization lies entirely with the developers of any web application that utilizes DFIQ data.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The primary missing mitigation is the lack of input sanitization or output encoding within any hypothetical web application that displays DFIQ data.
        - **Output Encoding:** When displaying data from the YAML files in a web page, the web application must encode the data properly, especially text fields that could contain user-supplied content. This typically involves HTML entity encoding for display in HTML contexts to prevent browsers from interpreting malicious scripts.
        - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
* Preconditions:
    - A web application must be built to display DFIQ data from the YAML files.
    - This web application must fail to properly sanitize or encode the DFIQ data before displaying it in web pages.
    - An attacker must be able to inject malicious content into the DFIQ YAML data, for example by submitting a pull request that is merged into the project.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The DFIQ project itself is a data catalog and does not include a web application. Therefore, there is no source code within this project that is directly vulnerable to XSS.
    - The vulnerability arises from the *nature* of the data stored in the YAML files and how it *could be used* by external web applications.
    - **YAML Files as Data Source:** The YAML files (`.yaml` files in `/code/dfiq/data/`) contain various text fields intended for display, such as `name`, `description`, and `value` within approaches. These fields are defined as strings in the specification files (e.g., `/code/dfiq/utils/approach_spec.yaml`, `/code/dfiq/utils/question_spec.yaml`).
    - **Example: `/code/dfiq/data/questions/Q1001.yaml`**: This file and others contain `description` fields that are intended to be displayed to users. If a web application reads this `description` and renders it directly into HTML, it will be vulnerable to XSS if the description contains malicious JavaScript.

    name: What files were downloaded using a web browser?
    type: question
    description: >
      Downloading files via a web browser is a common way to introduce
      files to a computer. Determining what files were downloaded can be helpful
      in variety of scenarios, ranging from malware investigations to insider cases.
    id: Q1001
    dfiq_version: 1.1.0
    tags:
     - Web Browser
    parent_ids:
     - F1008
     - F1002
    ```
    - **Markdown Support in Descriptions:** The specification (`/code/site/docs/contributing/specification.md`) mentions that "Markdown syntax MAY be used for rich text representation." in `description` fields. While Markdown itself is not inherently vulnerable to XSS, if a web application parses Markdown and then renders the result without proper sanitization of the *underlying* HTML output, it could still be vulnerable.  If the Markdown parser itself has vulnerabilities or if custom Markdown extensions are used improperly, it could also introduce XSS risks. However, the primary risk is the lack of output encoding when displaying *any* text from the YAML, regardless of Markdown usage.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious YAML File:**
        - Modify an existing Question YAML file (e.g., `/code/dfiq/data/questions/Q1001.yaml`) or create a new one.
        - In the `description` field, inject the following XSS payload:
        ```yaml
        description: >
          This is a vulnerable description field. <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
        ```
        - Save the modified YAML file.

    2. **Simulate Web Application Display (Conceptual):**
        - Since there is no web application provided, we will describe how to *conceptually* test this if a web application were built.
        - Assume a simple web application reads the `description` field from the YAML file and displays it on a web page within a `<div>` element without any sanitization.
        - When a user accesses the page displaying this Question, the JavaScript code `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` within the `description` would be executed by the browser.
        - In a real test, you would set up a local web server, build a minimal web application that reads and displays the YAML data, and then navigate to the page in a web browser.

    3. **Verify XSS Execution:**
        - In a browser, navigate to the page in your hypothetical web application that displays the modified DFIQ Question.
        - If the web application is vulnerable, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" will pop up in the browser, demonstrating successful execution of the injected JavaScript code.
        - In a real-world scenario, an attacker could replace `alert("XSS Vulnerability");` with more malicious JavaScript code to perform actions like cookie theft or redirection.

This test case demonstrates the potential for XSS vulnerabilities if DFIQ data is displayed unsanitized in a web application. The core issue is not in the DFIQ data itself, but in how a consuming application handles and renders this data.
