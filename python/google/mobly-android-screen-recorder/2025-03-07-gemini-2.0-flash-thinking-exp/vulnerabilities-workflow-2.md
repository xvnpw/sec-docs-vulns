### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines a critical vulnerability identified in the Mobly Android Screen Recorder library, allowing for unauthorized screen recording of Android devices.

#### Vulnerability 1: Silent Screen Recording via Configuration Manipulation

* Description:
    An attacker can exploit the design of the Mobly Android Screen Recorder library to silently enable screen recording on an Android device without the user's explicit consent or knowledge. This is achieved by modifying Mobly test configurations or test scripts to include the registration of the screen recorder service. When a user unknowingly executes a test with these modifications, screen recording is activated in the background without any visible indication on the device itself. The recorded video, potentially containing sensitive information, is then saved in the test output directory, which the attacker might be able to access. This vulnerability can be triggered through various means, including social engineering, insider threats, or compromised systems where Mobly tests are executed.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker gains access to Mobly test configuration files (e.g., `sample_config.yml`) or test scripts (e.g., `hello_world_test.py`). This could be through local system access, compromised accounts, insider access, or social engineering.
    2. The attacker modifies a test script to register the screen recorder service within the `setup_class` method or similar setup section. This is typically done by adding the following lines:
       ```python
       from mobly.controllers.android_device_lib.services import screen_recorder
       self.dut.services.register('screen_recorder', screen_recorder.ScreenRecorder)
       ```
    3. The attacker tricks a user (e.g., a developer or tester) into executing the modified test script. This could be achieved by sharing the modified configuration and script disguised as legitimate files, embedding it within a larger test suite, or through other social engineering tactics.
    4. The user, unaware of the added screen recording functionality, executes the modified test script using Mobly.
    5. The `ScreenRecorder` service starts automatically when the test begins, initiating screen recording on the connected Android device. This happens in the background without any explicit consent prompt or visible indication on the device originating from the `mobly-android-screen-recorder` library itself.
    6. The screen recording continues throughout the test execution.
    7. The recorded video file is saved in the test output directory on the system running the Mobly test.
    8. The attacker can then access the test output directory and potentially exfiltrate the recorded video file, which may contain sensitive information displayed on the Android device screen during the test.

* Impact:
    This vulnerability poses a significant threat to user privacy and data confidentiality.

    *   **Privacy Breach & Violation:** Sensitive information displayed on the Android device screen, such as personal messages, emails, credentials, application data, financial details, or other confidential content, can be secretly recorded and accessed without the user's knowledge or consent. This is a severe privacy violation with potential legal and ethical repercussions.
    *   **Unauthorized Surveillance:** The vulnerability allows for unauthorized surveillance of Android device users. Attackers can monitor user activities and gather intelligence without detection.
    *   **Data Theft & Exfiltration:** Recorded video files can be easily exfiltrated from the test environment by the attacker, leading to unauthorized access and potential misuse of sensitive data. This can result in data breaches and further compromise.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** If the misuse of this tool for unauthorized screen recording becomes public, it could severely damage the reputation of the project, its developers, and any organization using it.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The current mitigations are limited to documentation-based warnings and guidelines, which are not technical controls and rely on user awareness and responsible behavior.

    *   **Disclaimer and Responsible Use guidelines in `README.md`:** The `README.md` file includes a "Responsible Use" section and a "Privacy Warning" that strongly emphasize the need for explicit consent, legitimate purpose, data security, and transparency when using the screen recording feature. It warns against misuse for unauthorized surveillance and highlights the ethical and legal implications.
        *   File: `/code/README.md`
        *   Sections: "Responsible Use" and "Disclaimer"
    *   **Code of Conduct:** The project has a Code of Conduct that promotes ethical behavior and discourages inappropriate conduct.

* Missing Mitigations:
    Several technical mitigations are missing to effectively address this vulnerability and prevent unauthorized screen recording.

    *   **Visual indication on the Android device**: Implement a visible indicator on the Android device screen whenever screen recording is active. This could be an icon in the status bar, a persistent notification, or a toast message displayed at the start and end of recording. This would immediately alert the user that screen recording is in progress, regardless of how it was initiated.
    *   **Explicit Consent Mechanism within the Tool:** The library lacks any built-in mechanism to enforce or verify user consent before initiating screen recording. Implement a consent mechanism within the tool itself. This could involve:
        *   **Consent Prompt:** Display a clear consent dialog or prompt on the Android device before screen recording starts, requiring explicit user confirmation.
        *   **Configuration-based enabling with confirmation:** Introduce a configuration setting (e.g., in the Mobly test configuration file) that explicitly enables the screen recording service, but require user confirmation on the device when enabled through configuration.
        *   **Permission-based registration:** Implement a permission check or request before allowing service registration. This could be integrated with a user authentication or authorization system within the Mobly environment (if available).
    *   **Auditing and Logging of screen recording activities**: Implement comprehensive logging of screen recording start and stop events, including timestamps, the user or process that initiated the recording, and potentially the reason for recording. This would provide an audit trail for screen recording activities, making it easier to detect and investigate potential misuse.
    *   **Access Control for Service Registration:** Implement a mechanism to control or restrict the registration of the `screen_recorder` service, preventing arbitrary enabling through test script modification. This could involve:
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limit service registration to users with specific roles or permissions within the Mobly testing environment.
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Protect test configuration files and scripts from unauthorized modification through appropriate access controls and versioning.
    *   **Secure Storage of Recordings:** Ensure that test output directories, where recordings are stored, have appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access and exfiltration of recorded video files. Implement secure file permissions and consider encryption for sensitive recordings.

* Preconditions:
    Specific conditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploited.

    *   **Attacker Access:** The attacker needs to gain the ability to modify Mobly test configuration files or test scripts. This can be achieved through:
        *   Local system access to the machine where Mobly tests are executed.
        *   Compromised user accounts or insider access to the testing environment.
        *   Social engineering tactics to trick users into running modified scripts.
    *   **User Execution:** A user must execute the modified Mobly test configuration or script on their testing environment.
    *   **Mobly Environment Setup:** A functional Mobly testing environment must be set up, including:
        *   Mobly framework installed and configured.
        *   `mobly-android-screen-recorder` library installed.
        *   Target Android device connected and configured for Mobly testing via ADB with authorized ADB access.

* Source Code Analysis:
    The vulnerability stems from the design and implementation of the `ScreenRecorder` service within the `mobly-android-screen-recorder` library, specifically in the file `/code/mobly/controllers/android_device_lib/services/screen_recorder.py`.

    1.  **Service Registration and Activation:**
        *   The `ScreenRecorder` class is implemented as a Mobly service.
        *   The `start()` method in `screen_recorder.py` is responsible for initializing and starting the screen recording process. It handles pushing the `scrcpy-server.apk` to the device, setting up port forwarding, starting the `scrcpy-server` on the Android device, and establishing a socket connection to stream video frames.
        *   The service is registered and activated programmatically within Mobly test scripts using the `self.dut.services.register()` method, as demonstrated in the `README.md` and example test scripts like `hello_world_test.py`:
            ```python
            self.dut.services.register('screen_recorder', screen_recorder.ScreenRecorder)
            ```
        *   This registration mechanism is the core of the vulnerability. It lacks any built-in access control, authorization, or consent verification. Anyone who can modify the test script can add this line and enable screen recording without further checks.

    2.  **Absence of Consent Enforcement:**
        *   A thorough review of the `screen_recorder.py` code reveals a complete absence of any consent mechanism. There is no code to:
            *   Prompt for user consent on the Android device.
            *   Display any notification or warning about screen recording on the device.
            *   Check for pre-existing user consent or permissions related to screen capture.
            *   Log or record user consent.
        *   The service is designed to start recording automatically once the `start()` method is called, which is triggered as part of the Mobly test lifecycle after service registration. There is no step that requires explicit user interaction or authorization before recording begins.

    3.  **Default Output Path and Storage:**
        *   The recorded video files are saved in the default Mobly test output directory, which is typically accessible to users with local system access.
        *   The `ScreenRecorder` service determines the output directory using the Mobly configuration:
            ```python
            self.output_dir = configs.output_dir or device.log_path
            ```
            (File: `/code/mobly/controllers/android_device_lib/services/screen_recorder.py`, Lines 164-165)
        *   The video file is created and saved without any specific access controls beyond the standard file system permissions of the test output directory.
            ```python
            cv2.VideoWriter(os.path.join(self.output_dir, filename), ...)
            ```
            (File: `/code/mobly/controllers/android_device_lib/services/screen_recorder.py`, Lines 604-611)
        *   This default behavior, combined with the lack of access control on service registration, makes it straightforward for an attacker to record and retrieve screen captures if they can modify test scripts and access the output directory.

    4.  **No User Notification or Indication:**
        *   The code does not include any functionality to display a notification, icon, or sound on the Android device to indicate that screen recording is active.
        *   The recording process is designed to be transparent to the device user from the perspective of the `mobly-android-screen-recorder` library itself. While `scrcpy-server` might have its own notification mechanisms depending on the Android version and device, the Mobly service does not actively manage or utilize these for user notification.

* Security Test Case:
    This security test case demonstrates how an attacker can silently enable screen recording and capture video without user consent.

    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Configure a Mobly testing environment with a connected Android device.
        *   Ensure the `mobly-android-screen-recorder` library is installed.
        *   Create a Mobly test configuration file (e.g., `test_config.yml`):
            ```yaml
            TestBeds:
              - Name: SilentRecordTestBed
                Controllers:
                    AndroidDevice: '*'
            ```
    2.  **Baseline Test Script (No Recording):**
        *   Create a Mobly test script (`no_record_test.py`) that does not include screen recording service registration:
            ```python
            from mobly import base_test
            from mobly import test_runner
            from mobly.controllers import android_device

            class NoRecordTest(base_test.BaseTestClass):
              def setup_class(self):
                self.ads = self.register_controller(android_device)
                self.dut = self.ads[0]
                self.dut.load_snippet('mbs', android_device.MBS_PACKAGE)

              def test_no_record(self):
                self.dut.mbs.makeToast('Hello World - No Record Test!')

              def teardown_test(self):
                self.dut.services.create_output_excerpts_all(self.current_test_info)

            if __name__ == '__main__':
              test_runner.main()
            ```
    3.  **Run Baseline Test:**
        *   Execute the `no_record_test.py` with the configuration file:
            ```bash
            python no_record_test.py -c test_config.yml
            ```
        *   **Verify No Recording:** Check the test output directory. Confirm that no video file (e.g., `video_...mp4`) has been generated. Observe the Android device screen; there should be no indication of screen recording.
    4.  **Modified Test Script (With Recording):**
        *   Create a modified test script (`record_test.py`) that includes the screen recorder service registration in the `setup_class` method:
            ```python
            from mobly import base_test
            from mobly import test_runner
            from mobly.controllers import android_device
            from mobly.controllers.android_device_lib.services import screen_recorder

            class RecordTest(base_test.BaseTestClass):
              def setup_class(self):
                self.ads = self.register_controller(android_device)
                self.dut = self.ads[0]
                self.dut.load_snippet('mbs', android_device.MBS_PACKAGE)
                self.dut.services.register('screen_recorder', screen_recorder.ScreenRecorder) # Added line

              def test_record(self):
                self.dut.mbs.makeToast('Hello World - Record Test!')

              def teardown_test(self):
                self.dut.services.create_output_excerpts_all(self.current_test_info)

            if __name__ == '__main__':
              test_runner.main()
            ```
    5.  **Run Modified Test (Silently):**
        *   Execute the `record_test.py` with the same configuration file, without informing the user about the screen recording:
            ```bash
            python record_test.py -c test_config.yml
            ```
    6.  **Verify Recording Enabled Silently:**
        *   Check the test output directory after execution. Confirm that a video file (e.g., `video_...mp4`) has been generated. This proves screen recording was enabled.
        *   Observe the Android device screen during the execution of `record_test.py`. Verify that there is **no visible indication on the device** (no icon, no notification, no toast originating from `mobly-android-screen-recorder`) that screen recording was active.

    **Expected Result:** The test case successfully demonstrates that by modifying the test script to include the service registration, screen recording is silently activated, and a video file is generated without any explicit user consent or device-side indication from the library itself. This confirms the vulnerability of silent screen recording via configuration manipulation.
