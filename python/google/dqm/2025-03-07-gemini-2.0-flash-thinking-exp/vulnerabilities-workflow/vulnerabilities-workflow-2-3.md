## Vulnerability List for Data Quality Manager (DQM)

### 1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Check Comments

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the DQM application can create or edit a Data Quality Check.
    2.  In the "comments" field of the Check definition, the attacker injects malicious Javascript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3.  The application stores this malicious comment in the database without proper sanitization or encoding.
    4.  When another user views the Check definition or any page displaying this comment (e.g., in the suite or check details view in the frontend), the malicious Javascript code is executed in their browser.
    5.  This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or further malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or credentials of other users who view the malicious comment.
    *   Data Theft: The attacker could use Javascript to extract sensitive data displayed on the page and send it to a remote server.
    *   Malware Distribution: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
    *   Defacement: The attacker could alter the visual appearance of the application for other users.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None observed in the provided code. The application stores and retrieves the "comments" field without any explicit sanitization or encoding.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization: Sanitize user input in the "comments" field on the backend before storing it in the database. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template escaping or a dedicated HTML sanitization library.
    *   Output encoding: Encode the "comments" field when rendering it in the frontend to prevent the browser from interpreting injected HTML or Javascript code. VueJS should be configured to use template escaping by default, but it needs to be verified and ensured for all outputs of user-provided content.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, which can limit the impact of XSS attacks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker needs to have user access to the DQM application to create or edit checks. This could be any authenticated user, depending on the application's user roles and permissions (which are not defined in provided files).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   File: `/code/backend/dqm/models.py`
        ```python
        class Check(models.Model):
            ...
            comments = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
            ...
        ```
        The `comments` field in the `Check` model is a `TextField`, which can store arbitrary text input. There is no indication of sanitization happening at the model level.

    *   File: `/code/backend/dqm/api/views.py`
        ```python
        @csrf_exempt
        @require_http_methods(['PUT'])
        def update_check(request, suite_id, check_id):
          payload = json.loads(request.body)
          payload['params_json'] = json.dumps(payload.pop('paramValues'))
          try:
            del payload['resultFields']
          except:
            pass
          try:
            del payload['checkMetadata']
          except:
            pass
          Check.objects.filter(id=check_id).update(**payload)
          return JsonResponse({'check': None}, encoder=DqmApiEncoder)
        ```
        The `update_check` view directly updates the `Check` model with the provided payload without any sanitization of the `comments` field or other text-based fields.

    *   Frontend code is not provided, but assuming the frontend displays the `comments` field from the API response, it's likely vulnerable if no output encoding is implemented there.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Log in to the DQM application as an attacker user.
    2.  Navigate to the "Suites" or "Checks" section.
    3.  Create a new Data Quality Check or edit an existing one.
    4.  In the "comments" field, enter the following malicious payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-comments-field')>`.
    5.  Save the Check.
    6.  Log out and log in as a different user, or simply refresh the page as the same user and navigate to the check details or suite view where the comment is displayed.
    7.  Observe if an alert box with "XSS-comments-field" is displayed. If the alert box appears, the Stored XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

### 2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Suite Names

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the DQM application can create or edit a Suite.
    2.  In the "name" field of the Suite definition, the attacker injects malicious Javascript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-suite-name')>`.
    3.  The application stores this malicious name in the database without proper sanitization or encoding.
    4.  When another user views the Suite definition or any page displaying this suite name (e.g., in the suites list, suite details view in the frontend), the malicious Javascript code is executed in their browser.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Similar to XSS in Check Comments: Account Takeover, Data Theft, Malware Distribution, Defacement.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium (slightly lower than comments as suite names might be displayed less frequently than check comments)

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None observed in the provided code.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization for the "name" field in the `Suite` model.
    *   Output encoding for the "name" field when displayed in the frontend.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP).

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker needs to have user access to the DQM application to create or edit suites.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   File: `/code/backend/dqm/models.py`
        ```python
        class Suite(models.Model):
          name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
          ...
        ```
        The `name` field in the `Suite` model is a `CharField`, which can store text input. No sanitization is indicated here.

    *   File: `/code/backend/dqm/api/views.py`
        ```python
        def create_suite(request):
          payload = json.loads(request.body)
          suite = Suite.objects.create(name=payload['name'])
          GaParams.objects.create(suite=suite, scope_json='')
          ...

        def update_suite(request, suite_id):
          payload = json.loads(request.body)
          s = get_object_or_404(Suite, pk=suite_id)
          ...
          if 'name' in payload: # Name is not updated in provided code snippet, but assuming it's part of full implementation
              s.name = payload['name']
              s.save()
          ...
        ```
        The `create_suite` and (assumed) `update_suite` views directly use the `name` from the payload to create/update the `Suite` object without sanitization.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Log in to the DQM application as an attacker user.
    2.  Navigate to the "Suites" section.
    3.  Create a new Suite or edit an existing one.
    4.  In the "name" field, enter the following malicious payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-suite-name-field')>`.
    5.  Save the Suite.
    6.  Log out and log in as a different user, or simply refresh the page and navigate to the suites list or suite details view where the suite name is displayed.
    7.  Observe if an alert box with "XSS-suite-name-field" is displayed. If the alert box appears, the Stored XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
