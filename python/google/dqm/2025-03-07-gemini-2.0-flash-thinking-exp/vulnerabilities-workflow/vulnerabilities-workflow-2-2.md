### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Authentication Bypass

* Description:
    1. An attacker accesses the publicly deployed DQM application without proper authentication.
    2. The attacker bypasses the expected GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) mechanism, for example by directly accessing the App Engine application URL if IAP is not correctly configured or disabled.
    3. Since the Django backend application lacks any built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms, the attacker gains full, unauthorized access to all API endpoints.
    4. The attacker can now perform any actions exposed by the API, including viewing, creating, modifying, and deleting data quality checks, suites, and related configurations.
    5. This unauthorized access allows the attacker to potentially exfiltrate sensitive advertising data, manipulate data quality checks, or disrupt the application's functionality.

* Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to the entire DQM application and its data.
    - Exposure of sensitive advertising data, including data quality checks and configurations.
    - Ability to manipulate or delete data quality checks, leading to incorrect data quality assessments.
    - Potential disruption of the data quality management process in online advertising.
    - Complete compromise of the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project documentation in `README.md` recommends enabling GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for access restriction.
    - The `installer.py` script guides users to deploy on Google Cloud Platform, implying the intended use of GCP security features like IAP.
    - The `app.yaml` file configures the application for deployment on Google App Engine, a platform where IAP can be easily integrated.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Backend Authentication and Authorization:** The Django backend application is missing any built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. There is no user login system, session management, or permission checks implemented in the Django code itself.
    - **Django REST Framework or similar:**  Integration of a framework like Django REST Framework with authentication and permission classes would enable fine-grained access control at the API endpoint level.
    - **Authentication Middleware:**  Implementation of Django authentication middleware to verify user credentials before processing API requests is missing.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  There is no RBAC mechanism to define different user roles and permissions within the application.

* Preconditions:
    - The DQM application must be deployed and publicly accessible.
    - GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is either not enabled, misconfigured, or bypassed, allowing direct access to the App Engine application.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`README.md` and `installer.py`**: These files explicitly state the reliance on GCP IAP for access control and the absence of built-in user access restriction in DQM. The `README.md` mentions "DQM has no per-user access restriction, but you do so by enabling GCP [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)]". The `installer.py` script sets up GCP deployment and suggests IAP as an "optional feature (recommended)".
    2. **`backend/dqm/urls.py`**: This file defines the API endpoints for the DQM application.

    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
      path('api/', include([
        path('cache', views.cache),
        path('gaaccounts', views.ga_accounts),
        path('appsettings', views.app_settings),

        path('suites/', include([
          path('', views.suites),
          path('<int:suite_id>', views.suite),
          path('<int:suite_id>/run', views.run_suite),
          path('<int:suite_id>/checks', views.create_check),
          path('<int:suite_id>/checks/<int:check_id>', views.check),
          path('stats', views.stats_suites_executions),
        ])),

        path('checks/', include([
          path('', views.checks_list),
          path('stats', views.stats_checks_executions),
        ])),
      ])),
    ]
    ```
    3. **`backend/dqm/api/views.py`**: This file contains the view functions for the API endpoints. Examining the code, none of the view functions (`cache`, `ga_accounts`, `app_settings`, `suites`, `suite`, `run_suite`, `create_check`, `check`, `stats_suites_executions`, `checks_list`, `stats_checks_executions`) implement any form of authentication or authorization checks. For example, the `suites` view:

    ```python
    def suites_list(request):
      suites = [{
        'id': s.id,
        'name': s.name,
        'created': s.created,
        'updated': s.updated,
        'executions': [{
          'id': se.id,
          'success': se.success,
        } for se in s.executions.all()],
      } for s in Suite.objects.all().prefetch_related(
                  'executions').order_by('-created')]

      # Django would issue (n) db queries to deal with the last execution, so we
      # process it in raw Python...
      for s in suites:
        s['lastExecutionSuccess'] = (s['executions'][-1:][0]['success'] == True
                                      if s['executions'][-1:] else None)
        del(s['executions'])

      return JsonResponse({'suites': suites}, encoder=DqmApiEncoder)
    ```
    This view directly queries the `Suite` model and returns data without any authentication or permission checks. This pattern is consistent across all API views in this file.
    4. **`backend/project/settings/*`**: Reviewing the settings files (`base.py`, `dev.py`, `prod.py`, `__init__.py`), there is no configuration for custom authentication backends or enforced login requirements for API views. The default Django `AuthenticationMiddleware` is present, but it doesn't enforce authentication on its own unless views are explicitly protected.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the DQM application to Google Cloud Platform without enabling or correctly configuring GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
    2. Obtain the public URL of the deployed App Engine application (e.g., `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com`).
    3. Use a web browser or a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to access the API endpoint for listing suites, for example, by sending a GET request to `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com/api/suites`.
    4. Observe that the API returns a JSON response containing a list of suites, even without any prior authentication or providing any credentials.
    5. Attempt to access other API endpoints, such as creating a new suite (POST to `/api/suites`), running a suite (POST to `/api/suites/<suite_id>/run`), or retrieving application settings (GET to `/api/appsettings`).
    6. Verify that all API endpoints are accessible and functional without any authentication, confirming the authentication bypass vulnerability.
