### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical and high severity vulnerabilities identified across multiple vulnerability lists for the DQM application. Duplicate vulnerabilities have been consolidated, and those not meeting the specified criteria (e.g., low/medium severity, unrealistic exploits) have been excluded.

#### 1. Insecure Access Control - Missing Authentication and Authorization (Authentication Bypass)

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker accesses the publicly deployed DQM application without proper authentication.
    2. The attacker bypasses the expected GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) mechanism, for example by directly accessing the App Engine application URL if IAP is not correctly configured or disabled.
    3. Since the Django backend application lacks any built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms, the attacker gains full, unauthorized access to all API endpoints.
    4. The attacker can now perform any actions exposed by the API, including viewing, creating, modifying, and deleting data quality checks, suites, and related configurations.
    5. This unauthorized access allows the attacker to potentially exfiltrate sensitive advertising data, manipulate data quality checks, or disrupt the application's functionality.

*   **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to the entire DQM application and its data.
    - Exposure of sensitive advertising data, including data quality checks and configurations.
    - Ability to manipulate or delete data quality checks, leading to incorrect data quality assessments.
    - Potential disruption of the data quality management process in online advertising.
    - Complete compromise of the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project documentation in `README.md` recommends enabling GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for access restriction.
    - The `installer.py` script guides users to deploy on Google Cloud Platform, implying the intended use of GCP security features like IAP.
    - The `app.yaml` file configures the application for deployment on Google App Engine, a platform where IAP can be easily integrated.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Backend Authentication and Authorization:** The Django backend application is missing any built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. There is no user login system, session management, or permission checks implemented in the Django code itself.
    - **Django REST Framework or similar:**  Integration of a framework like Django REST Framework with authentication and permission classes would enable fine-grained access control at the API endpoint level.
    - **Authentication Middleware:**  Implementation of Django authentication middleware to verify user credentials before processing API requests is missing.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  There is no RBAC mechanism to define different user roles and permissions within the application.
    - **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Enforcement:** While the documentation recommends using Google Cloud IAP, the application itself does not enforce or check for IAP being enabled. The application should ideally check for IAP or implement its own access control if IAP is not enabled, or at least provide clear warnings and instructions to the user during setup and runtime if IAP is not active.


*   **Preconditions:**
    - DQM application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is publicly accessible via a URL.
    - GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is either not enabled, misconfigured, or bypassed, allowing direct access to the App Engine application.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/README.md`: The "Optional features" section explicitly states: "#### Access restriction (recommended) DQM has no per-user access restriction, but you do so by enabling GCP [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/app-engine-quickstart)." This clearly indicates the lack of built-in access control and reliance on external GCP features.
    - `/code/backend/app.yaml`: This file defines the App Engine deployment configuration and does not contain any security related configurations for authentication or authorization.
    - `/code/backend/dqm/urls.py`: API endpoints are defined here, lacking any authentication or authorization configuration.
    - `/code/backend/dqm/api/views.py`: View functions for API endpoints are defined without any authentication or permission checks. For example, the `suites_list` view directly queries and returns data without access control.
    - `/code/project/settings/*`: Settings files lack configuration for custom authentication backends or enforced login requirements for API views.

    ```python
    # Example from backend/dqm/api/views.py - suites_list view
    def suites_list(request):
      suites = [{
        'id': s.id,
        'name': s.name,
        'created': s.created,
        'updated': s.updated,
        'executions': [{
          'id': se.id,
          'success': se.success,
        } for se in s.executions.all()],
      } for s in Suite.objects.all().prefetch_related(
                  'executions').order_by('-created')]

      # Django would issue (n) db queries to deal with the last execution, so we
      # process it in raw Python...
      for s in suites:
        s['lastExecutionSuccess'] = (s['executions'][-1:][0]['success'] == True
                                      if s['executions'][-1:] else None)
        del(s['executions'])

      return JsonResponse({'suites': suites}, encoder=DqmApiEncoder)
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the DQM application to Google Cloud Platform without enabling or correctly configuring GCP Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
    2. Obtain the public URL of the deployed App Engine application (e.g., `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com`).
    3. Use a web browser or a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to access the API endpoint for listing suites, for example, by sending a GET request to `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com/api/suites`.
    4. Observe that the API returns a JSON response containing a list of suites, even without any prior authentication or providing any credentials.
    5. Attempt to access other API endpoints and verify that all API endpoints are accessible and functional without any authentication, confirming the authentication bypass vulnerability.


#### 2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Check Comments

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the DQM application can create or edit a Data Quality Check.
    2.  In the "comments" field of the Check definition, the attacker injects malicious Javascript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3.  The application stores this malicious comment in the database without proper sanitization or encoding.
    4.  When another user views the Check definition or any page displaying this comment (e.g., in the suite or check details view in the frontend), the malicious Javascript code is executed in their browser.
    5.  This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or further malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or credentials of other users who view the malicious comment.
    *   Data Theft: The attacker could use Javascript to extract sensitive data displayed on the page and send it to a remote server.
    *   Malware Distribution: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
    *   Defacement: The attacker could alter the visual appearance of the application for other users.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None observed in the provided code. The application stores and retrieves the "comments" field without any explicit sanitization or encoding.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization: Sanitize user input in the "comments" field on the backend before storing it in the database.
    *   Output encoding: Encode the "comments" field when rendering it in the frontend.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker needs to have user access to the DQM application to create or edit checks.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/backend/dqm/models.py`: The `comments` field in the `Check` model is a `TextField`, storing arbitrary text without sanitization.
    ```python
    class Check(models.Model):
        ...
        comments = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
        ...
    ```
    - `/code/backend/dqm/api/views.py`: The `update_check` view updates the `Check` model with the provided payload, including the `comments` field, without sanitization.
    ```python
    @csrf_exempt
    @require_http_methods(['PUT'])
    def update_check(request, suite_id, check_id):
      payload = json.loads(request.body)
      payload['params_json'] = json.dumps(payload.pop('paramValues'))
      try:
        del payload['resultFields']
      except:
        pass
      try:
        del payload['checkMetadata']
      except:
        pass
      Check.objects.filter(id=check_id).update(**payload)
      return JsonResponse({'check': None}, encoder=DqmApiEncoder)
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Log in to the DQM application as an attacker user.
    2.  Navigate to the "Suites" or "Checks" section.
    3.  Create a new Data Quality Check or edit an existing one.
    4.  In the "comments" field, enter the malicious payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-comments-field')>`.
    5.  Save the Check.
    6.  Log out and log in as a different user, or simply refresh the page and navigate to the check details or suite view.
    7.  Observe if an alert box with "XSS-comments-field" is displayed, confirming the Stored XSS vulnerability.


#### 3. Insecure Storage and Exposure of GCP Service Account Key

*   **Description:**
    1. The `installer.py` script downloads a GCP service account key (`key.json`) and stores it within the `backend` directory of the application code.
    2. The `app.yaml` configuration file for Google App Engine deployment is set to include this `key.json` file in the deployed application package by referencing it via the `DQM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
    3. During deployment to Google App Engine, the `key.json` file is uploaded along with the application code.
    4. Once deployed, the application code, specifically in `backend/helpers/analytics.py`, uses this `key.json` file to authenticate with Google Cloud services.
    5. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the deployed App Engine instance or the source code repository can potentially retrieve the `key.json` file.
    6. With the `key.json` file, the attacker can impersonate the service account and gain unauthorized access to the associated GCP project and its resources.

*   **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Unauthorized access to the GCP project.
    - Full control over GCP resources within the project, including databases (Cloud SQL), Google Analytics data, and potentially other GCP services.
    - Data exfiltration, modification, or deletion within the GCP project.
    - Potential for further lateral movement within the GCP infrastructure if the service account has broader permissions.
    - Financial impact due to unauthorized usage of GCP resources.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The provided code and documentation do not include any mitigations for securely managing or storing the service account key.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Key Management System:** Implement a secure key management system like Google Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) or HashiCorp Vault.
    - **Workload Identity Federation:** Utilize Workload Identity Federation to eliminate the need for storing `key.json`.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict the permissions granted to the service account to the minimum necessary.
    - **Secret Manager:** Consider using Google Cloud Secret Manager to store the service account key as a secret.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed to Google App Engine using the provided installation instructions, which involve downloading and deploying the `key.json` file.
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the deployed App Engine instance or the source code repository.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/installer.py`: Downloads `key.json` to `backend/`.
    ```python
    subprocess.check_output(['gcloud', 'iam', 'service-accounts', 'keys', 'create', './key.json', '--iam-account', f'{project_id}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com'], cwd='dqm/backend')
    ```
    - `/code/backend/app.yaml`: Includes `key.json` in deployment.
    ```yaml
    env_variables:
      DQM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH: "key.json"
    ```
    - `/code/backend/project/settings/base.py`: Sets `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` setting.
    ```python
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = os.getenv('DQM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH', 'key.json')
    ```
    - `/code/backend/dqm/helpers/analytics.py`: Loads `key.json` for authentication.
    ```python
    credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(
      settings.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, SCOPES)
    ```

    ```
    installer.py --> downloads key.json --> backend/
    backend/app.yaml --> includes key.json in deployment package
    Deployment to App Engine --> key.json deployed with application
    backend/dqm/helpers/analytics.py --> loads key.json for authentication
    Attacker access App Engine instance/repo --> potential key.json retrieval --> GCP access
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the DQM application to Google App Engine with `key.json` in the `backend` directory.
    2. Attempt to access the App Engine instance's file system (or simulate access via deployment package/repository).
    3. Locate and download/copy the `key.json` file from the `backend` directory.
    4. Use the Google Cloud SDK to authenticate as the service account using the downloaded `key.json`:
       ```bash
       gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=path/to/key.json
       ```
    5. Attempt to access GCP resources within the project to confirm unauthorized access via the exposed key. For example list Cloud SQL instances:
       ```bash
       gcloud sql instances list --project=[YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID]
       ```
