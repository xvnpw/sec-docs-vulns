### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `--store_dir` argument

    * Description:
      The `main.py` script uses the `--store_dir` command-line argument to specify the directory where experiment results and checkpoints are stored. This directory path, provided by the user, is directly used in file system operations without proper sanitization. A malicious user can craft a `--store_dir` argument containing path traversal sequences like `../` to manipulate the directory where files are written. For example, by providing `--store_dir /tmp/../../malicious_dir`, the application might write files into the `/malicious_dir` directory, outside the intended project directory.

      Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
      1. An attacker executes the `main.py` script.
      2. The attacker provides a crafted `--store_dir` argument that includes path traversal sequences, such as `../` or absolute paths pointing outside the intended storage directory. For example: `--store_dir /tmp/../../malicious_dir`.
      3. The `main.py` script uses this unsanitized path to construct file paths for storing checkpoints and experiment results using `os.path.join`.
      4. Due to path traversal sequences, files are written to a directory outside the intended storage location, as specified by the attacker in the crafted `--store_dir` argument.

    * Impact:
      A successful path traversal attack can lead to arbitrary file write. An attacker could potentially:
        - Overwrite critical system files, leading to system instability or denial of service.
        - Write files to sensitive directories, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
        - Write malicious scripts or executables to startup directories or other locations where they might be executed, leading to further compromise of the system.
        - Expose sensitive information by writing experiment data to publicly accessible directories.

    * Vulnerability Rank: High

    * Currently Implemented Mitigations:
      None. The code directly uses the user-supplied `--store_dir` argument without any validation or sanitization.

    * Missing Mitigations:
      - **Path Sanitization:** Implement path sanitization to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like `../` from the user-supplied `--store_dir` argument.
      - **Path Validation:** Validate the provided `--store_dir` argument to ensure it is within an expected base directory and does not contain malicious path traversal sequences. Consider using functions like `os.path.abspath` and checking if the resulting path is still within the intended base directory.
      - **Restrict Path Scope:**  Instead of allowing arbitrary paths, restrict the `--store_dir` to be a subdirectory within a predefined project results directory.

    * Preconditions:
      - The user must be able to execute the `main.py` script and provide command-line arguments, specifically the `--store_dir` argument.
      - The application must have write permissions to the file system locations where the attacker intends to write files through path traversal.

    * Source Code Analysis:
      1. **`wide_bnn_sampling/main.py`:**
         - The `store_dir` flag is defined:
           ```python
           flags.DEFINE_string(
               'store_dir', '~/wide_bnn_sampling', 'storage location')
           ```
         - The `store_dir` flag value is accessed as `FLAGS.store_dir` and passed to `measurements.Measurements`:
           ```python
           m = measurements.Measurements(FLAGS.store_dir, FLAGS.init_store_dir)
           ```
      2. **`wide_bnn_sampling/measurements.py`:**
         - In the `Measurements` class constructor, the `store_dir` argument is directly assigned to `self.save_dir`:
           ```python
           self.save_dir = store_dir
           ```
      3. **`wide_bnn_sampling/checkpoint.py`:**
         - The `_get_checkpoint_path` function uses `os.path.join` with `save_dir` to construct the checkpoint path:
           ```python
           def _get_checkpoint_path(save_dir, sid):
             path = os.path.join(save_dir, 'checkpoint')
             if sid is not None:
               path = os.path.join(path, str(sid))
             return path
           ```
         - The `save_checkpoint` function uses `_get_checkpoint_path` to determine the checkpoint directory and `os.makedirs` to create it:
           ```python
           path = _get_checkpoint_path(save_dir, sid)
           if not os.path.exists(path):
             os.makedirs(path)
           ```
         - No sanitization or validation is performed on the `save_dir` path before using it in `os.path.join` or `os.makedirs`.

      **Visualization:**

      ```
      main.py --> measurements.py (store_dir is passed) --> checkpoint.py (store_dir used in os.path.join & os.makedirs)
      FLAGS.store_dir -----------------> Measurements.save_dir ---------------------> _get_checkpoint_path/save_checkpoint
      (user input)                                                                    (vulnerable functions)
      ```

    * Security Test Case:
      1. **Environment Setup:**
         - Set up a testing environment with Python and the project dependencies installed as described in the `README.md`.
         - Create a temporary directory, e.g., `/tmp/test_dir`, where you do *not* expect files to be written under normal operation.
      2. **Execute `main.py` with crafted `--store_dir`:**
         - Run the `main.py` script with a crafted `--store_dir` argument that attempts path traversal. For example:
           ```bash
           python3 wide_bnn_sampling/main.py --config wide_bnn_sampling/config.py --store_dir '/tmp/../../test_dir'
           ```
         - Replace `/tmp/../../test_dir` with a path that is outside the intended project directory but writable by the user running the script.
      3. **Verify File Creation in Unexpected Location:**
         - After the script execution completes (or after it has run for a short duration if it's a long-running process), check if a `checkpoint` directory and files within it have been created in the `/tmp/test_dir` directory.
           ```bash
           ls /tmp/test_dir/checkpoint
           ```
         - If files are found in `/tmp/test_dir/checkpoint`, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the application wrote files to an unexpected location based on the crafted `--store_dir` argument.
      4. **Expected Outcome:**
         - If the vulnerability exists, you will find a `checkpoint` directory and files within it inside `/tmp/test_dir`, demonstrating that the path traversal was successful and the application wrote files outside the intended directory.
         - If the vulnerability is mitigated, no `checkpoint` directory or files should be found in `/tmp/test_dir`. The files should be written in the default or intended `store_dir`.

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Dataset Loading
    * Description:
      1. The `wide_bnn_sampling` library uses `tensorflow_datasets` to load datasets.
      2. The `datasets.get_dataset` function in `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/datasets.py` uses `tfds.load` and takes `data_dir` as an argument to specify the dataset directory.
      3. The `data_dir` is configurable via the `config.py` file and command line flag `--config` in `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/main.py`.
      4. The `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/main.py` script reads the `data_dir` from the configuration and passes it directly to the `datasets.cifar10_tfds` function, which then calls `datasets.get_dataset`.
      5. The `datasets.get_dataset` function directly passes the user-controlled `data_dir` to `tfds.load` without sufficient validation or sanitization.
      6. While `tfds.load` is intended for datasets, a malicious user could potentially provide a path that, while not directly leading to arbitrary file read, could cause `tfds.load` to interact with unintended directories or datasets if not properly validated. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or potentially be leveraged in more complex attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the environment where this library is used. The risk is that by manipulating the `data_dir`, an attacker can influence the data loading process to access or attempt to access locations outside of the intended dataset storage, which is a form of path traversal.
    * Impact:
      - By controlling the `data_dir`, an attacker can influence the dataset loading to access or attempt to access locations outside the intended dataset storage. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, errors, or potentially be a stepping stone for more serious attacks depending on the broader application context where this library is used. While not direct arbitrary file read, it represents a path traversal issue in how dataset locations are handled.
    * Vulnerability Rank: Medium
    * Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
    * Missing Mitigations:
      - Sanitize and validate the `data_dir` input to ensure it is a safe path and restrict access to only the intended dataset directories.
      - Implement checks to prevent path traversal characters like `..` in `data_dir`.
      - Consider using a whitelist of allowed dataset directories or more robust path validation for `data_dir`.
    * Preconditions:
      - The user must run the `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/main.py` script.
      - The attacker must be able to control the configuration file or command line arguments, specifically the `data_dir` parameter.
    * Source Code Analysis:
      - File: `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/datasets.py`
        ```python
        def get_dataset(
            name,
            data_dir=None,  # User-controlled data_dir
            input_key='image'):
          ...
          ds_train, ds_test = tfds.as_numpy(
              tfds.load(
                  name + (':3.*.*' if name != 'imdb_reviews' else ''),
                  split=['train' + ('[:%d]' % n_train if n_train is not None else ''),
                         'test' + ('[:%d]' % n_test if n_train is not None else '')],
                  batch_size=-1,
                  as_dataset_kwargs={'shuffle_files': False},
                  data_dir=data_dir)) # data_dir passed directly to tfds.load
          ...
        ```
      - File: `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/main.py`
        ```python
        config_flags.DEFINE_config_file(
            name='config',
            default=None,
            help_string='training configuration')
        ...
        def run_experiment(C: config_dict.ConfigDict, m: measurements.Measurements):
          ...
          ds = datasets.cifar10_tfds(
              data_dir=C.data_dir) # data_dir from config
          ...
        ```
      - File: `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/config.py`
        ```python
        def get_config():
          ...
          C.data_dir = '' # Default value, can be overridden by config file or command line
          ...
          return C
        ```
    * Security Test Case:
      1. Create a malicious configuration file `malicious_config.py` with the following content:
         ```python
         from ml_collections import config_dict

         def get_config():
           C = config_dict.ConfigDict()
           C.data_dir = '/tmp' # Malicious data_dir, point to tmp
           C.n_train = 1
           C.n_test = 1
           C.architecture = 'fcn'
           C.reparam_type = 'identity'
           C.step_count = 1
           C.burn_in = 0
           C.thin = 1
           C.save_stats = False
           return C
         ```
      2. Run the `/code/wide_bnn_sampling/main.py` script with the malicious configuration file:
         ```bash
         python3 wide_bnn_sampling/main.py --config malicious_config.py --store_dir test_results
         ```
      3. Observe the program's execution and any error messages. Check if the program attempts to load datasets from `/tmp`. Because `/tmp` is a common directory but not intended for datasets, if the program proceeds without error or tries to access datasets within `/tmp`, it indicates that the `data_dir` is being used without proper validation, confirming the path traversal risk.
      4. Examine the logs or output for any unusual behavior related to dataset loading or file access in `/tmp`. Successful execution without errors when pointing `data_dir` to `/tmp` (a non-dataset directory) would indicate a lack of proper validation and the presence of a path traversal risk.

* Vulnerability Name: Numerical Instability in Bayesian Neural Network Sampling due to Low Precision

    * Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious input dataset specifically designed to trigger numerical instability in the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) sampling process.
        2. The user runs the BNN sampling code with this malicious dataset, potentially using default `float32` precision as suggested as a minimum in the documentation.
        3. During the execution, specifically within the `_get_nngp_energy_fn` function in `reparametrisation.py`, the Gram matrix calculation becomes ill-conditioned due to the crafted input data and limited numerical precision.
        4. This ill-conditioning leads to numerical instability during the Cholesky decomposition step performed by `jax.scipy.linalg.cho_factor`. The Cholesky decomposition may fail, produce inaccurate results, or lead to exceptions.
        5. Consequently, the subsequent steps in the BNN sampling process, which rely on the Cholesky decomposition (triangular solves, energy calculations, sampler updates in `samplers.py`), become unreliable and produce incorrect or nonsensical samples from the BNN posterior.
        6. The user, unaware of the numerical instability, might rely on these incorrect samples for downstream tasks, leading to flawed conclusions or decisions.

    * Impact:
        Users of the library may obtain incorrect or unreliable samples from the Bayesian Neural Network posterior when using crafted input datasets and lower computational precision (like `float32`). This can lead to inaccurate scientific results, flawed model predictions, and incorrect decision-making based on the BNN sampling output. The vulnerability undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of the BNN sampling library.

    * Vulnerability Rank: Medium

    * Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        * **Documentation Warning:** The `README.md` file includes a "CAVEAT" section explicitly warning users about potential numerical instability issues when using low computational precision. It recommends using at least `float32`, but prefers `float64` and mentions JAX flags `jax_enable_x64` and `jax_default_matmul_precision` for controlling precision. This warning serves as a documentation-based mitigation.
        * **JAX Precision Flags:** The `main.py` script includes code to update JAX configuration related to numerical precision: `jax.config.update('jax_numpy_rank_promotion', 'raise')` and `jax.config.parse_flags_with_absl()`.  While not directly enforcing higher precision, the project uses JAX features that allow users to control precision, and the README guides them to use these features for mitigation.

    * Missing Mitigations:
        * **Input Validation:** Implement checks within the code to detect potentially problematic input datasets that might lead to ill-conditioned Gram matrices. This could involve analyzing the properties of the input data, although designing robust and general input validation for numerical stability is challenging.
        * **Robust Numerical Methods:** Explore and potentially integrate more robust numerical methods for Cholesky decomposition or alternative approaches that are less sensitive to numerical precision issues, if available within JAX or compatible libraries.
        * **Runtime Precision Checks and Warnings:** Add runtime checks within the code to monitor numerical stability during Cholesky decomposition or related operations. If potential instability is detected (e.g., based on condition number estimates or error flags from numerical routines), issue a warning to the user, especially when `float32` precision is used.
        * **Security Test Case in Test Suite:** Include a security-focused test case in the project's test suite that specifically targets and demonstrates this numerical instability vulnerability. This test case would serve as an ongoing check to prevent regressions and highlight the importance of using appropriate precision.

    * Preconditions:
        * The user must be running the BNN sampling code with `float32` or lower computational precision in JAX. This is often the default or a common setting for performance reasons, making it a likely scenario.
        * The user must provide a maliciously crafted input dataset. This dataset needs to be designed in a way that, when processed by the BNN model's embedding function, results in a Gram matrix in `_get_nngp_energy_fn` that is nearly singular or ill-conditioned, exacerbating numerical precision limitations.

    * Source Code Analysis:
        1. **`reparametrisation.py` - `_get_nngp_energy_fn`:**
            ```python
            def _get_nngp_energy_fn(
                embed, unflatten, kernel_reg, noise_scale, w_std_out, b_std_out, parallel):
                ...
                def energy_fn(phi, x, y):
                    ...
                    # compute Gram matrix
                    emb = embed(phi, x)
                    temb = jnp.hstack((w_std_out * emb, b_std_out * jnp.ones((len(emb), 1))))
                    gram = temb.T @ temb

                    # add regularisation and compute the Cholesky decomposition
                    gram += kernel_reg * jnp.eye(temb.shape[-1])
                    cho, lower = jax.scipy.linalg.cho_factor(gram) # NUMERICAL INSTABILITY POINT

                    # triangular solves (relying on cho)
                    theta_out += jax.lax.linalg.triangular_solve( ... cho ... )
                    theta_out = jax.lax.linalg.triangular_solve( ... cho ... )
                    ...
                    logdet = d_out * jnp.sum(0.5 * jnp.log(kernel_reg) - jnp.log(jnp.diag(cho))) # logdet calculation relies on cho
                    ...
                    return energy, (theta, logdet, stats)
                return energy_fn
            ```
            The vulnerability is triggered within the `_get_nngp_energy_fn` function, specifically at the line `cho, lower = jax.scipy.linalg.cho_factor(gram)`. If the `gram` matrix, computed as `temb.T @ temb` from the embeddings `temb`, becomes nearly singular due to a malicious input dataset and `float32` precision, the Cholesky decomposition will be numerically unstable. This instability propagates through subsequent calculations that depend on `cho`, including the triangular solves and the `logdet` computation.

        2. **Impact Propagation:** The inaccurate `cho` factor and `logdet` value directly affect the `energy_fn` output. This `energy_fn` is used by the samplers in `samplers.py` (e.g., `hmc`, `gauss_mh`). Incorrect energy values lead to incorrect acceptance probabilities and ultimately to the samplers drawing samples from a distribution that deviates significantly from the true BNN posterior.

        3. **`samplers.py` - `hmc` and `gauss_mh`:**
            ```python
            def hmc(energy_fn, logp_diff_fn, ...):
                ...
                def sample_fn(key, state, x, y):
                    ...
                    (energy_new, aux), g_new = energy_vg(phi_new, x, y) # Calls energy_fn
                    ...
                    log_p_acc = logp_diff_fn(theta, theta_new, x, y) + logdet_new - logdet # logdet from energy_fn
                    ...
                    p_acc = jnp.minimum(1.0, jnp.exp(log_p_acc)) # Acceptance probability calculation
                    ...
                    state['energy'] = update(energy, energy_new) # Energy value update
                    ...
                    return state, stats
                return init_fn, sample_fn
            ```
            The `hmc` (and similarly `gauss_mh`) sampler uses the `energy_fn` to evaluate the energy of the proposed and current states. The acceptance probability `p_acc` is calculated based on the difference in energy and `logdet`. If `energy_fn` returns incorrect values due to numerical instability in Cholesky decomposition, the calculated `p_acc` will be wrong, leading to a flawed sampling process.

            ```

        2. **Malicious Input Data:** Create a simple, small, and highly correlated input dataset to potentially induce ill-conditioning in the Gram matrix.
            ```python
            x_malicious = jnp.array([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]], dtype=jnp.float32) # Highly correlated inputs
            y_malicious = jnp.array([[0.5], [0.5], [0.5]], dtype=jnp.float32)
            ```

        3. **Initialize Sampler with `float32` and Run a Few Steps:**
            ```python
            key, init_key = jax.random.split(key)
            key, state = sampler_init(init_key, x_malicious, y_malicious)

            stats_float32 = []
            for _ in range(10): # Run a few steps
                key, state, stats = sampler_step(key, state, x_malicious, y_malicious)
                stats_float32.append(stats)
            print("Stats with float32:", stats_float32)
            ```

        4. **Repeat with `float64` Precision for Comparison:**
            ```python
            jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True) # Enable float64 precision
            key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0) # Reset key for fair comparison

            init_fn, apply_fn, _, embed_fn = models.get_network(d_out=d_out, C=C) # Re-init model for float64
            _, unflatten = jax.flatten_util.ravel_pytree(init_fn(key, (1,)))

            apply_flat = lambda pf, x: apply_fn(unflatten(pf), x)
            embed_flat = lambda pf, x: embed_fn(unflatten(pf), x)

            energy_fn_float64 = reparam.get_energy_fn( # Re-init energy_fn for float64
                reparam_type=C.reparam_type, apply_flat=apply_flat, embed_flat=embed_flat,
                unflatten=unflatten, noise_scale=C.noise_scale, kernel_reg=C.noise_scale**2,
                w_std_out=C.w_std_out, b_std_out=C.b_std_out, parallel=C.parallel)

            logp_diff_fn_float64 = reparam.get_logp_diff_fn( # Re-init logp_diff_fn for float64
                apply_flat=apply_flat, noise_scale=C.noise_scale, parallel=C.parallel)

            sampler_init_float64, sampler_step_float64 = samplers.hmc( # Re-init sampler for float64
                energy_fn=energy_fn_float64, logp_diff_fn=logp_diff_fn_float64, mcmc_beta=C.mcmc_beta,
                stepsize=C.stepsize, n_steps=1, parallel=C.parallel, mass=1.0, skip_mh=False)

            key, init_key = jax.random.split(key)
            key, state_float64 = sampler_init_float64(init_key, x_malicious, y_malicious)

            stats_float64 = []
            for _ in range(10): # Run a few steps with float64
                key, state_float64, stats = sampler_step_float64(key, state_float64, x_malicious, y_malicious)
                stats_float64.append(stats)
            print("Stats with float64:", stats_float64)
            ```

        5. **Compare Results:** Analyze `stats_float32` and `stats_float64`. Look for significant differences in:
            * `p_acc`: Acceptance probabilities. Numerically unstable cases might show deteriorated or erratic acceptance probabilities.
            * `energy`, `energy_new`: Energy values. Unstable cases might show nonsensical or diverging energy values.
            * `logdet`: Log determinant. This value is directly affected by the Cholesky decomposition and will likely show significant differences if instability occurs.

            **Expected Outcome:** With the malicious input and `float32` precision, you might observe significantly lower or more erratic acceptance probabilities, and potentially unstable energy and logdet values compared to the `float64` results. This discrepancy demonstrates the numerical instability vulnerability when using lower precision with specific inputs.  The severity of the effect may vary depending on the network architecture, hyperparameters, and the crafted input dataset. You might need to adjust the input data or network configuration to clearly observe the vulnerability.
