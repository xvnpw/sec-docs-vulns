- Vulnerability name: GAQL Injection via Macros/Templates
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload designed for GAQL injection. This payload could be a string containing malicious GAQL clauses or functions.
  2. The attacker injects this malicious payload into a macro or template parameter when running `gaarf`. This could be achieved through command-line arguments like `--macro.<macro_name>=<payload>` or `--template.<template_name>=<payload>`, or by modifying configuration files (`.gaarfrc`, `gaarf.yaml`, `google-ads.yaml`) if those are under attacker's control in some scenarios (less likely for external attacker but possible in compromised environments).
  3. When `gaarf` processes the query, it substitutes the macro or template placeholders with the attacker-controlled payload *without sufficient sanitization*.
  4. The resulting string, now containing the injected GAQL code, is used as a query against the Google Ads API.
  5. The Google Ads API executes the crafted GAQL query, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass intended restrictions and access sensitive data beyond the scope of the original report. For example, the attacker could modify the `WHERE` clause to broaden the data selection or add `SELECT` fields to extract additional sensitive information.
- Impact:
  An attacker can successfully perform a GAQL injection attack, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive Google Ads data. This could include:
  1. **Data Breach:** Extraction of confidential marketing data, customer information, or competitive insights.
  2. **Reputation Damage:** Leakage of sensitive data can severely damage the reputation and trust of the organization using `gaarf`.
  3. **Financial Loss:**  Unauthorized access to advertising performance data or budget information could lead to financial misinterpretations or manipulations.
  4. **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and associated penalties.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  No explicit mitigations are mentioned in the provided project files. The tool's design relies on string substitution for macros and templates, which, without sanitization, inherently leads to this vulnerability.
- Missing mitigations:
  1. **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization and validation of all user-provided inputs used in macros and templates. This should involve escaping or removing potentially harmful GAQL syntax from user-supplied values.
  2. **Parameterized Queries:**  Ideally, the macro and template functionality should be redesigned to use parameterized queries instead of string substitution. Parameterized queries prevent injection attacks by separating the query structure from user-supplied data, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not executable code. However, GAQL might not fully support parameterization in the same way as SQL. Explore if the Google Ads API offers any safer mechanisms for dynamic query construction.
  3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Google Ads API credentials used by `gaarf` have the minimum necessary permissions. Restrict API access to only the data and operations genuinely required for report fetching. This limits the potential damage even if a GAQL injection is successful.
  4. **Documentation and Warnings:** Clearly document the risks of GAQL injection, especially when using macros and templates with external or untrusted input sources. Warn users about the importance of carefully constructing queries and sanitizing inputs.

- Preconditions:
  1. The attacker must have the ability to influence the input parameters of `gaarf`, specifically macro or template values. This is typically possible through command-line arguments or configuration files.
  2. The `gaarf` tool must be configured to use macros or templates in its queries.
  3. The Google Ads account being queried must contain sensitive data that the attacker is interested in accessing.
- Source code analysis:
  (Due to the absence of provided source code, a precise line-by-line analysis is not possible. However, based on the documentation and feature description, we can infer the vulnerable points.)

  1. **Query Parsing and Substitution:** The `gaarf` tool likely has a module responsible for parsing query files (e.g., SQL files) and identifying macro and template placeholders (e.g., `{macro_name}`, `{% template_logic %}`).
  2. **Macro and Template Processing:**  The tool then processes macros and templates. For macros, this probably involves simple string replacement of placeholders with values provided via command-line arguments or config files. For templates (Jinja/Nunjucks), the template engine likely renders the query string based on provided template parameters.
  3. **Lack of Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises if the code *directly substitutes* user-provided macro or template values into the GAQL query string *without any sanitization or validation*. This means if a user provides a malicious string as a macro value, that string is inserted verbatim into the GAQL query.
  4. **GAQL Execution:** Finally, `gaarf` uses the constructed GAQL query and the Google Ads API client to fetch the report. Because the malicious payload is now part of the GAQL query, the Google Ads API executes it as intended, leading to the injection vulnerability.

  **Visualization (Conceptual):**

  ```
  User Input (Malicious Payload) --> Macro/Template Parameter --> Gaarf Tool (String Substitution - No Sanitization) --> Crafted GAQL Query (Malicious Code Injected) --> Google Ads API --> Data Breach
  ```

- Security test case:
  1. **Setup:** Assume you have a running instance of `gaarf` (Python or Node.js version) and access to a Google Ads account for testing. Prepare a simple GAQL query file (e.g., `test_query.sql`) that uses a macro, for example:

     ```sql
     SELECT
         campaign.name
     FROM campaign
     WHERE campaign.status = "{campaign_status}"
     LIMIT 10
     ```

  2. **Normal Execution (Baseline):** Run `gaarf` with a normal macro value to establish a baseline and ensure the tool works as expected. For example:

     ```bash
     gaarf test_query.sql --account=<YOUR_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID> --output=console --macro.campaign_status=ENABLED
     ```
     Verify that the command executes successfully and returns campaign names for enabled campaigns.

  3. **Injection Attempt - Modifying WHERE Clause:**  Craft a malicious payload to inject additional conditions into the `WHERE` clause, attempting to bypass the intended filter and extract more data. For example, try to inject `OR customer.id != <YOUR_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID>` to potentially access data outside your account (if possible in your test environment and permissions):

     ```bash
     gaarf test_query.sql --account=<YOUR_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID> --output=console --macro.campaign_status='ENABLED" OR customer.id != <YOUR_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID> OR campaign.status = "'
     ```
     *Note:* The payload is designed to close the existing `WHERE` clause condition (`campaign.status = "ENABLED"`) by adding a quote (`"`) and then inject `OR customer.id != <YOUR_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID> OR campaign.status = "`. This is a simplified example; more sophisticated payloads might be needed depending on the parsing logic.*

  4. **Analyze Results:**
     - **Vulnerable:** If the command executes *without errors* and returns data that *should not* be accessible based on the original query (e.g., data from a different `customer.id` if that's possible in your testing context, or campaigns with statuses other than `ENABLED` due to bypassed filtering), then the GAQL injection is successful.
     - **Not Vulnerable (Mitigated):** If the command fails with a GAQL error, or if it executes but only returns data consistent with the *intended* query (campaigns with `ENABLED` status from *your* account), then the tool might have some implicit or explicit sanitization, or the injection attempt was not effective. However, further testing with different payloads would be needed to confirm robust mitigation.

  5. **Further Test Cases:** Explore other injection payloads to test different injection points and potential impacts:
     - Injecting `SELECT` fields to extract sensitive columns not originally in the query.
     - Injecting malicious functions or operators (if GAQL supports them and if the tool's macro substitution occurs at a vulnerable point).
     - Testing different output formats and writers to see if the vulnerability behavior changes.

  **Expected Outcome of Successful Test Case:**
  The security test case should demonstrate that by manipulating macro or template inputs, an attacker can alter the generated GAQL query and potentially extract data beyond the intended scope, proving the existence of a GAQL injection vulnerability.
