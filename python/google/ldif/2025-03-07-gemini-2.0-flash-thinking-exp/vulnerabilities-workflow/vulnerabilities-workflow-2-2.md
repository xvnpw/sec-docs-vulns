- vulnerability name: Mesh Parsing Vulnerability in GAPS Library
- description: An attacker can craft a malicious 3D mesh file (e.g., a manipulated `.ply` file) and provide it as input to the `meshes2dataset.py` script via the `--mesh_directory` argument. This script uses GAPS library executables like `msh2msh`, `msh2df`, `msh2pts`, `scn2img`, `conf2img`, `grd2msh` to process the mesh file. If GAPS library has vulnerabilities in parsing mesh files, processing the malicious mesh file could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is triggered when `meshes2dataset.py` script calls GAPS executables to process the malicious mesh file.
- impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations:
  - The project relies on the external GAPS library for mesh processing. There are no mitigations implemented within the provided project code itself to specifically address potential vulnerabilities in GAPS mesh parsing. The `build_gaps.sh` script clones and builds GAPS from source, but it doesn't include any patches or modifications to enhance security.
- missing mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization of mesh files before processing them with GAPS. The project should implement checks to ensure that mesh files conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious data that could exploit parsing vulnerabilities in GAPS.
  - Using a sandboxed environment to execute GAPS executables. This could limit the impact of a potential exploit by restricting the permissions and access of the GAPS processes.
  - Regularly updating the GAPS library to the latest version and applying security patches. The project should have a mechanism to update GAPS to address known vulnerabilities. However, as GAPS is cloned from a specific commit, updates are not automatically incorporated.
- preconditions:
  - The user must download and run the `meshes2dataset.py` script.
  - The user must provide a path to a directory containing the malicious mesh file using the `--mesh_directory` argument.
  - The GAPS library must be vulnerable to mesh parsing exploits.
- source code analysis:
  - `meshes2dataset.py`: This script is the primary entry point for dataset creation. It takes `--mesh_directory` as input, which is the directory containing mesh files provided by the user.
  ```python
  python meshes2dataset.py --mesh_directory ${d}/input_meshes \
    --dataset_directory ${d}/output_dataset
  ```
  - The `process_one` function in `meshes2dataset.py` calls `make_example.mesh_to_example`.
  ```python
  def process_one(f, mesh_directory, dataset_directory, skip_existing, log_level):
      ...
      make_example.mesh_to_example(
          os.path.join(path_util.get_path_to_ldif_parent(), 'ldif'), f,
          f'{dataset_directory}/{split}/{synset}/{name}/', skip_existing, log_level)
      ...
  ```
  - `make_example.mesh_to_example` in turn calls `process_mesh_local.sh`.
  ```python
  def mesh_to_example(...):
      ...
      cmd = f'{codebase_root_dir}/scripts/process_mesh_local.sh "{mesh_path}" "{output_dir}" "{ldif_root}"'
      log.verbose(f'Executing command {cmd}')
      sp.check_output(cmd, shell=True, executable='/bin/bash')
      ...
  ```
  - `process_mesh_local.sh` script executes various GAPS executables on the input mesh file `$mesh_in`. These executables include `msh2msh`, `msh2df`, `msh2pts`, `scn2img`, `conf2img`.
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  ...
  gaps=${ldif_root}/gaps/bin/x86_64/
  ...
  # Step 0) Normalize the mesh before applying all other operations.
  ${gaps}/msh2msh $mesh_orig $mesh -scale_by_pca -translate_by_centroid \
    -scale 0\.25 -debug_matrix ${outdir}/orig_to_gaps.txt

  # Step 1) Generate the coarse inside/outside grid:
  ${gaps}/msh2df $mesh ${outdir}/coarse_grid.grd -bbox -0\.7 -0\.7 -0\.7 0\.7 \
    0\.7 0\.7 -border 0 -spacing 0\.044 -estimate_sign -v

  # Step 2) Generate the near surface points:
  ${gaps}/msh2pts $mesh ${outdir}/nss_points.sdf -near_surface -max_distance \
    0\.04 -num_points 100000 -v -binary_sdf # -curvature_exponent 0

  # Step 3) Generate the uniform points:
  ${gaps}/msh2pts $mesh ${outdir}/uniform_points.sdf -uniform_in_bbox -bbox \
    -0\.7 -0\.7 -0\.7 0\.7 0\.7 0\.7 -npoints 100000 -binary_sdf

  # Step 4) Generate the depth renders:
  depth_dir=${outdir}/depth_images/
  ${gaps}/scn2img $mesh $dodeca_path $depth_dir -capture_depth_images \
    $mesa -width 224 -height 224

  ${gaps}/conf2img $local_conf ${outdir}/normals \
    -create_normal_images -width 224 -height 224 $mesa
  ...
  ```
  - The GAPS executables are built using `build_gaps.sh`.
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  ...
  make mesa -j8
  ...
  ```
  - There is no sanitization of the input mesh file in these scripts before passing it to GAPS executables. This means that if GAPS has parsing vulnerabilities, they can be exploited.

- security test case:
  - Step 1: Create a malicious `.ply` file. This file should be crafted to exploit a known or potential vulnerability in a mesh parsing library, specifically targeting `.ply` parsing as required format. For example, if GAPS is known to have a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing vertex data in `.ply` files, craft a `.ply` file with an excessively large number of vertices or malformed vertex data.
  - Step 2: Place the malicious `.ply` file in a directory accessible to the `meshes2dataset.py` script. For example, create a directory named `malicious_meshes` and place the malicious `malicious.ply` file inside it.
  - Step 3: Run the `meshes2dataset.py` script, providing the path to the `malicious_meshes` directory using the `--mesh_directory` argument and an output directory using `--dataset_directory`.
  ```bash
  python meshes2dataset.py --mesh_directory ./malicious_meshes --dataset_directory ./output_dataset
  ```
  - Step 4: Monitor the execution of the script. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, it could lead to:
    - A crash of the `meshes2dataset.py` script or the GAPS executable.
    - Unexpected behavior or errors during dataset creation.
    - In a successful exploit scenario, arbitrary code execution, which is harder to detect directly via automated testing but should be the focus of manual analysis after identifying potential code execution vulnerabilities through source code review.
  - Step 5: Examine the system for any signs of compromise or unauthorized activity. In a real-world scenario, successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system takeover. For testing purposes, focus on detecting crashes or unexpected behavior as indicators of a potential vulnerability. Deeper analysis would involve using security tools to detect memory corruption or other signs of exploitation.
