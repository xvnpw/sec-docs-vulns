### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in `meshes2dataset.py`

- **Description:**
    The `meshes2dataset.py` script utilizes external GAPS utilities for mesh processing. The script processes a user-provided mesh directory and uses filenames from this directory to construct shell commands executed by GAPS utilities. Due to the lack of sanitization of these filenames, a command injection vulnerability exists.

    Step-by-step description of how to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious mesh filename containing shell command injection payloads. For example, a filename could be `mesh_` followed by backticks or dollar signs and parentheses enclosing a malicious command, like `mesh_`\`touch /tmp/pwned\`.ply or `mesh_$(touch /tmp/pwned).ply`.
    2. The attacker places this maliciously named mesh file within a directory structure that mimics the expected input format for `meshes2dataset.py`, such as `malicious_meshes/train/pwned_class/`.
    3. The attacker executes the `meshes2dataset.py` script, providing the `malicious_meshes` directory as the `--mesh_directory` argument.
    4. When `meshes2dataset.py` processes the malicious file, the filename is used to construct shell commands within the `process_mesh_local.sh` script. Specifically, within the `process_mesh_local.sh` script, variables derived from the malicious filename are incorporated into commands like `${gaps}/msh2msh $mesh_orig $mesh ...`.
    5. Because the filenames are not sanitized, the shell interprets the malicious commands embedded within the filename and executes them. In the example filename, `touch /tmp/pwned` would be executed on the server.

- **Impact:**
    Critical. A successful command injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the `meshes2dataset.py` script.

    Impact Breakdown:
    - **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the server, potentially installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, or further exploiting the system.
    - **Data Theft:** Sensitive data stored on the server, including datasets, trained models, or other confidential information, can be stolen.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can launch DoS attacks, disrupting the service by crashing the system or consuming resources.
    - **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues and potential disruption of research or applications relying on this project.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
    Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The provided code does not include any input sanitization or command injection prevention mechanisms in the `meshes2dataset.py` script or related shell scripts. Filenames from user-supplied directories are directly used in shell commands without any form of escaping or validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization within `meshes2dataset.py` to validate and sanitize filenames obtained from the `--mesh_directory`. This should include removing or escaping shell metacharacters before filenames are used in shell commands. Libraries like `shlex` in Python can be used for proper command-line escaping when constructing shell commands programmatically.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Commands:** Instead of constructing shell commands by string concatenation, utilize parameterized command execution methods that prevent shell injection. However, directly parameterizing shell commands in `bash` can be complex and error-prone.
    - **Safer Alternatives to Shell Execution:** Replace the use of shell scripts and GAPS utilities called via shell commands with safer alternatives. Explore Python libraries or GAPS Python bindings (if available and secure) to perform mesh processing directly within Python code, avoiding shell command execution entirely. If GAPS utilities must be used, investigate if they offer a safer API or command-line interface that avoids direct filename interpolation in shell commands.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** If shell command execution is unavoidable, ensure that the `meshes2dataset.py` script and GAPS utilities are executed with the minimal privileges necessary. This can limit the potential damage if command injection occurs. Consider running these processes within sandboxed environments or containers to further restrict their access to the system.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Attacker-Controlled Mesh Directory Path:** An attacker must be able to specify the mesh directory path that `meshes2dataset.py` will process via the `--mesh_directory` command-line argument. This is a standard and expected usage of the script, so it is easily achievable.
    - **Maliciously Crafted Filenames:** The attacker needs to create or upload mesh files with filenames designed to inject shell commands into the input mesh directory. An external attacker with access to the file system (even indirectly via a web interface or shared filesystem, if applicable in a broader context) could create these files. For a direct attack on a publicly available instance of the project, an attacker might need to find a way to stage these files if direct file system access is not available. However, in many scenarios, assuming an external attacker can influence files processed by the script is a reasonable threat model.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Entry Point: `meshes2dataset.py`**: The script begins by parsing command-line arguments, including `--mesh_directory` and `--dataset_directory`.
    ```python
    flags.DEFINE_string('mesh_directory', '', 'Path to meshes...')
    ```
    2. **Mesh File Discovery**: The script uses `glob.glob` to find mesh files within the provided directory:
    ```python
    files = glob.glob(f'{mesh_directory}/*/*/*.ply')
    ```
    This step is where the script gathers filenames that become vulnerable if they are maliciously crafted.
    3. **Processing Each Mesh**: The `process_one` function is called for each discovered mesh file.
    ```python
    output_dirs = Parallel(n_jobs=n_jobs)(
        delayed(process_one)(f, mesh_directory, FLAGS.dataset_directory,
                             FLAGS.skip_existing, FLAGS.log_level) for f in tqdm.tqdm(files))
    ```
    4. **`process_one` Function**: This function extracts the relative path and calls `make_example.mesh_to_example`.
    ```python
    def process_one(f, mesh_directory, dataset_directory, skip_existing, log_level):
        relpath = f.replace(mesh_directory, '')
        ...
        output_dir = f'{dataset_directory}/{split}/{synset}/{name}/'
        ...
        make_example.mesh_to_example(
            os.path.join(path_util.get_path_to_ldif_parent(), 'ldif'), f,
            f'{dataset_directory}/{split}/{synset}/{name}/', skip_existing, log_level)
        return output_dir
    ```
    5. **`make_example.mesh_to_example`**: This function, in turn, executes the shell script `process_mesh_local.sh`.
    ```python
    # File: /code/ldif/scripts/make_example.py
    def mesh_to_example(...):
        ...
        sp.check_output(
          f'{codebase_root_dir}/scripts/process_mesh_local.sh {mesh_path} {dirpath} {ldif_path}',
            shell=True)
        ...
    ```
    6. **Vulnerable Shell Script: `process_mesh_local.sh`**: This script uses variables derived from the mesh filename (specifically, `$mesh_in` which is based on `mesh_path` passed from `meshes2dataset.py`) directly in shell commands without sanitization.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ...
    mesh_in=$1 # Unsanitized filename from meshes2dataset.py
    outdir=$2
    ldif_root=$3
    ...
    mesh_orig=${outdir}/mesh_orig.${mesh_in##*.} # Unsafe filename expansion
    ln -s $mesh_in $mesh_orig # Symlink creation, potentially using unsafe filename
    ...
    ${gaps}/msh2msh $mesh_orig $mesh -scale_by_pca ... # Command injection vulnerability
    ```
    The line `${gaps}/msh2msh $mesh_orig $mesh -scale_by_pca ...` is a prime example of the vulnerability. If `$mesh_orig` contains malicious shell commands, they will be executed when this line is interpreted by `bash`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Environment:** Ensure you have the LDIF environment set up as described in the `README.md`.
    2. **Create Malicious Mesh Filename:** Create a file named `test$(touch /tmp/ldif_pwned).ply`. This filename includes a command injection payload: `touch /tmp/ldif_pwned`.
    3. **Prepare Malicious Mesh Directory:** Create the directory `malicious_meshes/train/pwned_class/` and place the malicious file `test$(touch /tmp/ldif_pwned).ply` inside it.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p malicious_meshes/train/pwned_class/
    touch malicious_meshes/train/pwned_class/'test$(touch /tmp/ldif_pwned).ply'
    ```
    4. **Run `meshes2dataset.py`**: Execute the `meshes2dataset.py` script, providing the `malicious_meshes` directory as input:
    ```bash
    python meshes2dataset.py --mesh_directory malicious_meshes --dataset_directory output_dataset --log_level verbose
    ```
    5. **Verify Command Execution:** After the script completes, check if the file `/tmp/ldif_pwned` has been created.
    ```bash
    ls /tmp/ldif_pwned
    ```
    If the file `/tmp/ldif_pwned` exists, this confirms that the command injection was successful. The `touch /tmp/ldif_pwned` command embedded in the filename was executed by the shell during the processing of `meshes2dataset.py`.
    6. **Cleanup:** Remove the created test files and directories:
    ```bash
    rm -rf malicious_meshes output_dataset /tmp/ldif_pwned
    ```
    This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands by crafting malicious filenames processed by `meshes2dataset.py`.
