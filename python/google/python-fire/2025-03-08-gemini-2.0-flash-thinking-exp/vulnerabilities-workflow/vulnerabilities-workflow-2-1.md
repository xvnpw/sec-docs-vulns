- vulnerability name: Command Injection via Unsafe `eval` in Argument Parsing
- description:
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary Python code through command-line arguments due to the use of `ast.literal_eval` in `fire.parser.DefaultParseValue`.
    - The `DefaultParseValue` function uses `ast.literal_eval` to parse command-line arguments, which, while intended for literal values, can be bypassed to execute arbitrary Python code if the input string is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in `ast.literal_eval` or due to misconfiguration.
    - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious command-line argument that contains Python code disguised as a literal. For example, an argument like `'[__import__("os").system("malicious_command")]'` or `'{__import__("os").system("malicious_command"):"a"}'`.
    - Step 2: When Python Fire parses the command-line arguments using `fire.Fire()`, the vulnerable `DefaultParseValue` function is invoked to process the malicious argument.
    - Step 3: `ast.literal_eval` attempts to evaluate the argument. Due to the complexity of `ast.literal_eval` and potential bypasses, or if the developer uses Fire in unintended ways, the injected Python code gets executed.
    - Step 4: The attacker's injected code, which could be arbitrary Python commands like `os.system` or `subprocess.run`, is executed by the Python interpreter.
- impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the server or machine running the Python Fire application.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project relies on `ast.literal_eval` for argument parsing, which is inherently vulnerable if not used with extreme caution and if bypasses are found.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters and code constructs before passing arguments to `ast.literal_eval`.
    - Use safe argument parsing: Replace `ast.literal_eval` with a safer parsing mechanism that strictly validates input against expected formats and prevents code execution. Consider using `json.loads` with specific options or a custom parser that only allows predefined literal types and structures.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If arbitrary code execution is a potential risk, consider running the Python Fire application in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
- preconditions:
    - The application must be using Python Fire to create a CLI.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the Python Fire application.
- source code analysis:
    - File: /code/fire/parser.py
    - Function: `DefaultParseValue(value)`
    ```python
    def DefaultParseValue(value):
        """The default argument parsing function used by Fire CLIs.

        ...
        """
        # Note: _LiteralEval will treat '#' as the start of a comment.
        try:
            return _LiteralEval(value) # Vulnerable function
        except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
            # If _LiteralEval can't parse the value, treat it as a string.
            return value

    def _LiteralEval(value):
        """Parse value as a Python literal, or container of containers and literals.
        ...
        """
        root = ast.parse(value, mode='eval') # Parsing user input as AST
        ...
        return ast.literal_eval(root) # Evaluating AST, potential injection point
    ```
    - The `DefaultParseValue` function in `/code/fire/parser.py` uses `ast.literal_eval` to parse the input `value`.
    - `ast.literal_eval` is intended for safely evaluating literal expressions, but it's known to have bypasses or can be misused in ways that lead to code execution, especially when combined with string manipulation or unexpected input.
    - By crafting a malicious string, an attacker can potentially inject code that `ast.literal_eval` will execute.
- security test case:
    - Step 1: Create a Python file `test_vuln.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    import fire

    def test(command):
        return command

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        fire.Fire(test)
    ```
    - Step 2: Run the Python file `test_vuln.py` from the command line with a malicious argument designed to execute code using `ast.literal_eval` bypass:
    ```bash
    python test_vuln.py test '[__import__("os").system("whoami")]'
    ```
    - Expected Result: The command `whoami` should be executed on the system. The output of `whoami` will be printed to the console, demonstrating arbitrary command execution. Depending on the environment and permissions, more harmful commands could be executed.
