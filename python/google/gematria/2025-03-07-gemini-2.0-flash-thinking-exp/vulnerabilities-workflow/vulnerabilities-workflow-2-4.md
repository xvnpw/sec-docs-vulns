Okay, please provide the vulnerability list, and I will process it according to your instructions. I will analyze each vulnerability description and determine if it meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria you've outlined.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Evaluate each vulnerability** against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2.  **Filter out vulnerabilities** that do not meet the requirements.
3.  **Format the remaining vulnerabilities** in markdown with the requested sections: vulnerability name, description, impact, vulnerability rank, currently implemented mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and security test case.
4.  **Return the formatted list** or an empty list if no vulnerabilities meet the criteria.

Looking forward to receiving the vulnerability list!
