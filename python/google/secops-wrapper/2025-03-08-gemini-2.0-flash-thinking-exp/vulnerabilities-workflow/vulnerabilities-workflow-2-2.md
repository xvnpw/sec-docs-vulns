- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Service Account Keys via `service_account_info`

- Description:
  1. The SDK's `README.md` provides examples for authenticating using a service account, including passing service account credentials as a dictionary (`service_account_info`).
  2. This method, while functional, encourages developers to potentially hardcode sensitive service account keys directly within their application code or configuration files.
  3. If a developer follows the example and embeds the service account key dictionary directly into their source code or stores it in a publicly accessible configuration file (e.g., committed to a public repository, stored in a world-readable file system), the private key component of the service account could be exposed.
  4. An attacker who gains access to the source code repository or the insecurely stored configuration file can extract the service account private key.
  5. With the compromised service account key, the attacker can authenticate to the Google Security Operations Chronicle API as the legitimate service account.
  6. This unauthorized access allows the attacker to perform actions within the victim's Chronicle instance, such as viewing security logs, running queries, and potentially exfiltrating sensitive security data, depending on the permissions granted to the compromised service account.

- Impact:
  - Credential Compromise: Exposure of service account private keys.
  - Unauthorized Access: Attackers gain unauthorized access to the victim's Google Security Operations Chronicle instance.
  - Data Breach: Potential exfiltration of sensitive security logs and data from Chronicle.
  - Security Monitoring Bypass: Attackers could potentially disable or tamper with security monitoring within the Chronicle instance, hindering incident response and detection capabilities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the code itself.
  - The `README.md` mentions Application Default Credentials (ADC) as the "simplest and recommended way to authenticate," which implicitly suggests a more secure alternative. However, it does not explicitly warn against the insecure use of `service_account_info`.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Explicit Security Warning in Documentation: The `README.md` and any related authentication documentation should include a clear and prominent warning against hardcoding or insecurely storing service account keys, especially when using the `service_account_info` and `service_account_path` methods.
  - Best Practice Recommendations: Documentation should strongly recommend using secure methods for managing service account credentials, such as:
    - Application Default Credentials (ADC) when possible.
    - Secure secret management services (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store and retrieve service account keys.
    - Environment variables for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to securely stored key files, with proper file system permissions.
  - Input Validation (Low impact mitigation): While not directly preventing insecure storage, the SDK could potentially include basic validation to check if `service_account_info` is being passed directly as a string literal in code (though this is difficult and might lead to false positives).

- Preconditions:
  - The user chooses to authenticate using the Service Account method.
  - The user utilizes the `service_account_info` or `service_account_path` method.
  - The user insecurely stores the service account key, for example, by hardcoding the `service_account_info` dictionary directly into their application code or committing it to a version control system.
  - An attacker gains access to the insecurely stored service account key (e.g., via access to the source code repository, configuration files, or compromised environment).

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/secops/auth.py`
  - The `SecOpsAuth` class in `/code/src/secops/auth.py` is responsible for handling authentication.
  - The `__init__` method of `SecOpsAuth` accepts `service_account_info` as an optional parameter:
    ```python
    class SecOpsAuth:
        def __init__(
            self,
            credentials: Optional[Credentials] = None,
            service_account_path: Optional[str] = None,
            service_account_info: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
            scopes: Optional[List[str]] = None
        ):
            # ...
            self.credentials = self._get_credentials(
                credentials,
                service_account_path,
                service_account_info
            )
    ```
  - The `_get_credentials` method in `SecOpsAuth` handles the logic for loading credentials from `service_account_info`:
    ```python
    def _get_credentials(
        self,
        credentials: Optional[Credentials],
        service_account_path: Optional[str],
        service_account_info: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> Credentials:
        # ...
        if service_account_info:
            return service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
                service_account_info,
                scopes=self.scopes
            )
        # ...
    ```
  - The code correctly uses the `google-auth` library to load credentials from the provided `service_account_info` dictionary.
  - **Vulnerability Point:** The code itself does not introduce the vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the *usage* pattern encouraged by the documentation, where users might directly provide the sensitive `service_account_info` dictionary in their code without proper security considerations for storing the private key contained within.
  - The `README.md` example directly shows how to initialize the client with `service_account_info`:
    ```python
    service_account_info = {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "your-project-id",
        "private_key_id": "key-id",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...", # <--- Private Key Here
        "client_email": "service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        # ... other fields
    }

    client = SecOpsClient(service_account_info=service_account_info)
    ```
  - This example, while demonstrating the functionality, can mislead developers into believing that hardcoding the `service_account_info` dictionary is an acceptable practice, leading to the insecure storage of sensitive private keys.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a Python script named `test_insecure_key.py`.
  2. In `test_insecure_key.py`, hardcode a placeholder service account JSON dictionary into the `service_account_info` parameter when initializing `SecOpsClient`.  Use a dummy private key for demonstration purposes; do not use a real, sensitive key.
     ```python
     from secops import SecOpsClient

     service_account_info = {
         "type": "service_account",
         "project_id": "your-project-id", # Replace with a dummy project ID
         "private_key_id": "dummy-key-id",
         "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n-----DUMMY PRIVATE KEY-----\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n", # Insecurely hardcoded private key
         "client_email": "service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com", # Replace with a dummy email
         "client_id": "dummy-client-id",
         "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
         "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
         "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
         "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/dummy"
     }

     client = SecOpsClient(service_account_info=service_account_info)
     chronicle = client.chronicle(
         customer_id="your-chronicle-instance-id", # Replace with a dummy customer ID
         project_id="your-project-id" # Replace with a dummy project ID
     )

     print("SecOps Client initialized (insecurely).")
     # In a real scenario, an attacker gaining access to this script
     # would have access to the 'service_account_info' dictionary.
     # For demonstration, we'll just print the dictionary (in a real test, avoid printing sensitive info).
     import pprint
     print("\nInsecurely stored service_account_info dictionary:")
     pprint.pprint(service_account_info)
     ```
  3.  **Manual Review/Demonstration (No automated test possible for this type of vulnerability):**  Explain that if this `test_insecure_key.py` script were committed to a public repository or stored insecurely on a system, an attacker who gained access to it could directly read the `service_account_info` dictionary, including the `private_key`.
  4.  **Demonstrate Extraction (Manual Step):**  Show how easily an attacker could copy the `service_account_info` dictionary from the script.
  5.  **Explain Potential Exploit:** Describe how, with the extracted `service_account_info`, an attacker could then use the Google Cloud SDK or another tool to authenticate as this service account and potentially access the victim's Chronicle instance (assuming they have network access and the necessary tools).  Emphasize that while this test case doesn't *automatically* exploit a live Chronicle instance (due to the placeholder key), it clearly demonstrates the vulnerability and ease of credential extraction due to insecure storage encouraged by the example.
  6.  **Mitigation Demonstration (Conceptual):** Explain how using ADC or storing the service account key file securely and using `service_account_path` or environment variables would mitigate this risk.  Highlight that the vulnerability is not in the SDK code itself, but in the *insecure usage* that the documentation example could inadvertently promote.
