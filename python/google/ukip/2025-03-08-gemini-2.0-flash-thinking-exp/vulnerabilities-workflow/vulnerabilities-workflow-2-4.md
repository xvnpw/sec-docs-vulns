- vulnerability name: Insufficient Keystroke Injection Detection due to High Abnormal Typing Threshold
  - description: If a user misconfigures the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold to a value that is too high, the daemon will fail to detect fast keystroke injection attacks. This is because the daemon relies on comparing the inter-keystroke timings against this threshold to identify suspicious typing speeds. When the threshold is set too high, even rapid injection attacks can fall within the acceptable range and be classified as benign, thus bypassing the intended protection.
  - impact: A successful keystroke injection attack can have severe consequences, including arbitrary command execution, unauthorized access to sensitive information, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or complete system compromise. The attacker's ability to inject commands as if typed by a legitimate user allows them to bypass normal security controls and gain control over the affected system.
  - vulnerability rank: Medium
  - currently implemented mitigations:
    - Default Value: The `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable is pre-set to `50000` in both `setup.sh` and `src/ukip.py`. This value is described in `README.md` as a "safe default" based on internal observations.
    - Documentation and Warnings: The `README.md` file explicitly warns users about the importance of correctly configuring the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable. It details that setting the value too high increases the risk of false negatives (missing real attacks), while setting it too low increases false positives (blocking legitimate typing). It recommends adjusting this value based on the user's typing speed and experience.
  - missing mitigations:
    - Automatic Calibration or Guidance: The project lacks an automatic or guided calibration process to help users determine an appropriate `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold for their specific typing speed. A setup wizard or script that measures the user's typical typing speed and suggests a threshold based on that could significantly improve security and usability.
    - Input Validation and Range Limits: There is no input validation or range limitation for the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable. Users can set arbitrarily high values, effectively disabling the intended protection. Implementing validation to enforce a reasonable upper limit or warn users about excessively high values could prevent misconfigurations that weaken security.
    - Security Test Case for Threshold Sensitivity: The project's test suite (`src/ukip_test.py`) does not include a specific security test case to verify the effectiveness of the daemon under different `ABNORMAL_TYPING` thresholds. A dedicated test case that attempts to bypass the detection with slightly elevated `ABNORMAL_TYPING` values would help ensure the robustness of the protection and highlight the risks of misconfiguration.
  - preconditions:
    - User Misconfiguration: The user must manually modify the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable in `setup.sh` before installation or directly in `src/ukip.py` after installation, setting it to a value significantly higher than appropriate for typical typing speeds.
  - source code analysis:
    - `src/ukip.py`:
      - The `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable is initialized with a default value: `ABNORMAL_TYPING = 50000`.
      - The `check_for_attack` function is responsible for detecting potential keystroke injection attacks.
      - Within `check_for_attack`, the code iterates through the `_event_devices_timings` ring buffer to compare inter-keystroke times.
      - The core logic for attack detection is the comparison: `if value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING:`.  If the time difference between consecutive keystrokes is less than or equal to `ABNORMAL_TYPING`, it is counted as a potential attack indicator.
      - If the `attack_counter` reaches `KEYSTROKE_WINDOW - 1`, it signifies that a sequence of keystrokes has been typed with inter-keystroke times below or equal to the threshold, triggering either `enforce_monitor_mode` or `enforce_hardening_mode` based on the configured `_UKIP_RUN_MODE`.

      ```python
      def check_for_attack(event_device_path: Text, device: usb.core.Device) -> bool:
          # ...
          with _event_devices_lock:
              # ...
              attack_counter = 0
              reversed_buffer = reversed(_event_devices_timings[event_device_path])
              for value in reversed_buffer:
                  for prev in reversed_buffer:
                      if value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING: # Vulnerability: Threshold check
                          attack_counter += 1
                      value = prev
                  break
          if attack_counter == KEYSTROKE_WINDOW - 1:
              if _UKIP_RUN_MODE == UKIP_AVAILABLE_MODES.MONITOR:
                  enforce_monitor_mode(device, event_device_path)
              elif _UKIP_RUN_MODE == UKIP_AVAILABLE_MODES.HARDENING:
                  enforce_hardening_mode(device, event_device_path)
              # ...
      ```
      - If `ABNORMAL_TYPING` is set to an excessively large value (e.g., 1000000 milliseconds or 1 second), the condition `value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING` will likely be true for almost any inter-keystroke time, including those from rapid keystroke injection attacks. This effectively disables the intended attack detection mechanism, as the `attack_counter` will rarely reach the threshold to trigger blocking or monitoring.

    - `setup.sh`:
      - The `setup.sh` script allows users to modify the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable before installation using the `NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable.
      - It uses `sed` to replace the default value in `src/ukip.py` with the user-provided value.
      - There is no validation or restriction on the value of `NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING` in `setup.sh`.

      ```bash
      NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING=50000 # User configurable variable

      # ...

      function replace_variables() {
          sed -i 's/ABNORMAL_TYPING = [^0-9]*\([0-9]\+\)/ABNORMAL_TYPING = '$NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING'/g' src/ukip.py
          # ...
      }
      ```

  - security test case:
    1.  **Environment Setup:**
        - Prepare a Linux system where UKIP can be installed.
        - Modify the `setup.sh` file before running it. Locate the line `NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING=50000` and change the value to a high number, for example, `NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING=1000000`.
        - Run `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh` to install UKIP with the modified configuration.
        - Ensure the UKIP service is running: `systemctl status ukip.service`.
    2.  **Attack Simulation:**
        - Use a USB keystroke injection device (e.g., a programmable USB rubber ducky or a similar tool).
        - Program the device to inject a simple payload, such as the command `date > /tmp/attack.txt\n`. This command will write the current date and time to a file named `attack.txt` in the `/tmp` directory. Set the injection speed to be fast but within a range that might be considered "normal" if the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold is very high. For instance, set an inter-keystroke delay of 10 milliseconds (10000 microseconds) between each character of the payload.
        - Plug the programmed USB keystroke injection device into the test system. The payload will be automatically injected as keystrokes.
    3.  **Verification:**
        - Check for Attack Detection Logs (Monitor Mode): If UKIP is running in `MONITOR` mode, examine the system logs (e.g., using `journalctl -u ukip.service` or checking `/dev/log` or syslog files) for any warnings or log entries indicating a detected keystroke injection attack.
        - Check for Device Blocking (Hardening Mode): If UKIP is running in `HARDENING` mode, verify if the USB device was ejected from the system. You can check the output of `lsusb` or `udevadm monitor` to see if the device is no longer listed after the injection attempt.
        - Check for Payload Execution: Examine the `/tmp` directory for the presence of the `attack.txt` file. If the file exists and contains the current date and time, it confirms that the keystroke injection attack was successful and the command was executed.
    4.  **Expected Results:**
        - With a high `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold (e.g., 1000000), the injected keystrokes are likely to be classified as benign.
        - In `MONITOR` mode, no warnings or attack detection logs should be generated in the system logs.
        - In `HARDENING` mode, the USB device should **not** be ejected.
        - The `attack.txt` file should be created in `/tmp`, indicating successful payload execution.
    5.  **Success and Vulnerability Confirmation:** If the expected results are observed (no detection or blocking, and successful payload execution), it confirms the vulnerability. The high `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold allowed the keystroke injection attack to bypass UKIP's protection mechanism.
