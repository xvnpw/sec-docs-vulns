### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Slow Keystroke Injection Bypass
- Description:
  - An attacker can bypass the USB keystroke injection protection by injecting keystrokes at a speed and interval that mimics normal human typing patterns.
  - This can be achieved by ensuring that the inter-arrival time between keystrokes stays just above the configured `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold.
  - By doing so, the attack will not be detected as abnormal typing, and the malicious USB device will not be ejected.
  - Step-by-step trigger:
    1. Attacker connects a USB keystroke injection device to a Linux system protected by UKIP.
    2. Attacker configures the injection device to send keystrokes with inter-arrival times slightly greater than the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold set in UKIP's configuration (e.g., if `ABNORMAL_TYPING` is 50000 microseconds, inject with intervals of 51000 microseconds).
    3. Attacker injects a sequence of malicious commands (e.g., `rm -rf /tmp/malicious_dir`).
    4. The UKIP daemon monitors keystroke timings but, because the inter-arrival times are above the threshold, does not classify the typing as abnormal.
    5. The malicious commands are executed by the system as if typed by a legitimate user.
    6. The USB keystroke injection device remains connected and undetected.
- Impact:
  - Successful bypass allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.
  - This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Installation of malware.
    - System configuration changes.
    - Denial of service (if the injected commands are designed to disrupt system operations, although this specific vulnerability description excludes DoS as per instructions).
    - Privilege escalation (depending on the commands injected and user privileges).
  - The impact is significant as it undermines the core purpose of the UKIP tool, which is to prevent keystroke injection attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Configurable `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold: Users can adjust the sensitivity of the detection by modifying the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` variable in `src/ukip.py` or via `setup.sh`. This is mentioned in `setup.sh` and `README.md`.
  - Location: `setup.sh` replaces the default value in `src/ukip.py` during installation.
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/ABNORMAL_TYPING = [^0-9]*\([0-9]\+\)/ABNORMAL_TYPING = '$NEW_ABNORMAL_TYPING'/g' src/ukip.py
  ```
  - However, this mitigation relies on the user correctly identifying and setting an appropriate threshold, which is challenging and prone to error.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement more sophisticated detection methods beyond simple inter-arrival time thresholds. This could include:
    - Typing pattern analysis: Analyze the statistical distribution of inter-keystroke timings, digraph frequencies, or other typing characteristics to distinguish between human and injected typing.
    - Frequency analysis of keystrokes: Detect unusual bursts of keystrokes even if they are slightly slower than the threshold.
    - Machine learning models: Train a model on normal user typing patterns to identify anomalies that could indicate injection attacks.
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment: Automatically adjust the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold based on observed user behavior over time, instead of relying on a static configuration.
  - Rate limiting or throttling of input events: Even if not classified as malicious, an unusually high volume of input events from a single device within a short period could trigger suspicion and further analysis or temporary device blocking.
- Preconditions:
  - Physical access to the target Linux system.
  - Ability to connect a USB keystroke injection device.
  - `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold configured to a value that is not sufficiently low to detect slow injection attacks without causing false positives for normal users. The default value of `50000` (microseconds) might be too high for some users, but lowering it too much could lead to false positives.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability lies in the `check_for_attack` function in `src/ukip.py`.
  - The function calculates `attack_counter` based on consecutive keystroke timings within the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold.
  ```python
  def check_for_attack(event_device_path: Text, device: usb.core.Device) -> bool:
      # ...
      with _event_devices_lock:
          if len(_event_devices_timings[event_device_path]) < KEYSTROKE_WINDOW:
              return False

          attack_counter = 0

          # Count the number of adjacent keystrokes below (or equal) the
          # ABNORMAL_TYPING.
          reversed_buffer = reversed(_event_devices_timings[event_device_path])
          for value in reversed_buffer:
              for prev in reversed_buffer:
                  if value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING: # Vulnerability: Only checks if *less than or equal* to threshold, slow typing bypasses this.
                      attack_counter += 1
                  value = prev
              break  # Exit after the first backward iteratation.

      # If all the timings in the ringbuffer are within the ABNORMAL_TYPING timing.
      if attack_counter == KEYSTROKE_WINDOW - 1:
          if _UKIP_RUN_MODE == UKIP_AVAILABLE_MODES.MONITOR:
              enforce_monitor_mode(device, event_device_path)
          elif _UKIP_RUN_MODE == UKIP_AVAILABLE_MODES.HARDENING:
              enforce_hardening_mode(device, event_device_path)
          else:
              log.error('No run mode was specified for UKIP. Exiting...')
              return False
  ```
  - The core logic checks if `value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING`. This condition is met even if the inter-arrival time is slightly *greater* than a normal typing speed but still above the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold.
  - For example, if `ABNORMAL_TYPING` is 50000 microseconds (50ms), and an attacker injects keystrokes with a 60ms interval, the `value - prev` will be greater than 50000, and the `attack_counter` will not reach `KEYSTROKE_WINDOW - 1` if the intervals consistently stay above the threshold, thus bypassing the detection.
  - Visualization: Imagine a timeline of keystrokes. UKIP looks at a window of the last `KEYSTROKE_WINDOW` keystrokes. If all inter-arrival times within this window are less than or equal to `ABNORMAL_TYPING`, it flags an attack.  If the attacker keeps the inter-arrival times slightly above `ABNORMAL_TYPING`, the condition `value - prev <= ABNORMAL_TYPING` will not consistently be true for all keystrokes in the window, and the attack will go undetected.

- Security Test Case:
  - Prerequisites:
    - A Linux system with UKIP installed in HARDENING mode.
    - A USB keystroke injection device (e.g., a programmable USB rubber ducky or similar).
    - Network access to the test system (for observing command execution if it involves network activity).
  - Steps:
    1. Install UKIP on a test machine following the instructions in `README.md`. Ensure UKIP is running in `HARDENING` mode (set `RUN_MODE=HARDENING` in `setup.sh` before running it). Use the default `ABNORMAL_TYPING` value (50000 microseconds) initially.
    2. Connect to the test machine via SSH or a local terminal to monitor command execution.
    3. Prepare a simple malicious command to inject, for example, `touch /tmp/ukip_bypass_test`. This command will create a file in the `/tmp/` directory, which can be easily verified.
    4. Program the USB keystroke injection device to inject the command `touch /tmp/ukip_bypass_test` followed by the ENTER key. Configure the injection speed such that the inter-keystroke delay is slightly above the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold. For example, set a delay of 60 milliseconds (60000 microseconds) between each keystroke.
    5. Plug the programmed USB keystroke injection device into the test machine.
    6. Observe the system. Check if the file `/tmp/ukip_bypass_test` is created. You can use the command `ls /tmp/ukip_bypass_test` in the terminal.
    7. Check the system logs (e.g., using `journalctl -u ukip.service`) to confirm that UKIP did *not* detect an attack and did *not* eject the USB device. Look for any warning or error messages related to device ejection.
    8. If the file `/tmp/ukip_bypass_test` is created and UKIP logs do not indicate device ejection or attack detection, the slow keystroke injection bypass vulnerability is confirmed.
    9. To further verify, repeat the test with faster injection speeds that are below the `ABNORMAL_TYPING` threshold. In this case, UKIP should detect the attack and eject the device (in HARDENING mode), and the file should ideally *not* be created (or the command execution might be interrupted by device ejection).
