### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Key File Deletion
- Description:
    1. The script creates and downloads a service account key file to the user's Cloud Shell environment.
    2. After prompting the user to download the key, the script attempts to delete the key file from the Cloud Shell environment using the `shred -u` command.
    3. The `shred -u` command is intended to securely delete files by overwriting them multiple times before unlinking.
    4. However, the effectiveness of `shred -u` depends on the underlying file system and system utilities available in the Cloud Shell environment.
    5. In certain scenarios or file systems, `shred -u` might not be available, function as expected, or completely remove the file data, leaving remnants of the key file on disk.
    6. If the secure deletion fails, the service account key file may persist in the Cloud Shell environment even after the script completes.
    7. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Shell environment after the script execution (e.g., through compromised credentials or other means) could potentially recover the undeleted service account key file.
- Impact:
    - If the service account key file is not securely deleted, and an attacker gains access to the Cloud Shell environment, they can retrieve the private key.
    - With the private key, the attacker can impersonate the service account.
    - Depending on the scopes authorized for the service account, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive Google Workspace data and resources, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The script attempts to delete the key file using the `shred -u` command in the `delete_key()` function in `gwmme_create_service_account.py`, `gwm_create_service_account.py`, and `password_sync_create_service_account.py`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Verification of successful key file deletion after running `shred -u`. The script does not check the return code or output of the `shred` command to confirm if the deletion was successful.
    - Implement fallback mechanisms or alternative secure deletion methods if `shred -u` fails or is not available in the Cloud Shell environment.
    - Provide a clear warning to the user about the importance of securing their Cloud Shell environment and manually verifying the deletion of the key file, especially if they suspect `shred -u` might have failed.
- Preconditions:
    - The script must be executed successfully, leading to the creation and download of the service account key.
    - The `shred -u` command must fail to securely delete the key file in the Cloud Shell environment. This could be due to various reasons, such as `shred` not being available, file system limitations, or errors during execution.
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Cloud Shell environment *after* the script has been executed and the key file deletion was attempted but failed.
- Source code analysis:
    - In each of the scripts (`gwmme_create_service_account.py`, `gwm_create_service_account.py`, `password_sync_create_service_account.py`), the `delete_key()` function is responsible for deleting the key file.
    - Example from `gwmme_create_service_account.py`:
    ```python
    async def delete_key():
      input("\nPress Enter after you have downloaded the file.")
      logging.debug(f"Deleting key file ${KEY_FILE}...")
      command = f"shred -u {KEY_FILE}"
      await retryable_command(command)
    ```
    - The script executes the `shred -u {KEY_FILE}` command using `retryable_command`.
    - `retryable_command` checks for a zero return code to indicate success but doesn't specifically verify if `shred -u` actually performed a secure deletion. It primarily checks if the command executed without system errors.
    - If `shred -u` fails to securely delete the file for any reason (e.g., due to file system limitations, permissions, or command unavailability), but still returns a zero exit code (which is unlikely for command not found, but possible in other failure scenarios depending on how `shred` is implemented in the environment), the script will proceed without any indication of deletion failure.
    - There is no error handling or verification to confirm that the key file is actually securely deleted after the `shred -u` command is executed.
- Security test case:
    1. **Modify the script:** Edit one of the Python scripts (e.g., `gwmme_create_service_account.py`) to simulate a scenario where `shred -u` command fails to delete the file securely. To do this, replace the line `command = f"shred -u {KEY_FILE}"` with `command = f"touch /tmp/shred_failed && rm -f {KEY_FILE}"`. This command will create a file `/tmp/shred_failed` (to ensure the command returns success) and attempt to delete the key file using `rm -f`, which is not secure deletion but simulates a failed secure deletion. Alternatively, you can simply comment out the line `command = f"shred -u {KEY_FILE}"` to prevent deletion altogether for testing purposes.
    2. **Run the modified script in Cloud Shell:** Open Google Cloud Shell and execute the modified script using the provided `curl` command from the README for the corresponding tool (GWMME, GWM, or Password Sync).
    3. **Complete the script execution:** Follow the prompts in the script and complete all steps, including authorizing the service account and waiting for the script to reach the key deletion phase.
    4. **Download the key file when prompted:** When the script prompts you to download the service account key, download it to your local machine.
    5. **Press Enter to continue deletion (simulated):** After downloading, press Enter in the Cloud Shell to proceed with the (simulated or bypassed) key file deletion process.
    6. **Verify key file existence in Cloud Shell:** After the script completes, open a new Cloud Shell session (to ensure you are in a fresh session after script execution). Navigate to the home directory (`cd ~`) and check if the key file (`{KEY_FILE}`) still exists. You can use the `ls -l` command and look for the key file name that was generated during the script execution.
    7. **Check for key file persistence:** If the key file is still present in the home directory after the script has run and supposedly deleted it, this confirms the "Insecure Key File Deletion" vulnerability. The simulated failure of `shred -u` (or bypassing it) resulted in the key file persisting on disk, demonstrating that the current deletion mechanism is not reliable under all circumstances.
