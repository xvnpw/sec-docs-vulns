* Vulnerability Name: Content Injection in Text Fields
* Description:
Developers using this library might directly embed unsanitized user input into the text fields of chat card widgets, such as `TextParagraph` or `DecoratedText`. When the `render()` method of the card or message is called, this unsanitized input is included in the generated JSON payload without any modification. If a malicious user provides input containing HTML or Markdown formatting, and the client application rendering the chat card does not sanitize this content, it can lead to content injection. For example, an attacker could inject malicious links, images, or styled text that could mislead or harm users viewing the chat card.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. A developer using the `python-card-framework` library constructs a chat card using widgets like `TextParagraph` or `DecoratedText`.
    2. The developer dynamically sets the `text` attribute of these widgets using user-provided input, without applying any sanitization or encoding.
    3. A malicious user provides input containing formatting codes (like Markdown or HTML if supported by the client) or malicious content (like phishing links).
    4. The developer's application renders the card using the library's `render()` method, which generates a JSON payload.
    5. This JSON payload, containing the unsanitized user input, is sent to the Google Chat API.
    6. The Google Chat client application receives the card data and renders it.
    7. If the client application does not sanitize or properly handle the formatting codes or malicious content within the text fields, the malicious formatting or content is rendered, leading to content injection.

* Impact:
Content injection can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Misleading users with fake information or manipulated content.
    - Phishing attacks by injecting malicious links that appear legitimate.
    - Defacement of chat cards.
    - Potential client-side script injection if the client application uses a web-based rendering engine and doesn't properly sanitize HTML (though less likely in typical chat card scenarios, but depends on client implementation).

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
This is ranked as medium because the severity depends on the rendering behavior of the Google Chat client application, which is outside the control of this library. However, the library facilitates the injection by not providing any built-in sanitization mechanisms, and the attack vector is directly related to the library's intended use case. If the Google Chat client is vulnerable to rendering injected content, the impact could be significant.

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. The project code does not implement any input sanitization or output encoding for text fields or any other fields that could be used to display user-provided content. The `standard_field` function in `card_framework/__init__.py` only sets up metadata for letter case conversion and conditional exclusion of fields, but not for security measures like sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
Input sanitization should be implemented for all text fields in widgets where user-provided content is expected to be displayed.

    Recommended mitigations include:
    - Context-Aware Output Encoding: Depending on the expected content format and the Google Chat client's rendering capabilities, apply appropriate output encoding. If Markdown is supported and expected, use a Markdown sanitization library to parse and sanitize user input before rendering it into the card. If only plain text is expected, HTML escaping might be sufficient to prevent HTML injection if the client attempts to render HTML.
    - Developer Guidance: Provide clear documentation and best practices for developers using this library, explicitly warning against directly embedding unsanitized user input into card text fields. Recommend sanitization and encoding techniques that developers should apply before using the library to generate card JSON.
    - Consider a Sanitization Option:  Potentially add an optional parameter to the `standard_field` or widget classes to enable automatic sanitization. This could be a configurable option that developers can turn on if they are handling user input in text fields.

* Preconditions:
    - A developer uses the `python-card-framework` library to construct Google Chat cards.
    - The developer incorporates user-controlled input into the text fields of card widgets (e.g., `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, `Chip`, `CardHeader`, etc.) without sanitizing this input.
    - The Google Chat client application used by end-users to view these chat cards is susceptible to rendering or executing injected content (e.g., HTML, Markdown, or other formatting codes).

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. Examine Widget Definitions:
    - Navigate to widget definition files, for example, `card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py` and `card_framework/v2/widgets/decorated_text.py`.
    - Observe the `TextParagraph` and `DecoratedText` classes. They both contain a `text: str = standard_field()` attribute.
    - Similarly, check other widgets like `Chip`, `Button`, `CardHeader`, `Section`, and other text-containing widgets across the `/code/card_framework/v2/widgets/` directory and other relevant files.

    2. Analyze `standard_field` Function:
    - Open `card_framework/__init__.py` and inspect the `standard_field` function.
    - Notice that `standard_field` primarily uses `dataclasses.field` and `dataclasses_json.config` to manage field metadata, such as `letter_case` and `exclude`.
    - Confirm that there is no sanitization or encoding logic within `standard_field` or any related functions. The metadata configurations are focused on JSON serialization formatting, not security.

    3. Trace Rendering Process:
    - In `card_framework/__init__.py`, examine the `Renderable` class and its `render()` method.
    - The `render()` method converts the Python dataclass objects into JSON dictionaries by calling `to_dict()`.
    - The `to_dict()` method is provided by `dataclasses_json` library and performs a direct serialization of the dataclass attributes to a dictionary, without any transformations or sanitization of the string content.

    4. Verify No Sanitization:
    - Conclude that as the data flows from widget attribute assignment to JSON rendering, there is no point where input sanitization or output encoding is applied to the text fields. The library is designed to faithfully represent the data provided by the developer in the JSON output.

    5. Visualization of Data Flow:

    ```
    [Developer Input (Unsanitized String)] --> Widget.text Attribute --> dataclasses.field (standard_field) --> dataclasses_json.to_dict() --> Rendered JSON Payload --> Google Chat API --> Google Chat Client (Potential Content Injection if Client is Vulnerable)
    ```

    This flow illustrates that unsanitized input from the developer is directly passed into the JSON payload rendered by the library, without any intermediate sanitization steps within the library itself.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup Test Environment:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed, as per `pyproject.toml`.
    - Install the library and its dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r /code/requirements.txt
      ```
    - Create a Python test script, e.g., `content_injection_test.py`.

    2. Construct Malicious Card:
    - In `content_injection_test.py`, import necessary classes from the library:
      ```python
      from card_framework.v2 import Card, CardHeader, Section
      from card_framework.v2.widgets import TextParagraph
      from card_framework.v2.message import Message
      ```
    - Create a `TextParagraph` widget and set its `text` to a malicious payload. For example, use Markdown for a malicious link and HTML for a script if you suspect HTML rendering vulnerability in the client:
      ```python
      malicious_markdown = "[Click for free prizes!](javascript:alert('Markdown Content Injection!'))" # Markdown payload
      malicious_html = "<a href='https://evil.com'>Click here</a><script>alert('HTML Content Injection!')</script>" # HTML payload
      text_widget_markdown = TextParagraph(text=malicious_markdown)
      text_widget_html = TextParagraph(text=malicious_html)
      ```
    - Create a section and card, adding the malicious text widget:
      ```python
      section_markdown = Section()
      section_markdown.add_widget(text_widget_markdown)
      section_html = Section()
      section_html.add_widget(text_widget_html)

      card_markdown = Card(header=CardHeader(title='Markdown Injection Test'), sections=[section_markdown])
      card_html = Card(header=CardHeader(title='HTML Injection Test'), sections=[section_html])
      ```
    - Create a message and add the card:
      ```python
      message_markdown = Message(cards=[card_markdown])
      message_html = Message(cards=[card_html])
      ```

    3. Render and Inspect JSON Payload:
    - Render the card to JSON format using `render()` method and print the output:
      ```python
      json_payload_markdown = message_markdown.render()
      json_payload_html = message_html.render()

      print("Markdown Payload JSON:")
      print(json_payload_markdown)
      print("\nHTML Payload JSON:")
      print(json_payload_html)
      ```
    - Inspect the output JSON. Verify that the `text` field in the `text_paragraph` widget contains the malicious payloads exactly as provided, without any sanitization or encoding. For example, for Markdown payload, you should see the raw Markdown string in the JSON.

    4. Simulate or Deploy to Google Chat (Conceptual):
    - To fully confirm the vulnerability, ideally, you would need to send this JSON payload to a Google Chat instance and observe how it renders in a chat client. If you have a Google Chat App development environment, you can attempt to send a message with this crafted card.
    - If direct deployment isn't feasible, you would need to conceptually analyze how a Google Chat client application would handle and render the JSON payload. Based on typical web application behavior, if the client naively renders text content from JSON without sanitization, Markdown or HTML (if supported) could be interpreted, leading to the injection. For Markdown, you might see a hyperlink rendered with "Click for free prizes!" that, when clicked, attempts to execute JavaScript. For HTML, you might see a hyperlink and potentially a JavaScript alert box if HTML is rendered without sanitization.

    5. Expected Outcome:
    - The test should demonstrate that the `python-card-framework` library does not sanitize text inputs. The JSON payload will contain the malicious content verbatim.
    - If the Google Chat client is vulnerable, rendering this card could result in the execution of the injected content (like the JavaScript alert from the HTML payload, or a misleading link from the Markdown payload). This would confirm the Content Injection vulnerability.
