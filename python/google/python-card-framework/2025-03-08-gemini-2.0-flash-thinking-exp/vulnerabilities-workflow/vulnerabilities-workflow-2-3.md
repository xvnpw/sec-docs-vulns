### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Text Injection in TextParagraph Widget
- Description:
  1. An attacker provides malicious text input to an application that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
  2. The application incorporates this unsanitized input into the `text` field of a `TextParagraph` widget.
  3. The application then uses the `python-card-framework` to render a Google Chat card containing this `TextParagraph` widget.
  4. When a user views the card in Google Chat, the malicious content from the `text` field is rendered without sanitization, potentially leading to phishing or other harmful actions.
- Impact: Users viewing the chat card may be exposed to malicious content, such as phishing links or misleading information, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The library does not implement any sanitization or encoding of text fields.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and output encoding are missing. The library should sanitize user-provided text inputs to prevent injection attacks. Specifically, it should HTML encode text content before rendering it into JSON payloads, to neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags or JavaScript code.
- Preconditions:
  1. An application using the `python-card-framework` library accepts user-provided text input.
  2. This input is directly used to populate the `text` field of a `TextParagraph` widget.
  3. The application sends a Google Chat message containing a card with this widget to users.
- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py`
  2. Class `TextParagraph` is defined as a dataclass.
  3. The `text` field is defined as `text: str = standard_field()`.
  4. The `standard_field()` function, defined in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py`, simply creates a dataclass field without any sanitization logic.
  5. The `Renderable` class in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py` and its `render()` method convert the dataclass object into a dictionary, which is then serialized to JSON by `dataclasses-json`.
  6. No sanitization is performed on the `text` field before it is included in the JSON payload.
  7. Visualization:
     ```
     User Input --> Application --> TextParagraph.text (Unsanitized) --> Renderable.render() --> JSON Payload (Vulnerable) --> Google Chat Card --> User View (Vulnerability Triggered)
     ```
- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a Python application that uses the `python-card-framework`.
  2. In this application, create a `TextParagraph` widget.
  3. Populate the `text` field of the `TextParagraph` widget with the following malicious payload: `<a href="https://attacker.com/phishing">Click here to claim your prize!</a>`.
  4. Construct a `Card` and `Message` object, including the `TextParagraph` widget.
  5. Render the `Message` object to get the JSON payload.
  6. Send this JSON payload as a message to a Google Chat space (using a Chat bot or API).
  7. Observe the rendered card in Google Chat.
  8. Verify that the text "Click here to claim your prize!" is rendered as a clickable link to `https://attacker.com/phishing`, demonstrating successful HTML injection.

- Vulnerability Name: Text Injection in DecoratedText Widget
- Description:
  1. An attacker provides malicious text input to an application that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
  2. The application incorporates this unsanitized input into the `top_label`, `text`, or `bottom_label` fields of a `DecoratedText` widget.
  3. The application then uses the `python-card-framework` to render a Google Chat card containing this `DecoratedText` widget.
  4. When a user views the card in Google Chat, the malicious content from these text fields is rendered without sanitization, potentially leading to phishing or other harmful actions.
- Impact: Users viewing the chat card may be exposed to malicious content, such as phishing links or misleading information, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.

     User Input --> Application --> DecoratedText.(top_label/text/bottom_label) (Unsanitized) --> Renderable.render() --> JSON Payload (Vulnerable) --> Google Chat Card --> User View (Vulnerability Triggered)
     ```
- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a Python application that uses the `python-card-framework`.
  2. In this application, create a `DecoratedText` widget.
  3. Populate the `text` field of the `DecoratedText` widget with the following malicious payload: `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`.
  4. Construct a `Card` and `Message` object, including the `DecoratedText` widget.
  5. Render the `Message` object to get the JSON payload.
  6. Send this JSON payload as a message to a Google Chat space.
  7. Observe the rendered card in Google Chat.
  8. Verify that the JavaScript code is executed (e.g., an alert box appears), demonstrating successful JavaScript injection.

- Vulnerability Name: Text Injection in Message Class Text Fields
- Description:
  1. An attacker provides malicious text input to an application that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
  2. The application incorporates this unsanitized input into the `text`, `fallback_text`, or `argument_text` fields of a `Message` object.
  3. The application then uses the `python-card-framework` to render a Google Chat message containing these text fields.
  4. When a user views the chat message, the malicious content from these text fields is rendered without sanitization, potentially leading to phishing or other harmful actions.
- Impact: Users viewing the chat message may be exposed to malicious content directly within the message text, fallback text, or argument text, such as phishing links or misleading information, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.
