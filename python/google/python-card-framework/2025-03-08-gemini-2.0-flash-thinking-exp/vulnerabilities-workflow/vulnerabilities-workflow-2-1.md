- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Card Content

- Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious string containing JavaScript code, for example: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
  - Step 2: A developer using the `python-card-framework` library incorporates user-provided input into a card widget's text field, such as `TextParagraph.text`, without sanitizing or encoding the input.
  - Step 3: The developer uses the library's functions to render the card object into a JSON payload.
  - Step 4: The JSON payload, now containing the malicious script, is sent to the Google Chat API and displayed in a Google Chat client.
  - Step 5: When the Google Chat client renders the card, the injected JavaScript code executes within the user's chat application, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information, or deface the chat interface.

- Impact:
  - Successful XSS attacks can lead to various malicious activities:
    - Account Takeover: Stealing user's session cookies or credentials.
    - Data Theft: Accessing private chat messages or other sensitive information visible in the chat application.
    - Phishing: Displaying fake login prompts or misleading information to trick users into revealing credentials.
    - Defacement: Altering the appearance of chat cards to spread misinformation or cause disruption.
    - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The provided code does not include any explicit input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms to prevent XSS. The library focuses on simplifying JSON creation, not on security.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: The library should provide or recommend input sanitization functions to escape or remove HTML and JavaScript from user-provided text before it's incorporated into card content.
  - Output Encoding: The library should automatically encode text fields when rendering JSON to ensure that any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript is treated as plain text, preventing execution in the chat client.  Specifically, HTML entity encoding for characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` should be applied.
  - Documentation: The library's documentation should explicitly warn developers about the risk of XSS vulnerabilities if user input is not properly handled and should provide guidance on how to sanitize input when using this library.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer must use the `python-card-framework` library to create Google Chat cards.
  - The developer must incorporate user-provided input into text fields of card widgets (e.g., `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, `CardHeader`, `Chip`, `Image`, `GridItem`).
  - The developer must fail to sanitize or encode this user-provided input before using the library to render the card to JSON.
  - The generated JSON payload must be sent to the Google Chat API and rendered in a Google Chat client.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The library utilizes Python dataclasses and the `dataclasses-json` library to serialize Python objects into JSON.
  - Classes like `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, `CardHeader`, `Chip`, `Image`, and `GridItem` (and many others in `/code/card_framework/v2/widgets/` and `/code/card_framework/v2/`) define text fields (e.g., `text: str`, `title: str`, `label: str`, `alt_text: str`).
  - The `Renderable` class and its `render()` method (in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py`) are responsible for converting these dataclass objects into dictionaries, which are then serialized to JSON by `dataclasses-json`.
  - The `standard_field` function in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py` defines how fields are processed, but it does not include any sanitization or encoding logic. It primarily handles letter casing and exclusion of empty values.
  - **Code Walkthrough Example (`TextParagraph`):**
    ```python
    # File: /code/card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py
    import dataclasses
    import dataclasses_json
    from card_framework import standard_field
    from typing import Optional
    from ..widget import Widget

    @dataclasses_json.dataclass_json
    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class TextParagraph(Widget):
      text: str = standard_field()
      max_lines: Optional[int] = standard_field()
    ```
    - The `TextParagraph` class defines a `text` field of type `str`.
    - When a `TextParagraph` object is created with user-provided text and rendered using `render()`, the `text` attribute is directly converted to a JSON string value without any modification.
    - If the user-provided text contains malicious JavaScript, it will be included verbatim in the JSON payload.

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Create a Python script that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
  - Step 2: In the script, construct a `Card` object and add a `Section` and a `TextParagraph` widget.
  - Step 3: Set the `text` attribute of the `TextParagraph` widget to a malicious XSS payload: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");</script>`.
    ```python
    from card_framework.v2 import Card, CardHeader, Message, Section
    from card_framework.v2.widgets import TextParagraph

    malicious_script = "<script>alert(\"XSS Vulnerability Test\");</script>"
    text_widget = TextParagraph(text=malicious_script)
    section = Section(widgets=[text_widget])
    card = Card(sections=[section])
    message = Message(cards=[card])
    json_payload = message.render()
    print(json_payload)
    ```
  - Step 4: Run the script.
  - Step 5: Observe the output JSON payload. It will contain the malicious script directly within the `text` field:
    ```json
    {'cards': [{'card': {'sections': [{'widgets': [{'text_paragraph': {'text': '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");</script>'}}]}]}}]}
    ```
  - Step 6:  While we cannot directly execute this in a real Google Chat client in this test case, the generated JSON payload demonstrates that the malicious script is passed through without sanitization and would be executed if rendered by a chat application.  A real-world test would involve sending this JSON to a Google Chat webhook and observing the XSS in the chat client. For the purpose of this analysis, the JSON output itself serves as proof of the vulnerability because it clearly includes the un-sanitized JavaScript.
