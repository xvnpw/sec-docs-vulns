- Vulnerability Name: JSON Injection in Text Fields
- Description:
    1. An attacker provides malicious input to an application that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
    2. This malicious input is intended to be displayed as text within a Google Chat card or dialog.
    3. The application uses the `python-card-framework` library to create card objects, embedding the unsanitized malicious input into text fields of widgets, card headers, or sections.
    4. The library renders these objects into JSON format without sanitizing the text fields.
    5. The application sends this JSON payload to the Google Chat API.
    6. Google Chat renders the card, executing any injected malicious JSON code within the context of the chat application, potentially leading to unintended actions or information disclosure.
- Impact:
    - By injecting malicious JSON structures into text fields, an attacker could potentially manipulate the structure of the Google Chat card or dialog in unintended ways.
    - This could lead to:
        - **Information Disclosure:** Exfiltrating sensitive data displayed in the chat by altering the card structure to send data to external services.
        - **Unintended Actions:** Triggering unintended actions within the chat application by manipulating button actions or other interactive elements through injected JSON.
        - **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) like behavior within Chat:** While not traditional XSS in a web browser, malicious JSON could be crafted to alter the chat UI or behavior in ways not intended by the application developer.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The library itself does not implement any input sanitization or output encoding for text fields. It focuses solely on generating JSON from Python objects.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The library should include or recommend input sanitization functions to escape or encode user-provided text before embedding it into the JSON payload. This could involve escaping special characters in JSON strings to prevent them from being interpreted as JSON control characters or structures.
    - **Documentation on Secure Usage:** The library documentation should explicitly warn developers about the risks of JSON injection and mandate input sanitization for all user-provided text inputs used within the card framework.
- Preconditions:
    1. An application uses the `python-card-framework` library to generate Google Chat cards or dialogs.
    2. This application incorporates user-provided input into the text fields of these cards or dialogs.
    3. The application does not sanitize or encode user inputs before using the `python-card-framework` library.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`card_framework/__init__.py` and `card_framework/v2/__init__.py`**: These files define the core structure and export all components of the library. They do not contain any sanitization logic.
    2. **`card_framework/v2/widgets` and `card_framework/v2`**: Examining files like `card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py`, `card_framework/v2/widgets/decorated_text.py`, `card_framework/v2/card_header.py`, and others, we see that text fields (e.g., `text` in `TextParagraph`, `title` in `CardHeader`) are directly taken as input and serialized into JSON using `dataclasses_json`.
    3. **`Renderable.render()` method in `card_framework/__init__.py`**: This method is responsible for converting the Python objects into JSON. It uses `self.to_dict()` which, in turn, relies on `dataclasses_json` to perform the serialization. `dataclasses_json` by default does not perform any sanitization or encoding of string values beyond basic JSON string formatting.
    4. **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input --> Application Code --> python-card-framework Object Creation -->
    Renderable.render() --> to_dict() (dataclasses_json) --> JSON Payload --> Google Chat API
                                        ^ No Sanitization Here
    ```

    In the code, there are numerous dataclasses that represent card components. For example, `TextParagraph` widget:

    ```python
    # File: /code/card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py
    @dataclasses_json.dataclass_json
    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class TextParagraph(Widget):
        """TextParagraph
        ...
        """
        text: str = standard_field() # User input can be assigned here
        max_lines: Optional[int] = standard_field()
    ```

    When `TextParagraph` object is created with user-provided text and then `render()` method is called, the `text` field will be directly included in the JSON output without any sanitization.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a simple Python application that uses the `python-card-framework` library to send a message to Google Chat. This application should take user input and display it in a `TextParagraph` widget within a card.
    2. **Malicious Input:** As an attacker, provide the following malicious input string:
       ```json
       "}], \"header\": {\"title\": \"Malicious Title\", \"subtitle\": \"Malicious Subtitle\"}, \"sections\": [{\"widgets\": [{\"textParagraph\": {\"text\": \"Malicious Text\"} } ] } ] }, \"cardId\": \"maliciousCard\" } }"
       ```
       This input is designed to close the current JSON structure and inject a new, malicious card structure.
    3. **Application Processing:** The application should take this input and use it as the `text` for a `TextParagraph` widget. It then constructs a `Card` and `Message` object using the library and calls `message.render()` to generate the JSON payload.
    4. **Send to Google Chat:** The application sends the rendered JSON payload to the Google Chat API.
    5. **Verification:** Observe the rendered card in Google Chat. If the vulnerability is present, you should see a card with "Malicious Title", "Malicious Subtitle", and "Malicious Text" instead of the intended card. This indicates that the injected JSON has been successfully interpreted by Google Chat, overriding the intended card structure.

    **Python Test Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

    ```python
    from card_framework.v2 import Card, CardHeader, Message, Section
    from card_framework.v2.widgets import TextParagraph

    def send_chat_message(user_input):
        text_paragraph = TextParagraph(text=user_input) # Vulnerable point - unsanitized input
        section = Section(widgets=[text_paragraph])
        card = Card(sections=[section])
        message = Message(cards=[card])
        json_payload = message.render()
        print(json_payload) # Output the JSON payload to inspect it
        # In a real test, you would send this payload to the Chat API
        # and observe the rendered card in Google Chat.

    malicious_input = '"}], "header": {"title": "Malicious Title", "subtitle": "Malicious Subtitle"}, "sections": [{"widgets": [{"textParagraph": {"text": "Malicious Text"} } ] } ] }, "cardId": "maliciousCard" } }'
    send_chat_message(malicious_input)
    ```

This vulnerability allows for potential manipulation of the card structure by injecting JSON code through text fields because the library does not sanitize user inputs before rendering them into JSON. Developers using this library must be aware of this and implement their own sanitization to prevent JSON injection attacks.
