### Unsanitized Input in Text Fields in Card Widgets Leading to Cross-Site Scripting and Content Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsanitized Input in Text Fields in Card Widgets Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Content Injection

- **Description:**
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious string containing JavaScript code (for XSS), HTML, or Markdown formatting (for Content Injection), or malicious links (for Phishing). Examples include: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`, `<a href='https://evil.com'>Click here</a>`, or `[Click for free prizes!](javascript:alert('Markdown Content Injection!'))`.
  - Step 2: A developer using the `python-card-framework` library incorporates user-provided input into text fields of various card widgets such as `TextParagraph.text`, `DecoratedText` (`top_label`, `text`, `bottom_label`), `CardHeader.title`, `Chip.text`, `Image.alt_text`, `GridItem.text`, and `Message` class text fields like `text`, `fallback_text`, or `argument_text`. This is done without sanitizing or encoding the input to neutralize potentially harmful content.
  - Step 3: The developer uses the library's functions, specifically the `render()` method of `Card` or `Message` objects, to render these card objects into a JSON payload.
  - Step 4: The JSON payload, now containing the malicious script, HTML, Markdown, or links, is sent to the Google Chat API and displayed in a Google Chat client.
  - Step 5: When the Google Chat client renders the card or message, the injected malicious content is processed. If the client is vulnerable, JavaScript code will execute (XSS), HTML or Markdown formatting will be rendered (Content Injection), or malicious links will be displayed (Phishing). This can allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information, deface the chat interface, mislead users, or redirect them to malicious websites.

- **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation of unsanitized input can lead to various malicious activities:
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
      - Account Takeover: Stealing user's session cookies or credentials.
      - Data Theft: Accessing private chat messages or other sensitive information visible in the chat application.
      - Phishing: Displaying fake login prompts or misleading information to trick users into revealing credentials.
      - Defacement: Altering the appearance of chat cards to spread misinformation or cause disruption.
      - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Content Injection:**
      - Misleading users with fake information or manipulated content.
      - Phishing attacks by injecting malicious links that appear legitimate.
      - Defacement of chat cards and messages.
      - Potential client-side script injection if the client application uses a web-based rendering engine and doesn't properly sanitize HTML.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The `python-card-framework` library, as currently implemented, does not include any input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms to prevent XSS or content injection. The `standard_field` function and the rendering process focus on JSON serialization without considering security aspects like input validation or output encoding.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Sanitization:** The library should provide or recommend input sanitization functions. For text fields intended to display user-provided content, the library should automatically sanitize or offer options for developers to sanitize input to escape or remove HTML, JavaScript, and other potentially malicious formatting codes before it's incorporated into card content.
  - **Output Encoding:** The library should automatically encode text fields when rendering JSON to ensure that any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript is treated as plain text, preventing execution in the chat client. Specifically, HTML entity encoding for characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` should be applied. For Markdown support, a Markdown sanitization library should be used to parse and sanitize user input before rendering.
  - **Developer Guidance:** The library's documentation must explicitly warn developers about the risk of XSS and content injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly handled. It should provide clear guidance and best practices on how to sanitize input when using this library, emphasizing the importance of encoding user-provided text before using it in widget text fields and message text fields.

- **Preconditions:**
  - A developer must use the `python-card-framework` library to create Google Chat cards and messages.
  - The developer must incorporate user-provided input into text fields of card widgets (e.g., `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, `CardHeader`, `Chip`, `Image`, `GridItem`) or message text fields (`text`, `fallback_text`, `argument_text`).
  - The developer must fail to sanitize or encode this user-provided input before using the library to render the card or message to JSON.
  - The generated JSON payload must be sent to the Google Chat API and rendered in a Google Chat client.
  - The Google Chat client must be susceptible to rendering or executing injected content (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, Markdown).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The library utilizes Python dataclasses and the `dataclasses-json` library to serialize Python objects into JSON.
  - Classes like `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, `CardHeader`, `Chip`, `Image`, `GridItem`, and `Message` (in `/code/card_framework/v2/widgets/`, `/code/card_framework/v2/`, and `/code/card_framework/v2/message.py`) define text fields (e.g., `text: str`, `title: str`, `label: str`, `alt_text: str`, `text`, `fallback_text`, `argument_text`). These fields are typically defined using `standard_field()`.
  - The `standard_field` function in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py` is a wrapper around `dataclasses.field` and `dataclasses_json.config`, primarily handling letter casing and exclusion of empty values for JSON serialization. It does **not** include any sanitization or encoding logic.
  - The `Renderable` class and its `render()` method (in `/code/card_framework/__init__.py`) are responsible for converting these dataclass objects into dictionaries using `to_dict()` method provided by `dataclasses-json`, which are then serialized to JSON. This process directly converts the string values of text fields into JSON string values without any modification or sanitization.

  - **Code Walkthrough Example (`TextParagraph`):**
    ```python
    # File: /code/card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py
    import dataclasses
    import dataclasses_json
    from card_framework import standard_field
    from typing import Optional
    from ..widget import Widget

    @dataclasses_json.dataclass_json
    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class TextParagraph(Widget):
      text: str = standard_field() # User input assigned here, no sanitization
      max_lines: Optional[int] = standard_field()
    ```
    - The `TextParagraph` class defines a `text` field of type `str`, assigned using `standard_field()`.
    - When a `TextParagraph` object is created with user-provided text and rendered using `render()`, the `text` attribute is directly converted to a JSON string value without any sanitization or encoding.
    - If the user-provided text contains malicious JavaScript, HTML, or Markdown, it will be included verbatim in the JSON payload.

  - **Data Flow Visualization:**

    ```
    [User Input (Unsanitized String)] --> Widget/Message Text Attribute --> standard_field() --> dataclasses_json.to_dict() --> Rendered JSON Payload --> Google Chat API --> Google Chat Client (XSS/Content Injection if Client is Vulnerable)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
  - Step 1: Create a Python script that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
  - Step 2: In the script, construct a `Card` object and add a `Section` and a `TextParagraph` widget (or `DecoratedText` or set `Message.text`).
  - Step 3: Set the `text` attribute of the chosen widget (or `Message.text`) to a malicious payload. Examples:
    - XSS Payload: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");</script>`
    - HTML Injection Payload: `<a href="https://attacker.com/phishing">Click here to claim your prize!</a>`
    - Markdown Injection Payload: `[Click for free prizes!](javascript:alert('Markdown Content Injection!'))`
  - Step 4: Render the `Message` object to obtain the JSON payload using `message.render()`.
  - Step 5: Inspect the output JSON payload. It will contain the malicious script, HTML, or Markdown directly within the text field without any sanitization or encoding.
    ```python
    from card_framework.v2 import Card, CardHeader, Message, Section
    from card_framework.v2.widgets import TextParagraph

    malicious_script = "<script>alert(\"XSS Vulnerability Test\");</script>"
    text_widget = TextParagraph(text=malicious_script)
    section = Section(widgets=[text_widget])
    card = Card(sections=[section])
    message = Message(cards=[card])
    json_payload = message.render()
    print(json_payload)
    ```
  - Step 6:  While the JSON output confirms the vulnerability, to fully validate in a real-world scenario:
    - Send this generated JSON payload to a Google Chat webhook or through a Google Chat bot.
    - Observe the rendered card or message in a Google Chat client.
    - Verify that the injected JavaScript code executes (e.g., an alert box appears), the HTML link is rendered as clickable and functional, or the Markdown link behaves as intended.
    - For the purpose of analysis, the JSON output itself serves as strong evidence of the vulnerability because it clearly includes the un-sanitized malicious content, demonstrating the library's failure to mitigate injection risks.

### JSON Injection in Text Fields

- **Vulnerability Name:** JSON Injection in Text Fields

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker provides malicious input specifically crafted as a JSON structure to an application that uses the `python-card-framework` library.
    2. This malicious input is intended to be displayed as text within a Google Chat card or dialog, aiming to manipulate the JSON structure of the card itself.
    3. The application, without sanitizing, uses the `python-card-framework` library to create card objects, embedding this malicious JSON input into text fields of widgets, card headers, or sections (e.g., `TextParagraph.text`).
    4. The library renders these objects into JSON format. Critically, because the input is not sanitized, the injected JSON code is treated as part of the JSON structure itself, not merely as text content.
    5. The application sends this JSON payload to the Google Chat API.
    6. Google Chat receives and renders the card. Due to the injected JSON, the intended card structure can be altered, potentially leading to unintended actions or information disclosure within the chat application.

- **Impact:**
    - By injecting malicious JSON structures into text fields, an attacker can manipulate the intended structure of the Google Chat card or dialog. This can result in:
        - **Information Disclosure:** Altering the card structure to exfiltrate sensitive data displayed in the chat by, for example, modifying actions to send data to external services controlled by the attacker.
        - **Unintended Actions:** Triggering unintended actions within the chat application by manipulating button actions, form inputs, or other interactive elements through injected JSON, potentially leading to unauthorized operations.
        - **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) like behavior within Chat:** While not traditional XSS in a web browser context, malicious JSON can be designed to alter the chat UI or application behavior in ways not anticipated or intended by the application developer, effectively creating a form of client-side manipulation within the chat environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `python-card-framework` library does not implement any input sanitization or output encoding for text fields that would prevent JSON injection. It purely focuses on converting Python objects to JSON, assuming the input data is safe.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** The library should include or strongly recommend input sanitization functions to escape or encode user-provided text before embedding it into the JSON payload. This should specifically address characters that have special meaning in JSON strings (like `}`, `{`, `:`, `,`, `"`), ensuring they are treated as literal text and not as structural JSON elements.  A robust approach would involve JSON-encoding user-provided strings before embedding them into the larger JSON structure.
    - **Documentation on Secure Usage:** The library documentation must explicitly warn developers about the serious risks of JSON injection. It should mandate input sanitization for all user-provided text inputs that are used within the card framework, providing clear examples and best practices for how to properly sanitize and encode these inputs to prevent injection attacks.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. An application uses the `python-card-framework` library to generate Google Chat cards or dialogs.
    2. The application incorporates user-provided input into the text fields of these cards or dialogs (e.g., in `TextParagraph`, `DecoratedText`, etc.).
    3. The application fails to sanitize or properly encode user inputs, specifically against JSON injection attacks, before using the `python-card-framework` library.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The core of the issue lies in the library's design which directly serializes text fields into JSON without any form of sanitization.
    - Examining files like `card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py`, `card_framework/v2/widgets/decorated_text.py`, and `card_framework/v2/card_header.py`, we observe that text fields (e.g., `text` in `TextParagraph`, `title` in `CardHeader`) are taken as input and directly serialized into JSON using `dataclasses_json` via the `Renderable.render()` method and `to_dict()` conversion.
    - The `standard_field()` function in `card_framework/__init__.py` only configures JSON serialization aspects like letter casing and exclusion of empty values, and does not include any sanitization or encoding logic.
    - The `dataclasses_json` library, used for serialization, by default does not perform any sanitization or encoding of string values beyond basic JSON string formatting, which is insufficient to prevent JSON injection.

    - **Code Snippet Example (`TextParagraph` Widget):**

    ```python
    # File: /code/card_framework/v2/widgets/text_paragraph.py
    @dataclasses_json.dataclass_json
    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class TextParagraph(Widget):
        text: str = standard_field() # User input directly assigned, vulnerable to injection
        max_lines: Optional[int] = standard_field()
    ```
    - When a `TextParagraph` object is created with malicious JSON input in the `text` field, and the `render()` method is called, this malicious JSON is passed through directly into the final JSON payload without any modification or escaping.

    - **Data Flow Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Malicious JSON String) --> Application Code --> python-card-framework Object Creation --> Renderable.render() --> to_dict() (dataclasses_json) --> JSON Payload (Vulnerable to JSON Injection) --> Google Chat API
                                                                        ^ No JSON Sanitization/Encoding
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a Python application that uses the `python-card-framework` library to send a message to Google Chat. This application should take user input and display it in a `TextParagraph` widget within a card.
    2. **Malicious Input:** As an attacker, provide a malicious JSON input string designed to inject a new card structure. For example:
       ```json
       "}], \"header\": {\"title\": \"Malicious Title\", \"subtitle\": \"Malicious Subtitle\"}, \"sections\": [{\"widgets\": [{\"textParagraph\": {\"text\": \"Malicious Text\"} } ] } ] }, \"cardId\": \"maliciousCard\" } }"
       ```
       This input string is crafted to close the intended JSON structure and then inject a completely new, attacker-controlled card structure with a malicious title, subtitle, and text content.
    3. **Application Processing:** The application should take this malicious input and use it directly as the `text` for a `TextParagraph` widget, without any sanitization. It then constructs a `Card` and `Message` object and renders the message to JSON using `message.render()`.
    4. **Send to Google Chat:** The application sends the generated JSON payload to the Google Chat API.
    5. **Verification:** Observe the rendered card in Google Chat. If the JSON injection is successful, you will see a card rendered with the "Malicious Title", "Malicious Subtitle", and "Malicious Text" defined in the injected JSON, instead of the card the developer originally intended to send. This confirms that the injected JSON was interpreted by Google Chat, effectively manipulating the card structure.

    - **Conceptual Python Test Code Snippet:**

    ```python
    from card_framework.v2 import Card, CardHeader, Message, Section
    from card_framework.v2.widgets import TextParagraph

    def send_chat_message(user_input):
        text_paragraph = TextParagraph(text=user_input) # Vulnerable point: unsanitized input
        section = Section(widgets=[text_paragraph])
        card = Card(sections=[section])
        message = Message(cards=[card])
        json_payload = message.render()
        print(json_payload) # Inspect the JSON payload
        # In a real test, send this payload to Google Chat API and observe rendering.

    malicious_input = '"}], "header": {"title": "Malicious Title", "subtitle": "Malicious Subtitle"}, "sections": [{"widgets": [{"textParagraph": {"text": "Malicious Text"} } ] } ] }, "cardId": "maliciousCard" } }'
    send_chat_message(malicious_input)
    ```
    By running this test and observing the rendered card in Google Chat, you can verify whether the JSON injection vulnerability is exploitable. If the rendered card reflects the malicious content instead of the expected content, it confirms the vulnerability.
