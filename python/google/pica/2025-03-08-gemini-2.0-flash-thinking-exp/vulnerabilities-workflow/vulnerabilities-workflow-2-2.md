Based on provided vulnerability list and instructions, let's evaluate each vulnerability:

**Vulnerability: Insufficient MAC Address Validation in HTTP API**

* **Include only valid vulnerabilities that are part of attack vector:** Yes, this is a valid vulnerability related to input validation, and exploiting HTTP API is a described attack vector.
* **Exclude vulnerabilities that:
    - are only missing documentation to mitigate.** - No, this is about missing input validation logic.
    - **are deny of service vulnerabilities.** - No, while possible, the impact is broader than just DoS, including unpredictable behavior.
    - **are not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world.** - No, HTTP API vulnerabilities are very realistic to exploit.
    - **are not completely described, e.g. missing source code analysis or security test case.** - No, the description is detailed and includes source code analysis (within limitations of provided code) and security test case.
    - **are only theoretical, e.g. missing evidence of exploit in source code analysis.** - No, it is based on a plausible assumption of missing validation and provides a test case to verify.
    - **are not high or critical severity.** - Yes, this vulnerability is ranked as **Medium**.

According to the instruction "Exclude vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity", this vulnerability should be excluded because its rank is Medium.

Since this is the only vulnerability provided and it is excluded based on severity, the final list of vulnerabilities will be empty.
