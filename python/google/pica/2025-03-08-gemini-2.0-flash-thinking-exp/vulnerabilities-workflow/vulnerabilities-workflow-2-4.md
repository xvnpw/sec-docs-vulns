### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenAPI Documentation

* Description:
    1. An attacker modifies the `openapi.yaml` file.
    2. The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the description field of an OpenAPI schema or path. For example, they could add `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` to the description of the `/get-state` endpoint.
    3. The Pica application reads and renders the OpenAPI documentation, likely including these descriptions, in the web GUI at `/openapi` endpoint.
    4. A user accesses the `/openapi` documentation page in their web browser.
    5. Because the descriptions from `openapi.yaml` are rendered without proper sanitization or output encoding, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the description is executed in the user's browser.

* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they access the Pica web GUI. This can lead to:
    - Account hijacking: Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information to impersonate the user.
    - Data theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data accessible to the web application.
    - Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page seen by the user.
    - Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Execution of arbitrary actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user within the Pica application.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the provided files, there is no evidence of input sanitization or output encoding being implemented for the OpenAPI documentation descriptions in the web GUI. Source code analysis of the HTTP server (`/code/src/bin/http-server/main.rs`) would be required to confirm this.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The application should sanitize the descriptions read from `openapi.yaml` to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code before rendering them in the web GUI.
    - Output encoding: When rendering the descriptions in HTML, the application should use proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to ensure that any HTML characters in the descriptions are treated as text and not interpreted as HTML tags or JavaScript code.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the `openapi.yaml` file. In a real-world scenario, this might be possible if the attacker has access to the source code repository, can perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack if the file is fetched remotely without TLS and integrity checks, or if the application reads the `openapi.yaml` from a user-controlled location. For testing purposes, we assume the attacker can modify a local copy of `openapi.yaml`.
    - The Pica web server must be running and serving the OpenAPI documentation at `/openapi`.
    - A user must access the `/openapi` documentation page in their web browser.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code for `/code/src/bin/http-server/main.rs` is not provided, so a full source code analysis cannot be performed.
    - Based on the project description and the presence of `openapi.yaml`, it's assumed that the Pica web GUI dynamically generates the OpenAPI documentation page by reading and rendering the content of `openapi.yaml`.
    - If the Rust code that handles rendering the OpenAPI documentation in the web GUI does not implement proper sanitization or output encoding of the description fields from `openapi.yaml`, then the XSS vulnerability is present.
    - Further investigation of the Rust code is needed to pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability and confirm the absence of mitigations.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Clone the Pica repository if not already done: `git clone https://github.com/google/pica.git`
        - Navigate to the `pica/code` directory: `cd pica/code`
        - Start the Pica server by running: `cargo run` (or `cargo run --features web` or `cargo run --bin pica-http` if needed based on build configuration). Note the address and port the web server starts on (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:3000`).

    2. **Modify `openapi.yaml`:**
        - Open the `/code/static/openapi.yaml` file in a text editor.
        - Locate the description field for any schema or path. For example, find the description for the `/get-state` path under `paths:`.
        - Inject a malicious JavaScript payload into this description. Replace the existing description with the following:
          ```yaml
          description: <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in Pica OpenAPI Documentation!")</script> This is a vulnerable description.
          ```
        - Save the modified `openapi.yaml` file.

    3. **Access OpenAPI Documentation:**
        - Open a web browser and navigate to the OpenAPI documentation URL of your Pica instance (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:3000/openapi`).

    4. **Verify XSS Execution:**
        - Check if an alert box pops up in your browser with the message "XSS Vulnerability in Pica OpenAPI Documentation!".
        - If the alert box appears, it confirms that the JavaScript code injected into the `openapi.yaml` description was executed, demonstrating the Reflected XSS vulnerability.
        - Inspect the HTML source of the `/openapi` page to confirm that the `<script>` tag from `openapi.yaml` is present in the rendered HTML without proper encoding.
