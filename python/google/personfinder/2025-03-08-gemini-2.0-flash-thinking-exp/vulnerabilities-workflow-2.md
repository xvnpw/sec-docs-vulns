## Combined Vulnerability List

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Person Finder Application

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload, which could be JavaScript code intended for XSS. This payload can be injected through different vectors:
        - **Stored XSS via Person Entry Fields**: An attacker inputs the malicious payload into a Person entry field, such as "given_name", "family_name", or "full_name" during person creation or modification.
        - **Reflected XSS via Malicious URLs**: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload in a user-submitted data field (e.g., `query_name` in search, or fields like `full_name`, `description`, `location` if reflected in person profiles).
    2. In the case of stored XSS, when a user views the Person entry, either through a direct link or search results, the application renders the Person entry. For reflected XSS, a user is enticed to click on the malicious URL.
    3. The application renders the Person entry or search results, including the attacker's malicious payload, within a Django template. In the case of reflected XSS, the payload from the URL is reflected back to the user.
    4. If the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before rendering them in the template, the malicious JavaScript payload will be executed in the user's browser.
    5. The attacker can then potentially steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the application.

- Impact:
    - High: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
        - **Account Takeover**: Stealing session cookies or user credentials, leading to account compromise.
        - **Data Manipulation**: Modifying content displayed to other users, potentially defacing the website or displaying misleading information.
        - **Malicious Redirection**: Redirecting users to malicious websites, potentially leading to further exploitation or phishing attacks.
        - **Session Hijacking**: Gaining control over the user's session.
        - **Cookie Theft**: Stealing sensitive information stored in cookies.
        - **Defacement of the Web Application**: Altering the visual appearance of the website to mislead or harm users.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Dynamic resources are not directly accessible via HTTP for security reasons, as stated in `/code/app/resources/README.md`.
    - Django templates are used for dynamic content, which provides automatic escaping of HTML by default. However, the effectiveness of default auto-escaping in all contexts where user-supplied data is rendered needs to be verified.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit Output Sanitization**: Verify and enforce explicit output sanitization of all user-supplied data within Django templates, especially for fields rendered directly without explicit escaping filters.
    - **Security Review of Django Templates**: Conduct a thorough security review of all Django templates to ensure that every instance of user-supplied data is properly escaped using context-aware escaping mechanisms.
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input sanitization for user-submitted data at the server-side to remove or encode potentially malicious HTML, JavaScript, or other active content before storing it in the database.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: While CSP might be mentioned in `/code/app/settings.py`, ensure it is effectively configured and enforced to mitigate XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. Review CSP configuration to ensure it is not bypassed by user-supplied content.

- Preconditions:
    - A publicly accessible instance of the Person Finder application must be running.
    - For stored XSS, an attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Person entry. This could be through the application's UI or API.
    - For reflected XSS, users must interact with attacker-crafted URLs, typically by clicking on them.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `app/resources/README.md`: Indicates Django templates are used, suggesting auto-escaping. However, this needs verification in practice.
    2. `app/wsgi.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/app.yaml`: Confirm Django application setup and routing for relevant paths.
    3. **Django Templates Analysis (Requires further investigation of `app/resources/templates/` or similar)**:
        - Identify Django templates responsible for rendering Person entries and search results.
        - Examine how user-supplied data (e.g., person names, descriptions, search queries) is rendered in these templates.
        - Verify if Django's auto-escaping is consistently applied and if there are cases where it might be bypassed (e.g., using `|safe` filter incorrectly or rendering data outside of Django's template engine).
        - Look for template code like `{{ person.full_name }}` or `{{ search_query }}` without explicit escaping filters like `|escape`. Such instances are potential XSS vulnerabilities if `person.full_name` or `search_query` originates from user input.
    4. **Python Handlers Analysis (Requires further investigation of handlers in `app/` directory)**:
        - Examine Python code that fetches and prepares data for rendering in Django templates.
        - Check if any manual string manipulation or concatenation is performed on user-supplied data before passing it to templates, which could bypass auto-escaping.

- Security Test Case:
    **Test Case 1: Stored XSS in Person Entry Fields**
    1. Access the Person Finder application in a web browser.
    2. Navigate to the "create person" page (or similar page for adding a person).
    3. In the "Given name" field, enter the XSS payload: `<script>alert("Stored XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
    4. Fill in other required fields for Person entry creation.
    5. Submit the Person entry.
    6. After successful creation, navigate to the "view person" page for the newly created entry (e.g., by searching for the person's name).
    7. Observe if an alert box with "Stored XSS Vulnerability" is displayed when viewing the Person entry. If yes, stored XSS is present.
    8. Examine the HTML source of the person profile page to confirm the payload is present and not properly encoded.

    **Test Case 2: Reflected XSS in Search Results**
    1. Access the Person Finder application's home page.
    2. Use the search functionality.
    3. Craft a malicious search query URL by injecting the XSS payload into the search query parameter: `https://example.org/personfinder/haiti/results?query_name=<script>alert("Reflected XSS in Search");</script>&role=seek` (adjust URL path and parameters as needed for the application).
    4. Access the crafted malicious URL in the browser.
    5. Check if an alert box with "Reflected XSS in Search" appears. If yes, reflected XSS is present in search results.
    6. Examine the HTML source of the search results page to confirm the payload is reflected and not properly encoded.

    **Test Case 3: Stored XSS in "Full Name" or other Profile Fields**
    1. Access the Person Finder application's home page.
    2. Navigate to the "Add Person" page.
    3. Fill in required fields.
    4. In the "Full Name" field, enter the XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert("Stored XSS in Full Name")>`.
    5. Submit the form to create the person profile.
    6. Navigate to the "View Person" page for the newly created profile.
    7. Check if an alert box with "Stored XSS in Full Name" appears. If yes, stored XSS is present in the "Full Name" field (or field where injected).
    8. Examine the HTML source of the person profile page to confirm the payload is present and not properly encoded.
