- Vulnerability name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Person Profiles and Search Results

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload in a user-submitted data field (e.g., `full_name`, `description`, `location`).
  2. The attacker entices a user to click on this malicious URL, which could be distributed via email, social media, or other channels.
  3. The user's browser sends a request to the Person Finder application with the malicious payload.
  4. The Person Finder application, without proper sanitization, reflects the malicious payload from the URL back to the user within the HTML content of the person profile or search results page.
  5. The user's browser executes the malicious script, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, user credentials, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

- Impact:
  - Account Takeover: An attacker can steal session cookies or user credentials of other users who view the manipulated person profiles or search results, leading to account compromise.
  - Data Manipulation: An attacker can modify the content of the Person Finder database as viewed by other users, potentially defacing the website or displaying misleading information.
  - Malicious Redirection: An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to further exploitation or phishing attacks.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - Based on the provided files, there is no evidence of implemented mitigations against XSS vulnerabilities in the project. The files are mostly configuration and deployment related, lacking in-depth source code for user input handling and output rendering.

- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: The application is missing proper input sanitization for user-submitted data before rendering it in HTML pages. All user-submitted data displayed in person profiles and search results should be sanitized to remove or encode potentially malicious HTML, JavaScript, or other active content.
  - Output encoding: The application is missing output encoding when rendering user-submitted data in HTML templates. Dynamic content should be encoded using context-aware output encoding (e.g., Django's autoescaping or `django.utils.html.escape`) to prevent the browser from interpreting user-supplied strings as code.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) could mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and execute scripts. While CSP is mentioned in `/code/app/settings.py`, it's unclear if it's effectively configured to mitigate XSS originating from user input.

- Preconditions:
  - A publicly accessible instance of the Person Finder application must be running.
  - Users must interact with attacker-crafted URLs.

- Source code analysis:
  - Based on the provided `PROJECT FILES`, there is no source code available to analyze the data handling and rendering logic directly.
  - Assuming the application uses Django templates and `utils.BaseHandler.render()` as described in `/code/app/resources/README.md`, the vulnerability likely exists in the Django templates where user-submitted data is rendered without proper escaping.
  - For example, if a template renders a field like `{{ person.full_name }}` directly without using Django's `escape` filter or autoescaping, it would be vulnerable to XSS if `person.full_name` contains malicious JavaScript code.
  - To fix this, all dynamic content rendered in Django templates should be properly escaped using `{{ dynamic_content|escape }}` or by ensuring autoescape is enabled and context-aware.

- Security test case:
  1. Access the Person Finder application's home page in a web browser.
  2. Navigate to the "Add Person" page.
  3. Fill in the required fields (e.g., given name, family name, author name).
  4. In the "Full Name" field (or another relevant field like "description" or "last known location"), enter the following XSS payload: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
  5. Submit the form to create the person profile.
  6. After successful creation, navigate to the "View Person" page for the newly created profile.
  7. Check if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears. If the alert box appears, the vulnerability is present.
  8. Alternatively, or additionally, examine the HTML source code of the person profile page in the browser's developer tools. Search for the injected XSS payload. If the payload is present in the HTML source without being properly encoded (e.g., as HTML entities), the vulnerability is confirmed.

  Another test case:
  1. Access the Person Finder application's home page in a web browser.
  2. Use the search functionality to search for a person.
  3. Craft a malicious search query. For example, if the search query is reflected in the search results page, try injecting the XSS payload in the search query parameter in the URL, e.g., `https://example.org/personfinder/haiti/results?query_name=<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>&role=seek`.
  4. Access the crafted malicious URL.
  5. Check if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears. If the alert box appears, the vulnerability is present.
  6. Alternatively, or additionally, examine the HTML source code of the search results page in the browser's developer tools. Search for the injected XSS payload. If the payload is present in the HTML source without being properly encoded, the vulnerability is confirmed.
