- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Person Entry Fields
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload within a Person entry field, such as "given_name" or "family_name". This payload could be JavaScript code intended for XSS.
    2. A user views the Person entry, either through a direct link or search results.
    3. The application renders the Person entry, including the attacker's malicious payload, within a Django template.
    4. If the application fails to properly sanitize the Person entry fields before rendering them in the template, the malicious JavaScript payload will be executed in the user's browser.
    5. The attacker can then potentially steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the application.
- Impact:
    - High: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the web application. Given the sensitive nature of personal data handled by Person Finder, the impact of data breaches and unauthorized actions is significant.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Dynamic resources are not directly accessible via HTTP for security reasons, as stated in `/code/app/resources/README.md`: "Dynamic resources are not directly visible via HTTP for security reason."
    - Django templates are used for dynamic content, which provides automatic escaping of HTML by default.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicit output sanitization of user-supplied data within Django templates needs to be verified and enforced, especially for fields that are rendered directly without explicit escaping filters.
    - Security review of Django templates to ensure all user-supplied data is properly escaped.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Person entry. This could be through the application's UI if user contributions are allowed, or through direct API access if not properly secured.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `app/resources/README.md`: Indicates that dynamic resources are rendered using Django templates. This is good, as Django templates have auto-escaping enabled by default. However, it needs to be verified that auto-escaping is consistently applied and not bypassed in templates that display person entries.
    2. `app/wsgi.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/app.yaml`: These files set up the Django application and routing. `app/app.yaml` defines handlers that use `wsgi.application`, indicating Django is used for those paths. `app/main.py` handles other paths using webapp2, which might have different security considerations, although XSS is more likely in the Django templates according to the initial prompt.
    3. Deeper source code analysis of Python files (like handlers in `app/` directory) and Django templates (`app/resources/templates/` if available, or within `app/resources/` if not separated) is needed to pinpoint the exact locations where user-supplied data is rendered and to check for sanitization. Without specific code handling person entries and rendering templates, further analysis is limited.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Access the Person Finder application in a web browser.
    2. Navigate to the "create person" page.
    3. In the "Given name" field, enter a XSS payload like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    4. Fill in other required fields for Person entry creation (e.g., Family name, Author name, Source date).
    5. Submit the Person entry.
    6. After successful creation, navigate to the "view person" page for the newly created entry. This could be done by searching for the person's name and clicking on the result.
    7. Observe if an alert box with "XSS" is displayed when viewing the Person entry. If the alert box appears, it indicates that the XSS payload was executed, and the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.
