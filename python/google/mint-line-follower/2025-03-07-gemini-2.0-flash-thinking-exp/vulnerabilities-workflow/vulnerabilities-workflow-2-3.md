- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Code Injection

- Description:
  1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the robot's microcontroller, either physically or by social engineering the user.
  2. The attacker replaces the original CircuitPython code files on the `CIRCUITPY` drive with modified, malicious code. This can be done by connecting the robot to a computer via USB and directly modifying the files on the exposed `CIRCUITPY` drive, which behaves like a USB drive.
  3. Alternatively, an attacker could trick a user into downloading and manually copying malicious code files to the `CIRCUITPY` drive.
  4. Upon the next power-up or reset of the microcontroller, the CircuitPython interpreter will execute the attacker's malicious code instead of the intended program.
  5. The malicious code can then control the robot's actuators (servos, LEDs) and sensors in unintended ways, leading to robot malfunction or harmful behavior within its operational environment. For example, the robot could be programmed to move erratically, ignore line following instructions, drive at excessive speed, or even attempt to damage itself or its surroundings.

- Impact:
  - The robot's intended functionality is compromised, leading to unpredictable or erroneous behavior.
  - The robot could cause physical damage to itself, surrounding objects, or people if programmed to behave dangerously (e.g., driving off a table, colliding with objects at high speed).
  - In an educational setting, this could disrupt workshops, damage equipment, or pose safety risks if the robot behaves unexpectedly.
  - The credibility of the educational material and the workshop could be undermined.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The provided code examples and the CircuitPython environment are designed for ease of modification and accessibility in educational settings, explicitly prioritizing open access to the code over security. There are no built-in mechanisms within the project to prevent or detect malicious code injection.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Secure Boot: Implementation of secure boot mechanisms to ensure that only signed and trusted firmware can be executed on the microcontroller. However, this is not a standard feature of CircuitPython or the target hardware (Xiao RP2040) in typical educational use cases.
  - Code Signing: Employing code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of the CircuitPython code before execution. This would involve cryptographic signatures and a mechanism to validate these signatures on the microcontroller, which is not implemented.
  - Write Protection for Original Code: Making the original code or parts of the filesystem read-only to prevent unauthorized modifications. This would require a different approach to how CircuitPython projects are distributed and updated.
  - Sandboxing and Permissions: Implementing a sandboxing environment or a permission system within CircuitPython to limit the capabilities of the executed code, restricting access to sensitive hardware or functionalities. This is a complex mitigation not typically found in lightweight microcontroller environments like CircuitPython.
  - User Awareness and Security Guidelines: Providing clear warnings and guidelines to users about the risks of running untrusted code and the importance of verifying the source of any code loaded onto the robot. This is a documentation-based mitigation, but it is currently missing from the provided materials beyond the general licensing information.

- Preconditions:
  - Physical access to the robot kit by the attacker, or the ability to socially engineer the user into downloading and installing malicious code.
  - The robot must be powered on or reset after the malicious code has been injected for the exploit to take effect.
  - The target system is running CircuitPython and the filesystem is accessible as a USB drive when connected to a computer.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - CircuitPython Execution Model: CircuitPython is designed to execute Python code directly from the filesystem, specifically from the `code.py` file or other `.py` files present on the `CIRCUITPY` drive. There is no compilation or pre-execution verification step that would prevent the execution of modified or malicious code.
  - File System Access: When the Xiao RP2040 microcontroller is connected to a computer in bootloader mode (by holding the "BOOT" button during USB connection or after initial firmware flash), the `CIRCUITPY` drive is exposed as a standard USB mass storage device. This allows for unrestricted read and write access to the files on this drive, including the Python code files.
  - Example Code Examination: The provided example codes, such as `5_line_follower.py` and `7_button.py`, directly control the robot's servos based on sensor readings or predefined logic. By modifying these scripts, an attacker can alter the robot's behavior. For instance, in `5_line_follower.py`, changing the servo control lines (`servo_left.throttle = 0.1 * line_left.value` and `servo_right.throttle = -0.15 * line_right.value`) to fixed values or introducing different logic can completely override the line-following behavior.
  - No Security Checks: There are no security checks or validation mechanisms within the provided code or the standard CircuitPython setup to verify the integrity or source of the Python code being executed. The system trusts any `.py` files present on the `CIRCUITPY` drive.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Set up the MINT Line Follower robot kit according to the provided instructions, including flashing CircuitPython and copying the original code examples (e.g., `5_line_follower.py`).
  2. Verify that the robot operates as expected with the original `5_line_follower.py` code, correctly following a line.
  3. Create a malicious Python script named `code.py` (or modify `5_line_follower.py` directly and rename it to `code.py` to ensure it's executed by default). This malicious script should override the intended robot behavior with a harmful or unexpected action. For example, a simple malicious script could be:
     ```python
     from adafruit_motor import servo
     import board
     import pwmio
     import time

     servo_left = servo.ContinuousServo(pwmio.PWMOut(board.D0, frequency=50))
     servo_right = servo.ContinuousServo(pwmio.PWMOut(board.D6, frequency=50))

     while True:
         servo_left.throttle = 1.0   # Full speed forward for left servo
         servo_right.throttle = -1.0  # Full speed forward for right servo
         time.sleep(0.1)
     ```
  4. Connect the Xiao RP2040 microcontroller to a computer via USB. The `CIRCUITPY` drive should appear.
  5. Replace the existing `code.py` (or `5_line_follower.py` if you modified that) on the `CIRCUITPY` drive with the malicious `code.py` script created in step 3.
  6. Safely eject the `CIRCUITPY` drive and disconnect the USB cable.
  7. Power on the robot or press the reset button on the Xiao RP2040.
  8. Observe the robot's behavior. Instead of following a line, the robot should now move forward at maximum speed in a straight line (or potentially veer off course due to slight motor imbalances or surface irregularities), ignoring any line sensors. This demonstrates that the malicious code has successfully overridden the intended functionality and taken control of the robot's motors, confirming the Malicious Code Injection vulnerability.
