### 1. Lack of Input Validation in Camera Parameter Creation

- Description:
    1. The `jaxcam.Camera.create` function in `jaxcam/_src/camera.py` is used to instantiate `Camera` objects.
    2. This function accepts various parameters such as `focal_length`, `principal_point`, `image_size`, `skew`, `pixel_aspect_ratio`, `radial_distortion`, and `tangential_distortion` to define the camera model.
    3. However, the `create` function does not implement any validation or sanitization of these input parameters.
    4. An attacker could provide maliciously crafted or out-of-range values for these parameters during camera creation.
    5. For example, an attacker might provide extremely large values for `focal_length` or negative values for `image_size`.
    6. When these maliciously crafted camera objects are used in subsequent projection or related calculations, they can lead to incorrect or unexpected results.
    7. Applications relying on `jaxcam` for accurate camera modeling in security-sensitive contexts could be vulnerable if they use camera objects created with untrusted or unvalidated parameters.

- Impact:
    - Incorrect projection calculations.
    - Misrepresentation of the camera model.
    - Potential security vulnerabilities in applications that depend on accurate camera models for security tasks, such as AR/VR applications, robotics, or security systems, where incorrect projections could lead to bypassing security measures or misinterpreting the environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not include any input validation for camera parameters in the `Camera.create` function.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation should be added to the `Camera.create` function to check for reasonable ranges and valid types for all camera parameters.
    - For instance, `focal_length`, `image_size`, and `pixel_aspect_ratio` should be positive values.
    - Range checks for distortion coefficients might also be beneficial to prevent extreme values.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to control the input parameters passed to the `jaxcam.Camera.create` function. This could occur if the camera parameters are loaded from an external, untrusted source, or if a higher-level application does not properly sanitize user-provided camera settings before using `jaxcam`.

    - As seen in the code, there are no checks on the values of `focal_length`, `principal_point`, `image_size`, `skew`, `pixel_aspect_ratio`, `radial_distortion`, or `tangential_distortion`. The function directly uses the provided values to create the `Camera` object.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Import the `jaxcam` library.
    2. Create a `Camera` object with an extremely large focal length, e.g., `focal_length=jnp.array([1e10])`.
    3. Define a set of 3D points, e.g., `points = jnp.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])`.
    4. Project these points using the created camera: `pixels = jaxcam.project(camera, points)`.
    5. Print the resulting `pixels`.
    6. Compare these pixel coordinates to the expected pixel coordinates if a valid `focal_length` (e.g., `512`) were used. The pixel coordinates should be drastically different, demonstrating the impact of the malicious `focal_length`.
    7. Repeat steps 2-6 with other malicious parameters such as negative `image_size` or extreme `radial_distortion` coefficients and observe the output of projection and other camera operations.
