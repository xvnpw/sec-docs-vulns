- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated CRS/Projection/Geometry Parameters

- Description:
    1. An attacker can trick a user into opening a malicious Earth Engine dataset using Xee.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious dataset or manipulates dataset opening parameters (crs, projection, geometry) to include unexpected or invalid values.
    3. The user opens this dataset using Xarray with the Xee backend, passing the malicious parameters or defaults.
    4. Xee backend does not sufficiently validate the crs, projection, or geometry parameters before sending requests to Google Earth Engine.
    5. Google Earth Engine processes the request with these unvalidated parameters.
    6. Depending on the nature of the invalid parameters, this could lead to unexpected behavior in data processing within Google Earth Engine.
    7. In a worst-case scenario, this could potentially lead to information disclosure if the backend processing errors expose internal data or if incorrect geometry/projection parameters allow access to data outside the intended scope, although information disclosure is less likely in this specific scenario and more likely to cause data corruption or errors.

- Impact:
    - Medium: The vulnerability could lead to unexpected errors, data corruption or potentially expose error messages that might reveal information about the backend processing. While direct information disclosure is less likely through CRS/Projection/Geometry manipulation, unexpected behavior and potential backend errors are still concerning.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not explicitly validate the `crs`, `projection`, or `geometry` parameters passed to `xarray.open_dataset` before sending requests to Google Earth Engine. The parameters are passed directly to the Earth Engine API.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement validation for `crs`, `projection`, and `geometry` parameters in the `EarthEngineBackendEntrypoint.open_dataset` method.
        - For `crs`, validate against a list of allowed CRS values or use a CRS parsing library to check for validity.
        - For `projection`, check if it's a valid `ee.Projection` object.
        - For `geometry`, check if it's a valid `ee.Geometry` object or a valid bounding box tuple.
        - Sanitize or normalize these parameters before sending them to Google Earth Engine.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must be tricked into opening a maliciously crafted or unexpected Earth Engine dataset using Xee.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of Earth Engine datasets and Xee parameters to craft malicious inputs.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/xee/ext.py`
    - Function: `EarthEngineBackendEntrypoint.open_dataset`
    - Code flow:
        ```python
        def open_dataset(
            self,
            filename_or_obj: Union[str, os.PathLike[Any], ee.ImageCollection],
            ...
            crs: Optional[str] = None,
            scale: Union[float, int, None] = None,
            projection: Optional[ee.Projection] = None,
            geometry: ee.Geometry | Tuple[float, float, float, float] | None = None,
            ...
        ) -> xarray.Dataset:
            ...
            store = EarthEngineStore.open(
                collection,
                chunk_store=io_chunks,
                n_images=n_images,
                crs=crs, # User provided crs
                scale=scale, # User provided scale
                projection=projection, # User provided projection
                geometry=geometry, # User provided geometry
                ...
            )
            ...
        ```
    - The `open_dataset` function in `EarthEngineBackendEntrypoint` directly passes the user-provided `crs`, `scale`, `projection`, and `geometry` parameters to the `EarthEngineStore.open` method.
    - File: `/code/xee/ext.py`
    - Function: `EarthEngineStore.__init__`
    - Code flow:
        ```python
        def __init__(
            self,
            image_collection: ee.ImageCollection,
            chunks: Chunks = None,
            n_images: int = -1,
            crs: Optional[str] = None, # Potentially unvalidated crs
            scale: Union[float, int, None] = None, # Potentially unvalidated scale
            projection: Optional[ee.Projection] = None, # Potentially unvalidated projection
            geometry: ee.Geometry | Tuple[float, float, float, float] | None = None, # Potentially unvalidated geometry
            ...
        ):
            ...
            self.crs_arg = crs or proj.get('crs', proj.get('wkt', 'EPSG:4326')) # Using user provided crs or default
            self.crs = CRS(self.crs_arg) # Creating CRS object without validation
            ...
            default_scale = self.SCALE_UNITS.get(self.scale_units, 1)
            if scale is None:
              scale = default_scale # Using default scale if not provided
            ...
            self.bounds = self._determine_bounds(geometry=geometry) # Using user provided geometry
            ...
        ```
    - The `EarthEngineStore.__init__` method uses these parameters to initialize the store and directly uses them in subsequent requests to Google Earth Engine without explicit validation against allowed or expected values. This lack of validation could allow an attacker to inject unexpected values.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Assume a user is using Xee to open Earth Engine datasets.
    2. **Craft Malicious Input**: Prepare a malicious Earth Engine dataset ID or find a public dataset. Then, construct a Python script that uses Xarray and Xee to open this dataset, but provide an extremely large `scale` value (e.g., `scale=1e10`) when calling `xr.open_dataset`.
    3. **Execute Malicious Request**: Run the Python script, which will use Xee to send a request to Google Earth Engine with the specified large scale.
    4. **Observe Behavior**: Monitor the execution for unexpected errors, unusually long processing times, or any other abnormal behavior. Check if the resulting dataset in Xarray is corrupted or contains unexpected data.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: The test should demonstrate that Xee does not validate the `scale` parameter and passes it directly to Earth Engine. While this test case may not directly lead to information disclosure, it highlights the lack of input validation, which is a security concern. A more sophisticated attacker might be able to find parameter combinations that trigger more severe issues on the Earth Engine backend.
