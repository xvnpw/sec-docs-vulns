Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to process. I need the list of vulnerabilities to update it according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Analyze each vulnerability** against the attack vector and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2.  **Filter the list**, keeping only the valid, relevant, and high/critical vulnerabilities.
3.  **Format the output** in markdown, including all the requested details for each vulnerability.
4.  **Return the updated list** or an empty list if no vulnerabilities meet the criteria.

Looking forward to receiving the vulnerability list!
