- vulnerability name: CSV/TSV Data Injection leading to GMC Product Data Manipulation
- description: |
  The FeedLoader processes CSV/TSV feed files to upload product data to Google Merchant Center (GMC). If the application fails to properly sanitize or validate the content of these feed files, an attacker could inject malicious data within the CSV/TSV files. When FeedLoader processes these files, the malicious data could be passed to the GMC Content API, potentially leading to the manipulation of product data within Google Merchant Center. This could include modifying product titles, descriptions, prices, links, or other attributes in a way that is not intended by the GMC account owner.
- impact: |
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate product listings in Google Merchant Center. This might lead to:
  - **Defacement of product listings:** Displaying incorrect or misleading information to customers.
  - **Reputation damage:**  Negative impact on brand image due to manipulated listings.
  - **Financial loss:**  Incorrect pricing or product information could lead to loss of sales or unexpected costs.
  - **Legal and compliance issues:**  Displaying illegal or inappropriate content.
- vulnerability rank: Medium
- currently implemented mitigations:
  - The project relies on configuration via `feed_schema_config.json` to map CSV headers to BigQuery columns and Content API fields. This configuration, if correctly set up, dictates the structure of the expected data, but it doesn't inherently sanitize the data *content* against malicious payloads.
  - The documentation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the naming and order of headers in the CSV/TSV files match the `feed_schema_config.json` exactly to prevent data corruption in GMC, suggesting an awareness of data integrity but not explicitly security against malicious injection.
- missing mitigations: |
  - **Input validation:** Implement robust validation of data read from CSV/TSV files. This should include checks for data type, format, length, and allowed characters for each field based on the expected schema and GMC Content API requirements.
  - **Data sanitization:** Sanitize data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences before processing and sending it to the GMC Content API. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While less relevant for a backend data pipeline, if any part of FeedLoader generates web-based reports or interfaces, implementing CSP would be important to prevent XSS in those components (though not directly related to CSV injection attack vector).
- preconditions: |
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide or modify the CSV/TSV feed files that are processed by FeedLoader. This could be achieved if the attacker has access to the system or storage location where feed files are stored before being processed, or if the system is designed to ingest feeds from potentially untrusted external sources without proper security controls.
- source code analysis: |
  To confirm and further detail this vulnerability, a source code review is necessary, specifically focusing on:
  - **File parsing logic:** How FeedLoader parses CSV/TSV files. Does it use libraries that are known to be vulnerable to injection if not used correctly?
  - **Data mapping and transformation:**  How data from CSV/TSV is mapped to internal data structures and then to the GMC Content API format. Are there any steps where data is directly passed without sanitization?
  - **GMC API interaction:** How FeedLoader constructs and sends requests to the GMC Content API. Is the data properly encoded and escaped before API calls?
  - **Error handling:** How FeedLoader handles invalid or unexpected data during processing. Does it fail safely or could errors be exploited?
  Without the source code, this analysis is based on the project's description and common data processing vulnerabilities.
- security test case: |
  1. **Prepare a malicious CSV/TSV file:** Create a CSV/TSV file that includes potentially malicious data in one or more fields. Examples of malicious data could include:
     - For text fields:  Attempt to inject HTML or Javascript code, or special characters that might be interpreted by GMC in unintended ways. For example, in the `title` or `description` fields, include strings like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` or `\";malicious_code;\"`.
     - For numeric fields (if processed as strings before API submission):  Inject strings that are not valid numbers or that could cause issues when processed by GMC.
  2. **Upload the malicious feed file:** Place this malicious CSV/TSV file in the designated feed bucket (`FEED_BUCKET`) where FeedLoader expects to find feed files.
  3. **Trigger FeedLoader processing:** Upload an empty "EOF" file to the update bucket (`UPDATE_BUCKET`) to initiate the FeedLoader workflow.
  4. **Monitor GMC Product Listings:** After FeedLoader has processed the files (allow sufficient time for processing and API calls), check the product listings in Google Merchant Center associated with the Merchant ID used by FeedLoader.
  5. **Verify Manipulation:** Check if the product data in GMC has been manipulated as intended by the injected malicious data. Look for signs of injected scripts being executed (if possible in GMC context, though less likely), unexpected characters in fields, or other forms of data corruption or unintended changes in the product listings.
  6. **Analyze Logs:** Review the logs of FeedLoader components (Cloud Functions, App Engine) to see if any errors were logged during the processing of the malicious file, which could indicate attempts to sanitize or reject the malicious data, or if the data was processed without any warnings.

  If the product data in GMC is successfully manipulated by the malicious content in the CSV/TSV file, and no errors indicating input validation failures are observed in FeedLoader's logs, then the vulnerability is confirmed.
