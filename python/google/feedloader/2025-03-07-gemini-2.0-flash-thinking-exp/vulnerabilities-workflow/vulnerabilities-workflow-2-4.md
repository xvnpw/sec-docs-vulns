- vulnerability name: CSV Injection
  - description: |
    An attacker can inject malicious code into CSV or TSV feed files. When FeedLoader processes these files, specifically in the `import_storage_file_into_big_query` Cloud Function, and subsequently sends the data to Google Merchant Center, there's a risk that Google Merchant Center might interpret certain data fields as formulas if they start with characters like '=', '@', '+', or '-'. This could lead to CSV injection vulnerabilities within the Google Merchant Center platform itself.

    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how an attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability:
    1.  The attacker crafts a malicious CSV or TSV file. This file includes specially formatted strings in one or more columns that are intended to be interpreted as formulas by spreadsheet software or similar data processing tools. For example, a product title field might be set to `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0`.
    2.  The attacker uploads this malicious feed file to the Cloud Storage bucket designated for feed files (`FEED_BUCKET`).
    3.  The `import_storage_file_into_big_query` Cloud Function is triggered by the file upload. This function reads the feed file and loads the data into BigQuery.
    4.  The data from BigQuery, including the potentially injected formulas, is then processed by the App Engine `uploader` service.
    5.  The `uploader` service constructs Content API calls and sends product data, including the un-sanitized malicious formulas, to Google Merchant Center.
    6.  If Google Merchant Center's data processing or rendering logic is vulnerable to CSV injection, it might interpret and execute these formulas, potentially leading to unintended actions within the Merchant Center account, such as data modification or disruption of service presentation in the GMC interface.

    This attack leverages the data flow of FeedLoader to inject potentially harmful payloads into Google Merchant Center, relying on a hypothetical vulnerability within the GMC platform's handling of feed data.
  - impact: |
    The impact of a CSV Injection vulnerability in this context could range from benign to moderately severe, depending on Google Merchant Center's susceptibility to such attacks:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** If GMC's interface renders the injected formulas without proper sanitization, sensitive information intended to be hidden or processed internally might be revealed to users viewing the Merchant Center, although this is less likely given the described attack vector.
    *   **Data Modification:** More critically, if Google Merchant Center processes these formulas in a way that allows for data manipulation, an attacker could potentially alter product listings, descriptions, prices, or other attributes in unintended ways. This could lead to incorrect product information being displayed to customers, impacting sales and brand reputation.
    *   **Account Disruption:** In a worst-case scenario, if the vulnerability is severe, it might be theoretically possible to disrupt the normal operation of the Merchant Center account, although denial of service is explicitly excluded as a focus. The more realistic impact is unintended modification or corruption of product data.

    Given the context, the most probable and relevant impact is the potential for unintended modifications or disruptions of product listings within Google Merchant Center, leading to data integrity issues and potential misrepresentation of products to customers.
  - vulnerability rank: Medium
  - currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided code to prevent CSV Injection. The code focuses on data loading and transfer but lacks input sanitization for formula injection.
  - missing mitigations: |
    The project is missing crucial input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent CSV Injection vulnerabilities. The following mitigations are recommended:
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation in the `import_storage_file_into_big_query` Cloud Function. This should include:
        *   Scanning feed data for common CSV injection characters at the beginning of fields (e.g., '=', '@', '+', '-').
        *   Using secure CSV/TSV parsing libraries that offer options to disable formula execution or treat all input as literal strings.
        *   Sanitizing or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as formula components by spreadsheet software or web applications.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While FeedLoader itself is a backend application, if any part of it serves content to web browsers (which is not evident from the provided files but is a general security best practice), implementing a strong Content Security Policy for the Google Merchant Center domain could help mitigate the impact of CSV injection by restricting the execution of inline scripts and other potentially harmful content. However, this is a mitigation on the receiving platform (GMC), not within FeedLoader itself.
  - preconditions: |
    To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to:
    1.  Have the ability to create and upload files to the Cloud Storage bucket that FeedLoader monitors for feed files (`FEED_BUCKET`). This precondition is typically met by external attackers who are meant to upload feed files for processing.
    2.  Craft a malicious CSV or TSV file containing CSV injection payloads within the data fields.
    3.  Assume that the Google Merchant Center platform is vulnerable to CSV injection and will process the injected formulas in a harmful way when it receives and processes data from FeedLoader.
  - source code analysis: |
    To analyze the source code for CSV Injection vulnerability, we need to examine the `import_storage_file_into_big_query` Cloud Function, particularly how it handles CSV/TSV parsing and data loading into BigQuery.

    1.  **File: `/code/cloud_functions/gcs-bq-feed-load/main.py`**

    ```python
    def _perform_bigquery_load(
        bucket_name: str, filename: str,
        items_table_bq_schema: Collection[bigquery.SchemaField]) -> None:
        ...
        bigquery_job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig(
            allow_jagged_rows=True,
            encoding='UTF-8',
            field_delimiter='\t', # <-- Field delimiter is set to Tab for TSV, but CSV is also accepted
            quote_character='', # <-- quote_character is empty
            schema=items_table_bq_schema,
            skip_leading_rows=1,
            source_format=bigquery.SourceFormat.CSV, # <-- Source format is CSV
            time_partitioning=bigquery.table.TimePartitioning(
                type_=_TABLE_PARTITION_GRANULARITY,
                expiration_ms=_ITEMS_TABLE_EXPIRATION_DURATION_MS),
            write_disposition='WRITE_APPEND',
        )

        gcs_uri = f'gs://{bucket_name}/{filename}'
        feed_table_path = f"{os.environ.get('BQ_DATASET')}.items"

        bigquery_load_job = bigquery_client.load_table_from_uri(
            gcs_uri, feed_table_path, job_config=bigquery_job_config)
        ...
    ```

    -   The `_perform_bigquery_load` function uses `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` to load data from GCS to BigQuery.
    -   `source_format=bigquery.SourceFormat.CSV` indicates that the function is configured to handle CSV files. Although the README mentions TSV is also supported, and `field_delimiter='\t'` is set, the `SourceFormat.CSV` might imply CSV-specific parsing rules are applied.
    -   `quote_character=''` is set to an empty string, meaning quotes are not treated specially, which is generally safer against CSV injection compared to some quoting modes, but doesn't prevent formula injection if GMC is vulnerable.
    -   **Crucially, there is no explicit sanitization or validation of the data being loaded.** The function assumes the input feed files are safe and conform to the expected schema.

    2.  **Absence of Sanitization:**

    -   Reviewing the provided code files, including `install_to_gcp.sh`, `env.sh`, `appengine` and `cloud_functions` code, there is no evidence of any input sanitization or output encoding being applied to the feed data at any stage within FeedLoader before it is sent to Google Merchant Center.
    -   The `feed_schema_config.json` configuration is for mapping CSV headers to BigQuery columns and defining data types but does not include any validation or sanitization rules.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Attacker Malicious Feed File] --> B(Feed Bucket in GCS);
        B --> C(import_storage_file_into_big_query Cloud Function);
        C --> D(BigQuery 'items' table);
        D --> E(uploader App Engine Service);
        E --> F(Google Merchant Center Content API);
        F --> G[Google Merchant Center Platform];
        G --> H[Potential CSV Injection Vulnerability in GMC];
    ```

    **Conclusion:**

    The source code analysis confirms that FeedLoader, as implemented, does not include any specific mitigations against CSV Injection. It reads and forwards feed data to Google Merchant Center without sanitizing or validating the content for potentially malicious formulas. This lack of sanitization, combined with the possibility of Google Merchant Center being vulnerable to CSV Injection, constitutes a valid vulnerability.

  - security test case: |
    **Vulnerability Test Case: CSV Injection**

    **Objective:**
    Verify if FeedLoader is vulnerable to CSV Injection by attempting to inject a formula through a feed file and observing if Google Merchant Center processes it.

    **Preconditions:**
    1.  FeedLoader must be installed and configured in a GCP project, as per the Setup Guide.
    2.  Access to upload files to the FeedLoader's designated feed bucket.
    3.  Access to a Google Merchant Center account to observe the product listings.

    **Test Steps:**

    1.  **Create a Malicious CSV Feed File:**
        -   Create a new text file named `malicious_feed.csv`.
        -   Add the following content to `malicious_feed.csv`. This CSV file includes a malicious formula `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0` in the `description` field of one item.
            ```csv
            id,title,description,link,image_link,availability,price,brand,gtin
            test-item-001,Test Product Title,Malicious Description =cmd|'/C calc'!A0,https://example.com/product1,https://example.com/product1.jpg,in stock,10.00,TestBrand,1234567890
            test-item-002,Normal Product Title,Normal Description,https://example.com/product2,https://example.com/product2.jpg,in stock,20.00,AnotherBrand,0987654321
            ```
        -   Save and close the `malicious_feed.csv` file.

    2.  **Upload the Malicious Feed File:**
        -   Using `gsutil`, upload `malicious_feed.csv` to your FeedLoader's feed bucket (`FEED_BUCKET`). Replace `[FEED_BUCKET_PATH]` with your actual bucket path and `[PATH_TO_MALICIOUS_FEED]` with the path to your `malicious_feed.csv` file.
            ```bash
            gsutil cp -j csv [PATH_TO_MALICIOUS_FEED]/malicious_feed.csv [FEED_BUCKET_PATH]
            ```

    3.  **Trigger FeedLoader Processing:**
        -   Create an empty file named `EOF` in your local directory.
            ```bash
            touch EOF
            ```
        -   Upload the empty `EOF` file to the update bucket (`UPDATE_BUCKET`). Replace `[UPDATE_BUCKET_PATH]` with your actual bucket path and `[PATH_TO_EOF]` with the path to your `EOF` file.
            ```bash
            gsutil cp [PATH_TO_EOF]/EOF [UPDATE_BUCKET_PATH]
            ```

    4.  **Monitor Google Merchant Center:**
        -   Wait for FeedLoader to process the feed (this might take a few minutes).
        -   Log in to your Google Merchant Center account.
        -   Navigate to the 'Products' -> 'List' section.
        -   Search for 'test-item-001' to find the product created from the malicious feed.
        -   Examine the product details, especially the 'description' field.

    5.  **Observe for CSV Injection Behavior:**
        -   **Successful Injection (if GMC is vulnerable):**
            -   Look for any unusual behavior in the Google Merchant Center interface when viewing the product details. For instance, if the formula was executed, you might see:
                -   Unexpected modifications in the product data if formulas can alter data.
                -   JavaScript errors or unusual rendering issues in the GMC interface if the formula is interpreted in a client-side context.
                -   No visible change on the GMC frontend likely means GMC is not directly vulnerable to frontend CSV Injection in the product description display. However, backend processing might still be vulnerable, which is harder to observe directly through the UI for this specific formula type.
        -   **No Injection (FeedLoader is safe OR GMC is not vulnerable):**
            -   The 'description' field in Google Merchant Center will literally display the string `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0` without any attempt to execute it as a formula.
            -   The product listing appears normal, without any signs of unusual behavior or errors in GMC.

    6.  **Check Logs (Important):**
        -   Go to Google Cloud Logging and check the logs for the `import_storage_file_into_big_query` Cloud Function and the App Engine `uploader` service.
        -   Look for any error messages, warnings, or unusual entries that might indicate issues during feed processing related to the injected formula.

    7.  **Clean Up:**
        -   In Google Merchant Center, delete the test products ('test-item-001' and 'test-item-002') to clean up your product listings.
        -   Optionally, delete the `malicious_feed.csv` and `EOF` files from your Cloud Storage buckets.

    **Expected Result:**
    Ideally, the test should show that Google Merchant Center treats the injected formula as plain text, and FeedLoader processes the file without issues, indicating no CSV Injection vulnerability. However, if you observe any unexpected behavior in GMC or errors in FeedLoader logs, it might indicate a vulnerability.

    **Note:** This test case primarily checks for CSV Injection as it might manifest in Google Merchant Center. Backend CSV injection vulnerabilities that are not directly visible in the UI would require more specialized testing and potentially access to backend logs or monitoring of GMC's internal systems, which is beyond the scope of typical external security testing for FeedLoader.
