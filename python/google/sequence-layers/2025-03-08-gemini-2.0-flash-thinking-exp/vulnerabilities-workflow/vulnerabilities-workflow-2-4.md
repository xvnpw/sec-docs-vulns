- vulnerability name: Insecure Custom SequenceLayer Instantiation via Protobuf API
- description: An attacker can exploit the protobuf API to register and instantiate custom SequenceLayers with malicious configurations. This vulnerability arises because the factory functions, responsible for creating instances of custom SequenceLayers from protobuf specifications, might lack proper input validation and sanitization. By crafting a malicious protobuf message and registering a vulnerable factory function, an attacker can inject arbitrary parameters during the instantiation of a `CustomLayer`. This can lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful behavior depending on how these parameters are used within the custom layer's implementation.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1. Define a malicious `CustomLayer` in a custom protobuf message (`custom_proto.proto`) that is designed to perform harmful actions when instantiated with specific parameters. For example, the `CustomLayer` could execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources based on its input parameters.
  2. Create a factory function (`_build_custom_layer`) that registers this `CustomLayer` for use with the protobuf API. This factory function should **not** sanitize or validate the input `spec` (protobuf message) before using it to instantiate the `CustomLayer`.
  3. Register the vulnerable factory function using `@slp.register_factory(custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer)`.
  4. Craft a malicious protobuf message (`spec`) that, when processed by the registered factory function, will instantiate the `CustomLayer` with parameters that trigger the malicious behavior. This crafted message would be designed to exploit the lack of input validation in the factory function.
  5. Send this crafted protobuf message to the system through the protobuf API.
  6. The system's `build_sequence_layer` function will use the registered factory function to instantiate the `CustomLayer` based on the malicious protobuf message.
  7. If the `CustomLayer` and factory function are vulnerable (due to missing input sanitization), the malicious code or behavior will be executed during layer instantiation or subsequent usage.

- impact: The impact of this vulnerability can range from arbitrary code execution to other unforeseen security flaws, depending on the specifics of the malicious `CustomLayer` implementation and the context in which the library is used. If an attacker can control the parameters of a `CustomLayer` instantiation, they can potentially:
  * Achieve arbitrary code execution on the server or machine running the TensorFlow model.
  * Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.
  * Cause denial of service by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources.
  * Manipulate the behavior of the machine learning model in unintended ways, leading to incorrect or biased outputs.
- vulnerability rank: Critical
- currently implemented mitigations: No mitigations are currently implemented in the provided code to prevent this vulnerability. The `README.md` provides instructions on how to register custom layers but does not mention any security considerations or best practices for validating and sanitizing input protobuf specifications within factory functions.
- missing mitigations: The project is missing input validation and sanitization for custom SequenceLayer factory functions. Mitigations should include:
  * Input validation: Factory functions should thoroughly validate all input parameters from the protobuf `spec` before using them to instantiate `CustomLayer` objects. This validation should ensure that parameters are within expected ranges, formats, and types, and should reject any invalid or suspicious inputs.
  * Input sanitization: Factory functions should sanitize input parameters to prevent injection attacks. This might involve escaping special characters, encoding data, or using other appropriate sanitization techniques depending on how the parameters are used within the `CustomLayer`.
  * Security guidelines: The project documentation should include clear security guidelines for developers who register custom SequenceLayers. These guidelines should emphasize the importance of input validation and sanitization in factory functions and provide examples of secure coding practices.
- preconditions:
  * The project's protobuf API is enabled and accessible to attackers.
  * The attacker has identified or can create a custom SequenceLayer with a vulnerable factory function registration. This could involve social engineering, exploiting existing vulnerabilities to register a malicious layer, or compromising the system to inject a vulnerable registration.
  * The system using this library attempts to instantiate a SequenceLayer based on a protobuf specification that is either directly provided by an attacker or influenced by attacker-controlled data.

  ### Custom SequenceLayers and the proto API.

  Registering your own custom SequenceLayers for use in the protocol buffer API is
  possible via the use of protocol buffer extensions.

  Simply define a custom proto message for your SequenceLayer:

  ```proto
  // custom_proto.proto
  import "third_party/py/sequence_layers/proto.proto";

  message CustomLayer {
    optional float param = 1;
    optional string name = 2;
  }

  extend sequence_layers.SequenceLayer {
    optional CustomLayer custom_layer = 344129823;
  }
  ```

  Then register a factory function to tell `build_sequence_layer` how to
  instantiate the layer from configuration:

  ```python
  from sequence_layers import proto as slp

  @slp.register_factory(custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer)
  def _build_custom_layer(spec: custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer) -> CustomLayer:
    return CustomLayer(spec.param, spec.name)
  ```

  * Analysis:*
    The `README.md` file outlines how to register custom `SequenceLayers` using a protobuf API. The example shows a factory function `_build_custom_layer` that directly uses `spec.param` and `spec.name` to instantiate a `CustomLayer`. This is a potential vulnerability point because:
      1. The `@slp.register_factory` mechanism does not inherently enforce any input validation or sanitization on the `spec` argument passed to the factory function.
      2. The example factory function `_build_custom_layer` directly uses the values from the `spec` without any validation. If the `CustomLayer` constructor or subsequent layer logic processes `spec.param` or `spec.name` in an unsafe manner (e.g., executing them as code, using them in system calls, or accessing files based on them), it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
      3. An attacker who can control the protobuf message (e.g., by modifying a configuration file, intercepting network traffic, or through other injection points) can potentially provide malicious values for `spec.param` and `spec.name` and compromise the system.
      4. The documentation does not warn developers about the security risks of registering custom layers and the importance of input validation.

- security test case:
  1. Prerequisites:
      * Assume that the project is deployed in a publicly accessible environment where an attacker can send protobuf messages to trigger layer instantiation.
      * Assume there is a `CustomLayer` defined as follows (or similar):

      ```python
      class CustomLayer(sl.Stateless):
          def __init__(self, param, name, **kwargs):
              super().__init__(**kwargs)
              self.param = param
              self.name = name

          def get_output_shape(self, input_shape, constants=None):
              return input_shape

          def layer(self, x, training, initial_state=None, constants=None):
              # Insecure use of name parameter, e.g., for file access or command execution
              print(f"Custom Layer Name: {self.name}")
              # Insecure use of param parameter that could lead to issues based on type or value.
              if self.param > 1000:
                  raise ValueError("Parameter is too large")
              return x
      ```
      * Assume the factory function is registered as shown in `README.md` example, without input validation:

      ```python
      @slp.register_factory(custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer) # Assuming custom_proto_pb2 is defined
      def _build_custom_layer(spec: custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer) -> CustomLayer:
        return CustomLayer(spec.param, spec.name)
      ```
  2. Steps:
      * An attacker crafts a malicious protobuf message (`malicious_spec`) for `CustomLayer`. This message contains a specially crafted `name` parameter designed to be potentially harmful when printed or processed by the `CustomLayer`. For example, `spec.name = "$(malicious_command)"`.
      * The attacker sends this `malicious_spec` to the system through the protobuf API, triggering the instantiation of `CustomLayer` using the vulnerable factory function.
  3. Expected result:
      * If the system is vulnerable, printing `self.name` could lead to command injection depending on how the system handles the printed output. Even without command injection, if `CustomLayer` or the factory function attempts to use `spec.name` or `spec.param` in other insecure ways (like file path manipulation, SQL injection if used in database queries within the layer, etc.), it can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
      * For the parameter validation example in `CustomLayer`, if `spec.param` is set to a value greater than 1000 in `malicious_spec`, the instantiation or layer execution will raise a `ValueError`, demonstrating that unsanitized inputs from the protobuf message are directly affecting the layer's behavior and can be used to trigger errors.
  4. Mitigation:
      * Implement input validation and sanitization in the `_build_custom_layer` factory function to check the `spec.param` and `spec.name` fields for potentially malicious content before instantiating the `CustomLayer`. For example:

      ```python
      @slp.register_factory(custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer)
      def _build_custom_layer(spec: custom_proto_pb2.CustomLayer) -> CustomLayer:
          if not isinstance(spec.param, float):
              raise ValueError("Invalid param type")
          if not isinstance(spec.name, str) or not spec.name.isalnum(): # Example sanitization
              raise ValueError("Invalid name format")
          return CustomLayer(spec.param, spec.name)
      ```
      * After implementing the mitigation, re-running the security test case with the malicious protobuf message should no longer trigger the vulnerability. Instead, the system should reject the malicious message due to validation errors in the factory function.
