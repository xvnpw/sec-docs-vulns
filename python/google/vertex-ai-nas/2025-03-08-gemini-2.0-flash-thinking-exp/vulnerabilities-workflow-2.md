- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Handling of Training Data Paths in Tutorials

- Description:
  1. The tutorials, specifically `third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial1.md` and `third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial4.md`, instruct users to pass training data paths as command-line arguments to the `vertex_nas_cli.py` script.
  2. For example, in `third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial1.md`, the training command includes flags like `--local_data_dir` and `--root_output_dir` which can be GCS paths. Similarly, `third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial4.md` uses `--root_output_dir` for cloud training jobs.
  3. These paths are directly used by the NAS code, including trainer dockers, to access training data.
  4. An attacker could potentially manipulate these publicly available tutorial instructions to inject malicious GCS paths, pointing to attacker-controlled datasets.
  5. If a user, following the tutorial, inadvertently uses a malicious data path provided by an attacker (e.g., through a modified tutorial or forum post), the NAS training process will use this poisoned data.
  6. This could lead to data poisoning attacks where the NAS service trains models on attacker-controlled data, resulting in backdoors or biases in the generated models.

- Impact:
    - Data Poisoning: An attacker can influence the training process by providing malicious training data, leading to compromised models with backdoors or biases.
    - Compromised Model Integrity: Models generated by Vertex AI NAS may be unreliable and insecure due to training on poisoned data.
    - Reputational Damage: Google Vertex AI NAS reputation could be damaged if users unknowingly deploy vulnerable models trained using these tutorials and are subsequently attacked.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The tutorials directly instruct users to provide GCS paths without explicit warnings about data source verification or sanitization. The code itself within the provided snippets doesn't implement input validation for these paths in the context of the tutorials.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Security Warnings: Add prominent security warnings in the tutorials, explicitly advising users to:
        - Carefully verify the source and integrity of any training data, especially when using externally provided instructions or configurations.
        - Use data from trusted and controlled GCS buckets.
        - Be cautious about executing commands from untrusted sources.
    - Documentation on Data Poisoning Risks: Include a dedicated section in the documentation explaining the risks of data poisoning in NAS and how users can mitigate these risks.

- Preconditions:
    - User follows publicly available tutorials.
    - User inadvertently uses a malicious data path provided by an attacker through a modified tutorial or other means.
    - User has a Google Cloud project set up and is using Vertex AI NAS.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial1.md` and `/code/third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial4.md`
  2. These files contain instructions that guide users to run `vertex_nas_cli.py` with flags like `--local_data_dir`, `--root_output_dir`, and `--search_docker_flags` which can include data paths.
  3. For example, `vertex_tutorial1.md` shows commands like:
     ```sh
     python3 vertex_nas_cli.py search_in_local ... --local_data_dir=${DATA_DIR} ...
     python3 vertex_nas_cli.py search ... --root_output_dir=${GCS_ROOT_DIR} ...
     ```
  4. `vertex_tutorial4.md` also demonstrates similar commands using GCS paths.
  5. The `vertex_nas_cli.py` script (File: `/code/vertex_nas_cli.py`) processes these command-line arguments and passes them to the training jobs.
  6. The trainer code (e.g., `tutorial/tutorial1_mnist_search.py`) uses these paths to access data, as shown in the tutorial steps.
  7. There is no explicit input validation or sanitization of these paths in the provided tutorial code or `vertex_nas_cli.py` for the tutorial use cases.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Setup:
     - Create a benign Google Cloud project and set up Vertex AI NAS according to the tutorials.
     - Create a malicious GCS bucket (`gs://malicious-data-bucket`) controlled by the attacker.
     - In the malicious bucket, create a "poisoned" training dataset designed to introduce a backdoor into the trained model.
  2. Attacker Action:
     - Modify the tutorial instructions (e.g., on a public forum or a cloned repository) to replace the example GCS data paths with the attacker's malicious GCS path (`gs://malicious-data-bucket`).
     - For example, modify the `GCS_ROOT_DIR` in `vertex_tutorial1.md` to point to `gs://malicious-data-bucket`.
  3. User Action:
     - A user, following the modified tutorial, copies and pastes the commands, inadvertently using the attacker's malicious GCS path.
     - User runs the NAS search or training job using `vertex_nas_cli.py` with the malicious data path.
  4. Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation):
     - The Vertex AI NAS training job uses the data from `gs://malicious-data-bucket` for training.
     - The generated model (if training completes) exhibits backdoor behavior or biases as a result of the data poisoning attack.
     - The user's Vertex AI NAS project is now at risk of deploying compromised models.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in GCS Path Handling in Tutorial Code

- Description:
    An attacker can potentially exploit a path traversal vulnerability by crafting a malicious `job-dir` argument in the configuration, leading to unauthorized file access. The tutorial code in `vertex_tutorial1.md` instructs users to modify their trainer code to work with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) by converting GCS paths to local file paths using `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path(argv.job_dir)`. If the `argv.job_dir` is not properly validated before being passed to `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path`, an attacker could manipulate this argument to include path traversal characters (e.g., "..", "/") and potentially access files outside the intended job directory within the mounted GCS bucket.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1.  Assume an attacker has control over the `job-dir` parameter, possibly through a configuration file or command-line argument injection when launching a NAS job.
    2.  Set the `job-dir` parameter to a malicious path containing path traversal sequences, for example: `gs://your-bucket/../../sensitive_file`.
    3.  Run a NAS job that utilizes the vulnerable tutorial code from `vertex_tutorial1.md`, specifically the file I/O modifications in "2. Modify file I/O to work with the GCS location." section.
    4.  The `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path` function will convert the malicious path to `/gcs/your-bucket/../../sensitive_file`.
    5.  When the trainer code attempts to create or access files within the `job-dir`, it might inadvertently access files outside the intended job directory due to the path traversal sequence, depending on how the resulting path is used in subsequent file operations.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read or potentially write files within the GCS bucket associated with the Vertex AI NAS project, leading to:
        - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the bucket.
        - Data leakage or exfiltration.
        - Potential data modification or corruption, if write operations are performed based on the traversed path.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided code to prevent path traversal in the `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path` function or in the tutorial code that uses it. The code snippet in `vertex_tutorial1.md` focuses on converting GCS paths for GCS-Fuse compatibility but lacks input validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `job-dir` parameter before using it in file path operations. This should include checks to prevent path traversal sequences like "..", "/" and potentially restrict the path to a predefined directory or bucket.
    - Using secure file path handling functions that prevent path traversal, instead of directly manipulating strings.
    - Principle of least privilege should be applied to GCS access, ensuring the NAS service account only has access to the necessary buckets and directories.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control or influence the `job-dir` parameter used by the Vertex AI NAS code, for example by modifying a configuration file or command-line argument.
    - The Vertex AI NAS code must be executed in an environment where GCS-Fuse is used and the vulnerable tutorial code from `vertex_tutorial1.md` is implemented, specifically the file I/O modifications that use `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path`.

- Source Code Analysis:

    The vulnerability exists in the tutorial documentation file `/code/third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial1.md` and potentially in user implemented code based on this tutorial.

    1.  **File:** `/code/third_party/tutorial/vertex_tutorial1.md`
    2.  **Section:** "2. Modify file I/O to work with the GCS location."
    3.  **Code Snippet:**
        ```py
        argv.job_dir = gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path(argv.job_dir)
        ```
        This line of code, as part of the tutorial, encourages users to directly convert user-provided `argv.job_dir` to a GCS-Fuse path without any validation.

    4.  **File:** `/code/gcs_utils/gcs_path_utils.py`
        ```python
        def gcs_fuse_path(gcs_path):
          """Convert gs:// path to /gcs/ path."""
          if not gcs_path.startswith('gs://'):
            return gcs_path
          bucket_path = gcs_path[len('gs://'):]
          return os.path.join('/gcs/', bucket_path)
        ```
        The `gcs_fuse_path` function performs a simple string replacement and concatenation, and does not validate or sanitize the input `gcs_path`. It assumes the input is a valid GCS path starting with `gs://` but doesn't prevent path traversal characters within the path itself.

    5.  **Vulnerability Flow:**
        - User provides malicious `job-dir` e.g., `gs://your-bucket/../../sensitive_file`
        - `vertex_tutorial1.md` guides user to use `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path(argv.job_dir)`
        - `gcs_path_utils.gcs_fuse_path` converts it to `/gcs/your-bucket/../../sensitive_file` without validation
        - Subsequent file operations using `argv.job_dir` may traverse out of intended directory.


- Security Test Case:

    1.  **Setup:**
        - Deploy the Vertex AI NAS project in a test environment, including the tutorial code and dependencies.
        - Create a GCS bucket `gs://test-bucket-nas-path-traversal` within the project.
        - Create a sensitive file `gs://test-bucket-nas-path-traversal/sensitive_data.txt` with content "This is sensitive data.".
        - Create a configuration file or prepare command-line arguments for a NAS job, based on `vertex_tutorial1.md`.

    2.  **Attack Scenario:**
        - Modify the NAS job configuration to set the `job-dir` parameter to: `gs://test-bucket-nas-path-traversal/../../sensitive_data.txt`.
        - Run the NAS job using the modified configuration.
        - After the job execution (or during, if logs are accessible), check the job output logs or output directory for any indication of accessing `sensitive_data.txt`.
        - Alternatively, modify the `tutorial1_mnist_search.py` to explicitly read the file at `argv.job_dir` after the path conversion and log its content, to directly verify the path traversal.

    3.  **Expected Result:**
        - If the vulnerability is present, the test should demonstrate that the code attempts to access or operate on the `sensitive_data.txt` file, indicating successful path traversal.
        - For example, if the modified `tutorial1_mnist_search.py` tries to read and log the content of `argv.job_dir` after path conversion, the logs should contain the content of `sensitive_data.txt` instead of an expected directory listing or error related to the job's directory.

    4.  **Remediation:**
        - Implement input validation and sanitization for the `job-dir` parameter.
        - Update the tutorial to recommend secure path handling practices and emphasize the importance of input validation.

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization of Search Space

- Description:
    1. The `vertex_nas_cli.py` tool allows users to specify a `search_space_module` which points to a Python module defining the search space.
    2. When a search job is launched locally or on Google Cloud, the `vertex_nas_cli.py`  loads and deserializes this user-provided module using `importlib.import_module`.
    3. If a malicious user can control the `search_space_module` parameter, they can inject arbitrary Python code into the system. This code will be executed during the NAS job execution as the module is imported and its functions are called.

- Impact:
    *   **High/Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the NAS job. This could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access to cloud resources (Vertex AI environment), or denial of service. The impact is critical in cloud environments like Vertex AI where unauthorized access can have significant consequences.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None. The code directly imports and uses the user-provided module without any sanitization or security checks.

- Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate the `search_space_module` input to ensure it adheres to a strict whitelist of allowed modules or a safe subset of functionalities. Avoid directly importing and executing arbitrary user-supplied code.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Execute the NAS job and user-provided modules in a sandboxed or isolated environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control the `search_space_module` parameter when launching a NAS job. For example, in tutorial examples, this parameter is passed via command line. In a real-world scenario, this could be exploited if the application allows users to configure and launch NAS jobs and doesn't properly sanitize this input.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/vertex_nas_cli.py`
    2. **Function:** `search_in_local_parser`, `search_parser`, `train_parser` - these parsers all include `--search_space_module` flag.
    3. **Function:** `get_search_space(args)` in `/code/vertex_nas_cli.py`
    ```python
    def get_search_space(args):
        ...
        elif args.search_space_module:
            search_space_module = args.search_space_module
        ...
        search_space_file, search_space_mthod_name = search_space_module.rsplit(
            ".", 1)
        module = importlib.import_module(search_space_file) # Vulnerability Point
        method = getattr(module, search_space_mthod_name)
        return method()
    ```
    4. **Analysis:** The code uses `importlib.import_module(search_space_file)` to dynamically import a module specified by the user-controlled `search_space_module` argument. This allows arbitrary code execution if an attacker can provide a malicious module path.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker creates a malicious Python module (e.g., `malicious_search_space.py`) with the following content:**
    ```python
    import pyglove as pg
    import os

    def malicious_search_space():
        os.system("touch /tmp/pwned") # Malicious command execution
        return pg.one_of([1, 2])
    ```
    2. **Attacker places this file in a location where it can be accessed by the NAS client (e.g., in the same directory or a publicly accessible location).**
    3. **Attacker crafts a command to run a local NAS search, specifying the malicious module as the `search_space_module`:**
    ```sh
    python3 vertex_nas_cli.py search_in_local --project_id=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --trainer_docker_id=<DOCKER_ID> --region=<REGION> --search_space_module=malicious_search_space --local_output_dir=/tmp/nas_tutorial --search_docker_flags search_space='malicious_search_space'
    ```
    4. **Execute the command.**
    5. **Verification:** After running the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, it confirms that the malicious code from `malicious_search_space.py` was executed, proving the arbitrary code execution vulnerability. In a real Vertex AI environment, the attacker could perform actions within the project's scope.
