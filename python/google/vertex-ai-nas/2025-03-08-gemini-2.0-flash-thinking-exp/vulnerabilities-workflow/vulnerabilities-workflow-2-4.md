- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization of Search Space

- Description:
    1. The `vertex_nas_cli.py` tool allows users to specify a `search_space_module` which points to a Python module defining the search space.
    2. When a search job is launched locally or on Google Cloud, the `vertex_nas_cli.py`  loads and deserializes this user-provided module using `importlib.import_module`.
    3. If a malicious user can control the `search_space_module` parameter, they can inject arbitrary Python code into the system. This code will be executed during the NAS job execution as the module is imported and its functions are called.

- Impact:
    *   **High/Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the NAS job. This could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access to cloud resources (Vertex AI environment), or denial of service. The impact is critical in cloud environments like Vertex AI where unauthorized access can have significant consequences.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None. The code directly imports and uses the user-provided module without any sanitization or security checks.

- Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate the `search_space_module` input to ensure it adheres to a strict whitelist of allowed modules or a safe subset of functionalities. Avoid directly importing and executing arbitrary user-supplied code.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Execute the NAS job and user-provided modules in a sandboxed or isolated environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control the `search_space_module` parameter when launching a NAS job. For example, in tutorial examples, this parameter is passed via command line. In a real-world scenario, this could be exploited if the application allows users to configure and launch NAS jobs and doesn't properly sanitize this input.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/vertex_nas_cli.py`
    2. **Function:** `search_in_local_parser`, `search_parser`, `train_parser` - these parsers all include `--search_space_module` flag.
    3. **Function:** `get_search_space(args)` in `/code/vertex_nas_cli.py`
    ```python
    def get_search_space(args):
        ...
        elif args.search_space_module:
            search_space_module = args.search_space_module
        ...
        search_space_file, search_space_mthod_name = search_space_module.rsplit(
            ".", 1)
        module = importlib.import_module(search_space_file) # Vulnerability Point
        method = getattr(module, search_space_mthod_name)
        return method()
    ```
    4. **Analysis:** The code uses `importlib.import_module(search_space_file)` to dynamically import a module specified by the user-controlled `search_space_module` argument. This allows arbitrary code execution if an attacker can provide a malicious module path.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker creates a malicious Python module (e.g., `malicious_search_space.py`) with the following content:**
    ```python
    import pyglove as pg
    import os

    def malicious_search_space():
        os.system("touch /tmp/pwned") # Malicious command execution
        return pg.one_of([1, 2])
    ```
    2. **Attacker places this file in a location where it can be accessed by the NAS client (e.g., in the same directory or a publicly accessible location).**
    3. **Attacker crafts a command to run a local NAS search, specifying the malicious module as the `search_space_module`:**
    ```sh
    python3 vertex_nas_cli.py search_in_local --project_id=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --trainer_docker_id=<DOCKER_ID> --region=<REGION> --search_space_module=malicious_search_space --local_output_dir=/tmp/nas_tutorial --search_docker_flags search_space='malicious_search_space'
    ```
    4. **Execute the command.**
    5. **Verification:** After running the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, it confirms that the malicious code from `malicious_search_space.py` was executed, proving the arbitrary code execution vulnerability. In a real Vertex AI environment, the attacker could perform actions within the project's scope.
