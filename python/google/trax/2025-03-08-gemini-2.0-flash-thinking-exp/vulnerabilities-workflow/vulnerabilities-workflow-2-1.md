- Vulnerability name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Model File

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious model file (e.g., a pickled Python object) that contains code designed to execute harmful commands on the victim's system.
  2. The attacker makes this malicious model file accessible to users, for example, by hosting it on a public website or sharing it through email or messaging platforms.
  3. A user, intending to use a pre-trained Trax model, is tricked or unknowingly downloads and attempts to load the malicious model file using the `model.init_from_file` function in Trax.
  4. During the model loading process, the `pickle.load` function deserializes the malicious model file.
  5. Because the model file is crafted by an attacker, the deserialization process executes arbitrary code embedded within the malicious file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.

- Impact:
  Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:
    - Data theft and corruption: The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the user's system or modify/delete critical files.
    - System compromise: The attacker could install malware, create new user accounts, or take complete control of the user's system.
    - Privacy violation: The attacker could monitor user activity, access personal information, or use the compromised system to launch further attacks.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  None. Based on the provided files, there are no explicit security measures in place to prevent the loading of malicious model files. The README.md even encourages users to load models using `model.init_from_file` without mentioning any security considerations. The PROJECT FILES provided in this update do not indicate any implemented mitigations for this vulnerability.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement checks to validate the model file before loading, ensuring it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious code. This could include:
        - File type validation: Verify that the file is indeed a Trax model file (e.g., by checking file headers or magic numbers).
        - Integrity checks: Use cryptographic signatures or checksums to ensure the model file has not been tampered with.
        - Sandboxing/Isolation: Load the model file in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution.
    - Secure deserialization: Replace `pickle.load` with a safer deserialization method that prevents arbitrary code execution, or sanitize the loaded data to remove potentially malicious elements.
    - User education: Warn users about the risks of loading model files from untrusted sources and advise them to only load models from reliable and verified origins.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must download or otherwise obtain a malicious model file provided by the attacker.
    2. The user must execute Python code that uses Trax's `model.init_from_file` function to load the malicious model file.

- Source code analysis:
  ```python
  # Example code snippet from README.md (not actual source code of Trax library)
  model.init_from_file('gs://trax-ml/models/translation/ende_wmt32k.pkl.gz',
                       weights_only=True)
  ```
  This code snippet demonstrates the usage of `model.init_from_file`.  Assuming this function uses `pickle.load` (or similar insecure deserialization) internally to load the `.pkl.gz` file, it becomes vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.
  When `model.init_from_file` is called with a path to a malicious pickle file, the `pickle.load` function will deserialize the file's contents. If the attacker has embedded malicious Python code within the pickle file, `pickle.load` will execute that code during the deserialization process. This happens because pickle is not designed to be secure against malicious or untrusted data.

- Security test case:
  1. Create a malicious pickle file (`malicious_model.pkl`) using Python's `pickle` library. This file should contain code that executes a simple command, such as printing a message or creating a file.
  ```python
  import pickle
  import os

  class MaliciousObject:
      def __reduce__(self):
          return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

   злонамеренный_объект = MaliciousObject()
  pickle.dump(злонамеренный_объект, open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb'))
  ```
  2. Create a Python script (`test_exploit.py`) that uses Trax to load the malicious model file.
  ```python
  import trax
  from trax import models

  try:
      model = trax.models.Transformer() # or any other Trax model
      model.init_from_file('malicious_model.pkl')
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Exception during model loading: {e}")

  print("Loading attempted.")
  ```
  3. Run the `test_exploit.py` script.
  ```bash
  python test_exploit.py
  ```
  4. Check if the command embedded in the malicious pickle file was executed. In this case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created.
  ```bash
  ls -l /tmp/pwned
  ```
  If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved by loading the malicious model file, thus demonstrating the vulnerability. If an exception is raised during model loading, analyse the exception to confirm it's not preventing the code execution.
