- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution in `predict_drop.py`
- Description: The `predict_drop.py` script uses the `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result` function to evaluate arithmetic expressions provided in the model's output. An attacker could craft a question that, when processed by the model and `compute_result`, executes arbitrary Python code.
- Impact: Critical. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server running the `predict_drop.py` script, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Replace `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result` with a safe and sandboxed arithmetic expression evaluator.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious code injection into the question.
- Preconditions:
    - A Trax model trained for the DROP task must be deployed and accessible to attackers.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send questions to the deployed model that are processed by `predict_drop.py`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: /code/trax/predict_drop.py
    - Step 1: The `main` function processes questions from the DROP dataset and prepares them for inference.
    - Step 2: The code extracts numbers from the question using regex and stores them in `list_num`.
    - Step 3: The code calls `trax.supervised.decoding.autoregressive_sample` to generate an answer, which is expected to be an arithmetic expression.
    - Step 4: The code splits the generated answer into operations `list_op = answer.split('|')`.
    - Step 5: The code calls `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result(list_op, list_num)` to evaluate the arithmetic expression.
    - Step 6: `compute_result` (defined in `trax/data/tf_inputs.py`) uses `eval()` to execute the operations in `list_op`, which can contain arbitrary Python code injected by the attacker.
    ```python
    # Vulnerable code snippet from trax/predict_drop.py
    for i in range(len(answer_beams)):
        ...
        answer = trax.data.detokenize(...)
        ...
        list_op = answer.split('|')
        ...
        try:
          result = trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result(list_op, list_num) # Vulnerable line
          ...
        except Exception as e:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
          print(e)
          try:
            result = trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result(list_op[:-1], list_num) # Vulnerable line
            ...
          except Exception as e:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
            print(e)
            print('Infered incorrect computation.')
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Prepare a malicious question designed to execute arbitrary code, for example: `"What is 1 + 1? infer full calculation: 1 + 1 malicious_code = __import__('os').system('touch /tmp/pwned')"`
    - Step 2: Submit this question to the publicly accessible instance of the Trax project running `predict_drop.py`.
    - Step 3: Check the server's filesystem for the creation of the `/tmp/pwned` file, indicating successful code execution.
    - Step 4: Alternatively, observe server logs for any unusual activity or errors resulting from the injected code.

- Vulnerability Name: Training Data Leakage via `AsKeras` Layer
- Description: The `AsKeras` layer in `trax/trax2keras.py` might unintentionally include training data when converting a Trax model to a Keras model. If the Trax layer's weights or state contain references to training data (e.g., through closures or bound variables), this data could be serialized and included in the saved Keras model. An attacker gaining access to the saved Keras model could potentially extract this training data.
- Impact: Medium. Leakage of training data could expose sensitive information, compromise model privacy, and potentially aid in reverse engineering the model or training process.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Review and refactor the `AsKeras` layer to ensure that it does not inadvertently capture or serialize training data.
    - Implement checks and sanitization procedures during model conversion to remove any training data or sensitive information.
    - Document the potential risk of training data leakage when using `AsKeras` and advise users on best practices for mitigating this risk.
- Preconditions:
    - A Trax model must be converted to a Keras model using the `AsKeras` layer.
    - The saved Keras model must be accessible to an attacker.
    - The Trax model or its training process must have inadvertently introduced training data into the model's weights or state.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: /code/trax/trax2keras.py
    - Step 1: The `AsKeras` class initializes a Keras layer by wrapping a Trax layer.
    - Step 2: The `build` method initializes Keras variables using Trax layer weights and state.
    - Step 3: If the Trax layer's weights or state contain references to training data due to closure or other mechanisms, these references could be inadvertently serialized along with the model when `keras_model.save()` is called.
    ```python
    # Potentially vulnerable code snippet from trax/trax2keras.py
    class AsKeras(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      ...
      def build(self, input_shape):
        with math_lib.use_backend(math_lib.Backend.TFNP):
          ...
          weights = self._trax_layer.weights # Weights might contain references to training data
          state = self._trax_layer.state     # State might contain references to training data
          ...
          self._weights = math_lib.nested_map(
              functools.partial(tf.Variable, trainable=True), weights) # Serializing weights
          self._state = math_lib.nested_map(
              functools.partial(tf.Variable, trainable=False), state) # Serializing state
          ...
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a Trax model and train it on a small, identifiable dataset. Ensure that the model's architecture or training process might lead to training data being captured in weights or state (e.g., by using custom layers or data-dependent initialization).
    - Step 2: Convert the trained Trax model to a Keras model using `AsKeras`.
    - Step 3: Save the Keras model to disk using `keras_model.save()`.
    - Step 4: Load the saved Keras model and examine its weights and variables.
    - Step 5: Analyze the loaded model's weights and variables to determine if any identifiable fragments or patterns from the training dataset are present, indicating data leakage.
