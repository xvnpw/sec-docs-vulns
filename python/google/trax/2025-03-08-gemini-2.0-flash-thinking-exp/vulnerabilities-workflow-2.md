## Combined Vulnerability List

### Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Model File Loading

- **Vulnerability name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Model File Loading
- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious model file (e.g., a pickled Python object) that contains code designed to execute harmful commands on the victim's system.
  2. The attacker makes this malicious model file accessible to users, for example, by hosting it on a public website or sharing it through email or messaging platforms, or via Man-in-the-Middle attack.
  3. A user, intending to use a pre-trained Trax model, is tricked or unknowingly downloads and attempts to load the malicious model file using the `model.init_from_file` function in Trax.
  4. During the model loading process, the `pickle.load` function deserializes the malicious model file.
  5. Because the model file is crafted by an attacker, the deserialization process executes arbitrary code embedded within the malicious file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
- **Impact:**
  Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine or in the environment where the Trax code is being executed. This can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:
    - Data theft and corruption: The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the user's system or modify/delete critical files.
    - System compromise: The attacker could install malware, create new user accounts, or take complete control of the user's system.
    - Privacy violation: The attacker could monitor user activity, access personal information, or use the compromised system to launch further attacks.
- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
  None. Based on the provided files, there are no explicit security measures in place to prevent the loading of malicious model files. The README.md even encourages users to load models using `model.init_from_file` without mentioning any security considerations. The PROJECT FILES provided in this update do not indicate any implemented mitigations for this vulnerability.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Implement checks to validate the model file before loading, ensuring it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious code. This could include:
        - File type validation: Verify that the file is indeed a Trax model file (e.g., by checking file headers or magic numbers).
        - Integrity checks: Use cryptographic signatures or checksums to ensure the model file has not been tampered with.
        - Sandboxing/Isolation: Load the model file in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution.
    - Secure deserialization: Replace `pickle.load` with a safer deserialization method that prevents arbitrary code execution, or sanitize the loaded data to remove potentially malicious elements.
    - User education: Warn users about the risks of loading model files from untrusted sources and advise them to only load models from reliable and verified origins.
    - Implement HTTPS for GCS URL: Ensure that `model.init_from_file` always uses HTTPS URLs to communicate with Google Cloud Storage, encrypting the network traffic and making it harder for attackers to intercept and modify the model file during transit.
    - Implement Integrity Checks: Integrate integrity checks into the model loading process. This could involve:
        - Checksum Verification: Provide checksums (e.g., SHA256) for pre-trained model files alongside the download URLs. Trax should then calculate the checksum of the downloaded file and compare it against the provided checksum before loading the model.
        - Digital Signatures: Sign the pre-trained model files with a digital signature. Trax should then verify this signature using a public key to ensure the file's authenticity and integrity.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must download or otherwise obtain a malicious model file provided by the attacker, or be subject to a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
    2. The user must execute Python code that uses Trax's `model.init_from_file` function to load the malicious model file.
- **Source code analysis:**
  ```python
  # Example code snippet from README.md (not actual source code of Trax library)
  model.init_from_file('gs://trax-ml/models/translation/ende_wmt32k.pkl.gz',
                       weights_only=True)
  ```
  This code snippet demonstrates the usage of `model.init_from_file`.  Assuming this function uses `pickle.load` (or similar insecure deserialization) internally to load the `.pkl.gz` file, it becomes vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.
  When `model.init_from_file` is called with a path to a malicious pickle file, the `pickle.load` function will deserialize the file's contents. If the attacker has embedded malicious Python code within the pickle file, `pickle.load` will execute that code during the deserialization process. This happens because pickle is not designed to be secure against malicious or untrusted data.
- **Security test case:**
  1. **Create a malicious pickle file (`malicious_model.pkl`)**:
     ```python
     import pickle
     import os

     class MaliciousObject:
         def __reduce__(self):
             return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

     malicious_object = MaliciousObject()
     pickle.dump(malicious_object, open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb'))
     ```
  2. **Create a Python script (`test_exploit.py`) to load the malicious model**:
     ```python
     import trax
     from trax import models

     try:
         model = trax.models.Transformer() # or any other Trax model
         model.init_from_file('malicious_model.pkl')
     except Exception as e:
         print(f"Exception during model loading: {e}")

     print("Loading attempted.")
     ```
  3. **Run the `test_exploit.py` script**:
     ```bash
     python test_exploit.py
     ```
  4. **Check for command execution**: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created:
     ```bash
     ls -l /tmp/pwned
     ```
     If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, arbitrary code execution is confirmed.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Pre-trained Model Loading

- **Vulnerability name:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Pre-trained Model Loading
- **Description:**
  1. A user intends to use a pre-trained Trax model and executes code that utilizes the `model.init_from_file` function to load model weights from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URL (e.g., `gs://trax-ml/models/translation/ende_wmt32k.pkl.gz`).
  2. An attacker, positioned in a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) scenario (e.g., on a compromised network or through DNS spoofing), intercepts the network traffic between the user's machine and Google Cloud Storage.
  3. The attacker replaces the legitimate model file being downloaded from the GCS URL with a malicious file they control. This malicious file could contain backdoors, malware, or adversarial weights designed to compromise the user's system or the model's intended functionality.
  4. Trax's `model.init_from_file` function, as currently used in the example, loads the model weights from the (attacker-modified) file without performing integrity checks such as verifying a digital signature or checksum.
  5. The user's Trax model is initialized with the attacker's malicious weights.
  6. When the user uses the model for deep learning tasks, the malicious weights can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior, including data exfiltration, compromised prediction accuracy for adversarial purposes, or arbitrary code execution if the model loading process itself is exploited.
- **Impact:**
  - Code Execution: If the attacker embeds malicious code within the model file and exploits a vulnerability in Trax's model loading functionality, they could achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
  - Data Poisoning: By replacing legitimate model weights with adversarial weights, the attacker can subtly or drastically alter the model's behavior, leading to incorrect or manipulated outputs in downstream deep learning tasks. This can have severe consequences in applications where model accuracy and reliability are critical.
  - Security Breach: A successful MITM attack and malicious model injection can be a stepping stone to further compromise the user's system or the larger infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches or loss of sensitive information.
- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
  There are no evident mitigations in the provided `README.md` or other configuration files to prevent MITM attacks during model loading. The code directly fetches and loads model files from GCS without any integrity or authenticity checks.
- **Missing mitigations:**
  - Implement HTTPS for GCS URL: Ensure that `model.init_from_file` always uses HTTPS URLs to communicate with Google Cloud Storage, encrypting the network traffic and making it harder for attackers to intercept and modify the model file during transit.
  - Implement Integrity Checks: Integrate integrity checks into the model loading process. This could involve:
    - Checksum Verification: Provide checksums (e.g., SHA256) for pre-trained model files alongside the download URLs. Trax should then calculate the checksum of the downloaded file and compare it against the provided checksum before loading the model.
    - Digital Signatures: Sign the pre-trained model files with a digital signature. Trax should then verify this signature using a public key to ensure the file's authenticity and integrity.
- **Preconditions:**
  - Network Vulnerability: The attacker must be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, which typically requires the attacker to be on the same network as the user or to compromise network infrastructure (e.g., DNS spoofing).
  - User Action: The user must execute Trax code that uses the `model.init_from_file` function with a GCS URL to load a pre-trained model.
- **Source code analysis:**
  - File: `/code/README.md`
    ```python
    model.init_from_file('gs://trax-ml/models/translation/ende_wmt32k.pkl.gz',
                         weights_only=True)
    ```
    - This code snippet directly uses the `init_from_file` method of a Trax model to load weights from a GCS URL (`gs://trax-ml/models/translation/ende_wmt32k.pkl.gz`).
    - The code does not include any explicit checks for the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file.
  - File: `/code/trax/predict_drop.py`
    ```python
    model_file = os.path.join(FLAGS.checkpoint_dir, 'model.pkl.gz')
    _check_exists(model_file)
    gin.parse_config_file(os.path.join(FLAGS.checkpoint_dir, 'config.gin'))
    vocab, model, initial_state = prepare_model(model_file, FLAGS.batch_size)
    ```
    ```python
    model.init_from_file(
        model_file, weights_only=True, input_signature=(shape11, shape11))
    ```
    - Similar to the `README.md` example, there are no visible security checks before loading the model file.
- **Security test case:**
  1. **Prerequisites**: Attacker and User environments with necessary tools.
  2. **Setup Attacker Environment for MITM**: Configure attacker's machine to intercept network traffic.
  3. **Modify DNS or Proxy to Redirect GCS requests**: Redirect requests to `trax-ml.storage.googleapis.com` to attacker's server.
  4. **User Executes Vulnerable Code**: User runs code from `README.md` initializing model from GCS URL.
  5. **Observe Vulnerability**: Attacker observes request, user observes malicious code execution.

### Arbitrary Code Execution in `predict_drop.py`

- **Vulnerability name:** Arbitrary Code Execution in `predict_drop.py`
- **Description:** The `predict_drop.py` script uses the `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result` function to evaluate arithmetic expressions provided in the model's output. An attacker could craft a question that, when processed by the model and `compute_result`, executes arbitrary Python code.
- **Impact:** Critical. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server running the `predict_drop.py` script, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Replace `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result` with a safe and sandboxed arithmetic expression evaluator.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious code injection into the question.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A Trax model trained for the DROP task must be deployed and accessible to attackers.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send questions to the deployed model that are processed by `predict_drop.py`.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/trax/predict_drop.py`
    ```python
    for i in range(len(answer_beams)):
        ...
        answer = trax.data.detokenize(...)
        ...
        list_op = answer.split('|')
        ...
        try:
          result = trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result(list_op, list_num) # Vulnerable line
          ...
        except Exception as e:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
          print(e)
          try:
            result = trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result(list_op[:-1], list_num) # Vulnerable line
            ...
          except Exception as e:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
            print(e)
            print('Infered incorrect computation.')
    ```
    - Step 1: `predict_drop.py` processes questions.
    - Step 2: Numbers are extracted from the question.
    - Step 3: Model generates an answer (arithmetic expression).
    - Step 4: Answer split into operations.
    - Step 5: `trax.data.tf_inputs.compute_result` evaluates expression using `eval()`.
- **Security test case:**
    - Step 1: Prepare a malicious question: `"What is 1 + 1? infer full calculation: 1 + 1 malicious_code = __import__('os').system('touch /tmp/pwned')"`
    - Step 2: Submit question to public instance of Trax running `predict_drop.py`.
    - Step 3: Check server filesystem for `/tmp/pwned` file.
