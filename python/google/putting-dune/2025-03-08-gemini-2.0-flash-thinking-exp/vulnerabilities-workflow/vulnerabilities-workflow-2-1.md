- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization leading to Potential Information Disclosure or Unexpected Behavior in Image Processing

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious `.tfrecords` file.
  2. This file contains a serialized `Trajectory` object, where the `image` field within `Observation` objects is maliciously crafted. This could include:
    - Images with invalid dimensions.
    - Images containing NaN, Inf, or extremely large/small pixel values.
    - Images with unexpected data types.
  3. The attacker provides this malicious `.tfrecords` file as input to `align_trajectories.py` or `train_rate_learner.py` via the `--source_path` argument.
  4. When the application reads and deserializes the `Trajectory` objects from the `.tfrecords` file using `putting_dune/io.py` and `putting_dune/microscope_utils.py`, the malicious `image` data is loaded into memory without proper validation of its content or structure.
  5. Subsequently, if these scripts process or display the `image` data (e.g., during alignment, rate learning, or visualization, potentially using `plotting_utils.py`), the application may exhibit unexpected behavior due to the malicious image data. This could include:
    - Errors during image processing (e.g., in OpenCV or TensorFlow functions).
    - Exceptions during plotting (e.g., in Matplotlib functions).
    - Display of corrupted or unexpected visualizations.
    - Exposure of internal error messages or application state due to improper error handling.
    - In extreme cases, although less likely given the context, exploitation of underlying libraries to cause further issues.
  6. This unexpected behavior or error messages could potentially disclose sensitive information about the application's internal workings or data processing logic to the attacker.

- Impact:
  - Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain insight into the application's internal state, error handling, or data processing logic by observing the application's behavior when processing malicious image data.
  - Unexpected Behavior: The application might exhibit unexpected behavior, leading to incorrect results in image alignment or rate learning pipelines, although this is less of a direct security impact than information disclosure in this context.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The provided code does not include explicit input validation for the `image` data within `Trajectory` objects during deserialization or subsequent processing. The deserialization process relies on protobuf and TensorFlow's TFRecordDataset, which do not inherently provide content-based validation against malicious payloads beyond basic format checks.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Validation: Implement robust input validation checks within `putting_dune/io.py`, `putting_dune/microscope_utils.py`, `align_trajectories.py`, and `train_rate_learner.py` to verify the integrity and safety of the `image` data. This should include:
    - Image dimension validation to ensure they match expected sizes.
    - Pixel value range validation to ensure they are within acceptable bounds (e.g., 0-1 or 0-255).
    - Data type validation to ensure the image data is of the expected type (e.g., float32, uint8).
    - Checks for NaN and Inf values within image data.
  - Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage invalid image data. Avoid displaying verbose error messages that could reveal sensitive information to an attacker. Log errors securely for debugging purposes without exposing them to external users.
  - Input Sanitization: Consider sanitizing or clipping pixel values to a safe range before further processing, especially if third-party libraries are used for image manipulation.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.tfrecords` file to the application. This is possible if the application processes user-provided `.tfrecords` files or if an attacker can somehow influence the input data source. Based on the project description, providing a malicious `.tfrecords` file as input via `--source_path` is a valid precondition.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **`putting_dune/io.py`**: This file contains `read_records` function which utilizes `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` to read `.tfrecords` and `microscope_utils.ProtoModel.from_proto_string` to deserialize protobuf messages. This part of code is responsible for reading and deserializing data, but lacks specific validation for the content of `Trajectory` and `Observation` objects, including the `image` field.
  2. **`putting_dune/microscope_utils.py`**: Defines `Trajectory`, `Observation` and other data classes using protobuf. While dataclasses provide type hints, they do not enforce runtime validation of data integrity or malicious content. The `image` field in `MicroscopeObservation` is defined as `Optional[np.ndarray] = None`, allowing arbitrary numpy arrays to be loaded without explicit size or value constraints during deserialization.
  3. **`putting_dune/pipeline/align_trajectories.py` and `putting_dune/pipeline/train_rate_learner.py`**: These scripts (only `align_trajectories.py` partially shown in PROJECT FILES) are entry points for processing `.tfrecords` files. They read trajectories and process observations, potentially including image data. If they directly use the `image` data from deserialized `Trajectory` objects without validation, they are vulnerable.
  4. **`putting_dune/plotting_utils.py`**: This file contains functions to plot microscope frames and generate videos, potentially using the `image` data from `MicroscopeObservation`. If `generate_video_from_simulator_events` or similar functions process and display images without proper handling of invalid image data, vulnerabilities can be triggered. For example, `axes[2].imshow(args['image'], cmap='gray')` in `generate_video_from_simulator_events` will directly display the image, which can lead to issues if `args['image']` contains malicious data.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Craft a malicious `.tfrecords` file:**
     - Create a Python script to generate a `.tfrecords` file.
     - In this script, create a `Trajectory` object with a malicious `Observation`.
     - Within the `Observation`, create a numpy array for the `image` field that contains malicious data:
       ```python
       import numpy as np
       from putting_dune import microscope_utils
       from putting_dune import io as pdio
       import tensorflow as tf
       import datetime as dt
       from putting_dune import geometry

       # Malicious image data: NaN values
       malicious_image = np.full((128, 128, 1), np.nan, dtype=np.float32)

       malicious_observation = microscope_utils.MicroscopeObservation(
           grid=microscope_utils.AtomicGridMicroscopeFrame(microscope_utils.AtomicGrid(np.zeros((0, 2)), np.array([]))),
           fov=microscope_utils.MicroscopeFieldOfView(geometry.Point((0.0, 0.0)), geometry.Point((1.0, 1.0))),
           controls=(),
           elapsed_time=dt.timedelta(seconds=0),
           image=malicious_image,
       )
       malicious_trajectory = microscope_utils.Trajectory(observations=[malicious_observation])

       pdio.write_records("malicious_trajectories.tfrecords", [malicious_trajectory])
       print("Malicious tfrecords file 'malicious_trajectories.tfrecords' created.")
       ```
  2. **Run `align_trajectories.py` with the malicious file:**
     ```sh
     python -m putting_dune.pipeline.align_trajectories \
       --source_path malicious_trajectories.tfrecords \
       --target_path aligned_trajectories.tfrecords \
       --aligner_path /path/to/trained_aligner  # Replace with a valid aligner path if needed, or a dummy path if only testing deserialization
       --alignment_iterations 1
     ```
     (Replace `/path/to/trained_aligner` with a valid aligner path if necessary for the script to run without errors unrelated to image processing. If the script fails before image processing due to missing aligner, a dummy path can be used to proceed with testing deserialization and basic pipeline execution to reach the image processing stage.)
  3. **Observe the application's behavior:**
     - Check for error messages, exceptions, or unexpected program termination.
     - Examine if the application produces any visual output (e.g., plots, videos) and if they are corrupted or contain unexpected artifacts.
     - Monitor system resources (CPU, memory) for unusual consumption that could indicate a DoS condition, although DoS is excluded from the vulnerability list, it can be an indicator of processing issues.
  4. **Expected Result:**
     - The application might crash or throw an exception during image processing or plotting due to NaN values in the image data.
     - Error messages related to image processing libraries (OpenCV, Matplotlib, TensorFlow) might be displayed.
     - The video generation might fail or produce corrupted output.
     - If error handling is weak, verbose error messages might be shown, potentially disclosing internal paths or library versions.

This test case demonstrates a potential vulnerability due to insecure deserialization and lack of input validation, leading to unexpected behavior and potential information disclosure when processing malicious image data from a `.tfrecords` file.
