### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Missing Input Validation for DSA Website URL

* Description:
    1. An attacker can access the web configuration interface of the Product DSAs application.
    2. In the configuration settings, the attacker locates the "DSA Website" field, which is used to specify the website for Dynamic Search Ads.
    3. The attacker inputs a malicious URL, such as `http://attacker-controlled-site.com`, or a URL containing special characters or scripts, into the "DSA Website" field.
    4. The application saves this malicious URL as part of the target configuration.
    5. When the application generates Dynamic Search Ads based on this configuration, it uses the attacker-supplied malicious URL as the target website for the ads.
    6. Users who click on these generated ads will be redirected to the attacker-controlled site or potentially exposed to malicious content, instead of the intended website.

* Impact:
    - **Malicious Redirects:** Users clicking on ads generated by the Product DSAs application could be redirected to attacker-controlled websites. This can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or damage to the victim's brand reputation if users associate the malicious redirects with the legitimate brand.
    - **Unintended Campaign Settings:** While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code, missing validation in other configuration fields could lead to unintended or malicious campaign settings, such as incorrect bidding strategies, targeting, or ad schedules, wasting the victim's ad spend and potentially harming their Google Ads account performance.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None observed in the provided project files. There is no explicit input validation for the `dsa_website` field in the configuration validation functions (`ConfigTarget.validate` or `Config.validate` in `/code/common/config_utils.py`).

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation for DSA Website URL:** Implement robust input validation for the "DSA Website" field in the web configuration interface. This should include:
        - **Format validation:** Ensure the input is a valid URL format (e.g., using regular expressions or URL parsing libraries).
        - **Protocol validation:** Restrict allowed protocols to `http://` and `https://` and disallow protocols like `javascript:`, `data:`, or `file:`.
        - **Domain validation (optional but recommended):** Implement checks to ensure the domain is associated with the legitimate business and prevent the use of suspicious or blacklisted domains.
        - **Sanitization:** Sanitize the input to remove or encode any potentially malicious characters or scripts before storing and using it.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs access to the web configuration interface of a deployed instance of the Product DSAs application. This access is protected by Google Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), so the attacker would need to be granted "IAP-secured Web App User" role or exploit a vulnerability to bypass IAP.
    - The victim must have configured and be using the Product DSAs application to generate Dynamic Search Ads.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Configuration Loading:** The configuration, including the `dsa_website`, is loaded from `config.json` (or GCS if configured) using `config_utils.get_config` in `/code/common/config_utils.py` and used throughout the application.
    2. **`ConfigTarget` Class:** The `ConfigTarget` class in `/code/common/config_utils.py` defines the `dsa_website` attribute, but the `validate` method in `ConfigTarget` (and `Config`) does not include any specific validation rules for the `dsa_website` URL format or content.

    ```python
    # File: /code/common/config_utils.py
    class ConfigTarget(ConfigItemBase):
        # ...
        dsa_website: str = ''
        # ...
        def validate(self, generation=False) -> List:
            errors = []
            if not self.name or re.match('[^A-Za-z0-9_\-]', self.name):
                errors.append({
                    'field':
                        'name',
                    'error':
                        'Target name should not contain spaces (only symbols A-Za-z,0-9,_,-)'
                })
            if generation:
                if not self.page_feed_spreadsheetid:
                    errors.append({
                        'field': 'page_feed_spreadsheetid',
                        'error': 'No spreadsheet id for page feed found in configuration'
                    })
                if not self.dsa_website: # <--- Check for emptiness, but no format/content validation
                    errors.append({
                        'field': 'dsa_website',
                        'error': 'No DSA website found in configuration'
                    })
                # ...
            return errors
    ```
    3. **Campaign Generation (`/code/campaign_mgr.py`):** The `GoogleAdsEditorMgr` class in `/code/campaign_mgr.py` retrieves the `dsa_website` from the `context.target` and directly includes it in the campaign data for Google Ads Editor CSV generation without any further validation or sanitization.

    ```python
    # File: /code/campaign_mgr.py
    class GoogleAdsEditorMgr:
        # ...
        def add_campaign(self, name):
            campaign = self.__create_row()
            campaign_details = {
                CAMP_NAME: name,
                DSA_WEBSITE: self._context.target.dsa_website, # <--- dsa_website from config is used directly
                DSA_LANG: self._context.target.dsa_lang or '',
                DSA_TARGETING_SOURCE: 'Page feed',
                DSA_PAGE_FEEDS: self._context.target.page_feed_name
            }
            campaign.update(campaign_details)
            self._rows.append(campaign)
        # ...
    ```
    4. **No Sanitization or Validation before API Call:** There is no code in the provided files that sanitizes or validates the `dsa_website` before it is used in the generated CSV for Google Ads Editor. This CSV is intended to be uploaded to Google Ads Editor, which then uses this information to create Dynamic Search Ads in the victim's Google Ads account.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the Product DSAs application to Google Cloud Platform using the provided installation scripts.
        - Ensure IAP is enabled for the application and you have "IAP-secured Web App User" access.
        - Access the application through the provided App Engine URL.
        - Log in using your authorized Google account.
        - Navigate to the configuration settings of the application (assuming a web UI exists - not explicitly shown in files, but implied by "web configuration interface").
    2. **Steps:**
        - Locate the "DSA Website" configuration field in the web interface.
        - Enter the following malicious URL into the "DSA Website" field: `javascript:alert('XSS')`
        - Save the configuration changes.
        - Trigger the campaign generation process within the Product DSAs application (e.g., by running the wizard or API call).
        - Download the generated campaign CSV zip file.
        - Open the generated campaign CSV file (e.g., `gae-campaigns.csv`) and examine the "DSA Website" column.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The "DSA Website" column in the CSV file should contain the malicious URL `javascript:alert('XSS')` exactly as it was entered, indicating that the input was not validated or sanitized.
        - **(Further Manual Test in Google Ads Editor - Not Automatable with Files Only):**  Attempt to upload this CSV file into Google Ads Editor and publish the campaigns to a Google Ads account. If successful, ads may be created with the malicious `javascript:` URL. Clicking these ads (if Google Ads allows such URLs, which is unlikely for `javascript:` but possible with other malicious URLs or redirects) could trigger unexpected behavior or redirect users to unintended sites. A more realistic test would involve using a URL that redirects to an attacker's site, e.g., using a service like `tinyurl.com` to create a redirect to `http://attacker-controlled-site.com`. Then, use the `tinyurl.com` link as the DSA Website and check if clicks redirect to the attacker's site.
