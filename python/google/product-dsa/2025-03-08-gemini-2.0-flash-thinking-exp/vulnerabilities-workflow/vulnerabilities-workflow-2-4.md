- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Data Display

- Description:
  1. A threat actor with access to Google Merchant Center (GMC) modifies product data, specifically the title or description fields, to include malicious JavaScript code.
  2. The Product DSA application fetches this product data from GMC using BigQuery Data Transfer.
  3. A user accesses the Product DSA application through a web browser.
  4. The application displays the product data, including the title and description, without proper sanitization or encoding.
  5. The malicious JavaScript code embedded in the product title or description is executed in the user's browser, within the context of the application's web page.

- Impact:
  Successful XSS exploitation can lead to:
    - Account takeover: The attacker could steal session cookies or other authentication tokens, gaining unauthorized access to the user's Product DSA application and potentially linked Google accounts (Google Ads, GMC).
    - Data theft: Sensitive information displayed within the Product DSA application could be exfiltrated to a malicious server.
    - Malicious actions: The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user within the Product DSA application, such as modifying campaign settings or generating malicious reports.
    - Redirection to malicious sites: Users could be redirected to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None apparent from the provided project files. There is no code in `server/server.py`, `app/main.py`, or other backend files that suggests sanitization of product data before display.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization on the backend to process data fetched from Google Merchant Center. Specifically, HTML entities in product titles and descriptions should be encoded before rendering them in the application's UI.
  - Context-aware output encoding: Apply context-aware output encoding when displaying product data in the web application. Use appropriate encoding functions provided by the frontend framework to prevent interpretation of malicious scripts by the browser.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

- Preconditions:
  - Access to a Google Merchant Center account associated with the Product DSA application.
  - The ability to modify product data within the GMC account, specifically the title or description fields.
  - A user accessing the Product DSA application through a web browser and viewing product data that includes the attacker's malicious payload.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **Data Fetching:** The `app/data_gateway.py` module is responsible for fetching product data from BigQuery, which in turn is populated by the Google Merchant Center Data Transfer Service. The `load_products` function executes SQL queries (`get-products.sql`) to retrieve product information.
  2. **Data Processing:** The `app/campaign_mgr.py` module processes the fetched product data to generate campaign data for Google Ads Editor.  Functions like `__get_ad_description` in `GoogleAdsEditorMgr` and `AdCustomizerGenerator` extract and use product attributes like `title` and `description`.
  3. **Potential XSS Location:** The vulnerability likely exists in the frontend code (not provided), where the product data fetched and processed by the backend is displayed to the user.  The backend code in `server/server.py` serves API endpoints that provide product data in JSON format (e.g., `/api/products`). This data includes fields like `title` and `description` that originate from GMC. If the frontend directly renders these fields in HTML without sanitization, XSS is possible.

  # Visualization of data flow and potential XSS:

  Google Merchant Center (GMC) --> [Malicious Data Injection] --> GMC Feed Data
                                      |
                                      V
  BigQuery Data Transfer Service --> BigQuery Dataset (Products Data)
                                      |
                                      V  (app/data_gateway.py - load_products)
  Product DSA Backend Application --> Product Data (incl. malicious title/description)
                                      |
                                      V  (server/server.py - API endpoints like /api/products)
  Product DSA API Response (JSON) --> { "title": "<script>...", "description": "..." }
                                      |
                                      V  (Frontend Application - Rendering Data in UI - Susceptible to XSS)
  User Browser  <-- [XSS Payload Execution] <-- Product DSA Web Page
  ```

  4. **Lack of Sanitization:**  Reviewing the provided backend code, there is no evidence of any sanitization or output encoding applied to the product data before it is served via the API. The code focuses on data retrieval, processing for ad generation, but lacks security measures to prevent XSS.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
      - Access to a Google Merchant Center account linked to a Product DSA instance.
      - Access to a user account for the deployed Product DSA application.
  2. **Steps:**
      - Log in to the Google Merchant Center account.
      - Navigate to "Products" and select a product to edit or create a new product.
      - In the product's "Title" field, enter the following XSS payload: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!');</script>`. Alternatively, use the "Description" field.
      - Save the changes to the product in Google Merchant Center.
      - Wait for the next scheduled BigQuery Data Transfer to synchronize the GMC data with BigQuery (or manually trigger a data transfer if possible through the application's interface or GCP console).
      - Access the Product DSA application through a web browser and log in as a user.
      - Navigate to the section of the application where product data (including the modified product) is displayed (e.g., product list, product details page).
  3. **Expected Result:**
      - If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected!" should pop up in the browser window when the product data containing the malicious script is rendered.
  4. **Success/Failure:**
      - Success: The alert box appears, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
      - Failure: No alert box appears, indicating potential sanitization or encoding, or the vulnerability is not present in the tested location. Further investigation might be needed to check other data display locations.

This test case demonstrates a basic XSS vulnerability. More sophisticated payloads can be used to test for different attack vectors and bypass potential weak sanitization attempts.
