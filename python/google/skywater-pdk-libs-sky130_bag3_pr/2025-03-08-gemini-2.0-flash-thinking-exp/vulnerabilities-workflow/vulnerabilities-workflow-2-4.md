### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardware Trojan Injection via Primitive Modification
- Description:
    - An attacker with write access to the repository or the distribution package can modify the Python files defining the design primitives located in `/code/src/BAG_prim/schematic/`.
    - By altering the code in these files (e.g., `nmos4_standard.py`, `res_standard.py`, `mim_standard.py`), the attacker can introduce malicious functionalities (hardware Trojans) into the generated circuit layouts.
    - When a user utilizes this compromised library to generate analog circuits, the injected Trojan will be incorporated into the final chip design.
    - The Trojan can be designed to activate under specific conditions (e.g., after a certain time, under specific voltage or temperature, or triggered by a specific input pattern) and perform malicious actions, such as leaking sensitive information, causing system malfunction, or degrading performance.
- Impact:
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to severe consequences. Hardware Trojans can compromise the integrity and security of chips designed using this library.
    - Chips containing Trojans could malfunction in the field, leading to financial losses and reputational damage for the chip manufacturer and the end users of devices incorporating these chips.
    - In high-security applications (military, aerospace, critical infrastructure), a hardware Trojan could have catastrophic consequences, including data breaches, system failures, and safety risks.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project does not implement any specific mitigations against supply chain manipulation or hardware Trojan injection. The code is provided without integrity checks or security mechanisms to prevent or detect malicious modifications.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Code Signing and Verification:** Implement a code signing process for the primitive definition files. This would involve cryptographically signing the legitimate versions of the Python files. Users of the library could then verify the signatures to ensure the integrity of the code before using it.
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks within the BAG framework to verify that the primitive definition files have not been tampered with at runtime. This could involve checksumming or hashing the files and comparing them against known good values.
    - **Access Control:** Restrict write access to the repository and distribution packages to only authorized personnel. Implement strict access control policies and audit logs to monitor and control who can modify the codebase.
    - **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase, focusing on identifying potential vulnerabilities and backdoors. This should include both automated and manual code reviews.
    - **Supply Chain Security Awareness:** Educate developers and users about the risks of supply chain manipulation and hardware Trojans. Promote secure development practices and encourage users to obtain the library from trusted sources and verify its integrity.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs write access to the project's repository or the distribution mechanism used to deliver the library to users. This could be achieved through compromised developer accounts, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in the repository's security.
    - Users must be using the library to generate analog integrated circuit designs.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability stems from the project's architecture, where primitive definitions are directly implemented in modifiable Python source code files.
    - Files like `/code/src/BAG_prim/schematic/nmos4_standard.py`:
        ```python
        from bag.design.module import MosModuleBase
        from bag.design.database import ModuleDB
        from bag.util.immutable import Param

        class BAG_prim__nmos4_standard(MosModuleBase):
            """design module for BAG_prim__nmos4_standard.
            """

            def __init__(self, database: ModuleDB, params: Param, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
                MosModuleBase.__init__(self, '', database, params, **kwargs)
        ```
        - This file defines the `BAG_prim__nmos4_standard` primitive. An attacker can modify the `__init__` method or add new methods to introduce malicious behavior.
        - For example, an attacker could add code to modify the device parameters based on certain conditions, introduce extra parasitic components, or create unexpected connections in the generated layout.
    - Similar Python files exist for other primitives (resistors, capacitors, etc.) in the same directory, all of which are susceptible to modification.
    - The `install.sh` script automates the setup process, but it does not include any security checks to verify the integrity of the files being installed.
    - The configuration files (`tech_config.yaml`, `corners_setup.yaml`, `netlist_setup/*.yaml`) are also plain text files that could be modified, although the Python primitive definitions are the most direct and impactful target for Trojan injection.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Environment:** As an attacker, clone the repository to a local machine.
    2. **Modify Primitive Definition:** Edit the file `/code/src/BAG_prim/schematic/nmos4_standard.py`. Add malicious code within the `__init__` method. For example, add a line to print a message or, more realistically, introduce a subtle change in device parameters that would act as a hardware Trojan.
        ```python
        from bag.design.module import MosModuleBase
        from bag.design.database import ModuleDB
        from bag.util.immutable import Param
        import logging

        class BAG_prim__nmos4_standard(MosModuleBase):
            """design module for BAG_prim__nmos4_standard.
            """

            def __init__(self, database: ModuleDB, params: Param, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
                logging.warning("Trojan Activated: nmos4_standard primitive is compromised!") # Trojan logging
                # Malicious code to alter device parameters or introduce Trojan behavior can be added here.
                MosModuleBase.__init__(self, '', database, params, **kwargs)
        ```
    3. **Install the Modified Library:** Run the `install.sh` script to set up the modified library in a simulated user environment.
    4. **Generate a Test Circuit:** Create a simple BAG-based design (using BAG3 framework as described in README) that utilizes the `nmos4_standard` primitive. Generate the layout for this test circuit using the BAG framework.
    5. **Verify Trojan Activation:**
        - **For the simple print message Trojan:** Check the BAG framework's output logs or console output during layout generation. The "Trojan Activated" message should be present, indicating that the modified primitive definition was executed.
        - **For a more realistic Trojan (parameter modification):** Simulate the generated layout. Compare the simulation results with those from a layout generated using the original, uncompromised library. If the Trojan is effective, there should be discrepancies in the simulation results, indicating that the circuit behavior has been altered as intended by the attacker.
    6. **(Optional) Hardware Verification:**  For full validation in a real-world scenario, fabricate a test chip based on the Trojan-injected layout.  Test the fabricated chip to confirm the Trojan's activation and malicious behavior in hardware.

This test case demonstrates how easily an attacker can modify the primitive definitions and inject a basic Trojan. More sophisticated Trojans can be implemented to be stealthier and harder to detect, having more significant and damaging impacts.
