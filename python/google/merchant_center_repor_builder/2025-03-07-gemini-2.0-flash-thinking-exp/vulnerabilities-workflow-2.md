## Vulnerability List

### Potential Insecure Direct Object Reference in `/product-disapprovals` endpoint
- Description:
    1. The `/product-disapprovals` endpoint in `webapi/app.py` is intended to provide product disapproval reports.
    2. Currently, the endpoint returns hardcoded data, but a comment in the code (`# todo: de-hardcode it when payload contains unique merchant id`) indicates future functionality will involve fetching data based on a merchant identifier, potentially a `client_id`.
    3. If the `client_id` is derived from user input (e.g., URL parameters, session cookies) without proper authorization checks, an attacker could manipulate this identifier.
    4. By altering the `client_id` in their requests, an attacker could potentially bypass intended access controls and retrieve product disapproval reports belonging to different merchants, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to product disapproval reports of other merchants. This could expose sensitive business information, product details, and disapproval reasons, potentially leading to competitive disadvantage or reputational damage for affected merchants.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The current implementation returns hardcoded data, which, while not functional for the intended purpose, prevents exposure of real merchant data in this specific version. However, there are no security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access if the endpoint is modified to fetch dynamic data based on a merchant identifier.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Authentication:** Implement an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the user making the request. This could involve using API keys, OAuth 2.0, or similar methods to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint.
    - **Authorization:** Implement an authorization mechanism to check if the authenticated user is authorized to access the requested merchant's data. This should verify that the user has the necessary permissions for the merchant ID they are trying to access.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If the `client_id` or merchant identifier is derived from user input, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. While IDOR is the primary concern, preventing other input-based attacks is a general security best practice.
- Preconditions:
    - The `/product-disapprovals` endpoint needs to be modified to dynamically fetch product disapproval data based on a merchant identifier (e.g., `client_id`).
    - The merchant identifier must be derived from user-controlled input or session parameters without proper authorization checks.
    - The application must be deployed and accessible to external users.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/webapi/app.py`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      @app.route('/product-disapprovals')
      @cross_origin()
      def productDisapprovals():
          # todo: de-hardcode it when payload contains unique merchant id
          client_id = 'ABC.123'
          track(client_id)
          return product_disapprovals
      ```
    - **Analysis:**
        1. Currently, the `client_id` is hardcoded as `'ABC.123'`.
        2. The `productDisapprovals()` function directly returns the `product_disapprovals` list, which is also hardcoded within the same file.
        3. The comment `# todo: de-hardcode it when payload contains unique merchant id` clearly indicates that the intention is to replace the hardcoded `client_id` and `product_disapprovals` with dynamic data retrieval based on a unique merchant identifier.
        4. **Vulnerable Scenario:** If the `client_id` is changed to be obtained from the request, for example, using `request.args.get('merchantId')`, and the `product_disapprovals` data is fetched from a database or external API based on this `client_id` *without implementing authorization checks*, then an attacker can exploit this.
        5. **Exploit Flow:**
            - Attacker sends a request to `/product-disapprovals?merchantId=merchant123`.
            - The application retrieves `merchantId` 'merchant123' from the request.
            - The application queries the database or API for product disapprovals associated with `merchantId` 'merchant123'.
            - The application returns the data to the attacker *without verifying if the attacker is authorized to access data for 'merchant123'*.
            - Attacker can then repeat this process with different `merchantId` values to access data of other merchants.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy the application as is (with hardcoded data).
    2. **Access Endpoint:** As an external attacker, access the `/product-disapprovals` endpoint using a web browser or `curl`. For example: `https://<deployed-application-url>/product-disapprovals`
    3. **Observe Response:** Observe that the response contains the hardcoded `product_disapprovals` data.
    4. **(Simulate Vulnerable Code - Code Modification Needed for Full Test):**
        - **Modify `/code/webapi/app.py` to simulate the vulnerable scenario:**
          ```python
          # ... imports ...
          # Assume product_disapprovals are now fetched from a function based on merchant_id
          def get_product_disapprovals_for_merchant(merchant_id):
              # In a real scenario, this would fetch data from a database or API
              # For simulation, let's use a dictionary to represent merchant-specific data
              merchant_data = {
                  'merchant1': [ {"name": "Disapproval 1 for merchant1", "code": "D1-M1"} ],
                  'merchant2': [ {"name": "Disapproval 1 for merchant2", "code": "D1-M2"} ],
                  'ABC.123': product_disapprovals # Keep original hardcoded data for default
              }
              return merchant_data.get(merchant_id, [])

          @app.route('/product-disapprovals')
          @cross_origin()
          def productDisapprovals():
              merchant_id = request.args.get('merchantId') # Get merchantId from request
              if not merchant_id:
                  merchant_id = 'ABC.123' # Default if not provided
              track(merchant_id)
              disapprovals = get_product_disapprovals_for_merchant(merchant_id) # Fetch dynamic data
              return disapprovals
          ```
        - **Redeploy the modified application.**
    5. **Exploit Test (After Code Modification):**
        - **Request Merchant 1 Data:** Access `/product-disapprovals?merchantId=merchant1`. Observe the response contains `[ {"name": "Disapproval 1 for merchant1", "code": "D1-M1"} ]`.
        - **Request Merchant 2 Data:** Access `/product-disapprovals?merchantId=merchant2`. Observe the response contains `[ {"name": "Disapproval 1 for merchant2", "code": "D1-M2"} ]`.
    6. **Verification:** If you can successfully retrieve different product disapproval reports by simply changing the `merchantId` parameter in the URL without any authentication or authorization, then the Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability is confirmed.
