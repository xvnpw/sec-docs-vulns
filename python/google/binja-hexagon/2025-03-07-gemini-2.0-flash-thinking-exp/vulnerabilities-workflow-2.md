### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via Crafted Instruction Semantics in `gen_insn_text_funcs.py`
* Description:
    1. The `gen_insn_text_funcs.py` script parses instruction semantics definitions to generate code for tokenizing instructions in Binary Ninja.
    2. The script uses the Lark parser with a grammar defined in `insn_grammar`.
    3. An attacker can potentially craft a malicious instruction semantics definition (e.g., by submitting a pull request to modify files in `third_party/qemu-hexagon/`) that, when parsed by `gen_insn_text_funcs.py`, leads to the generation of malicious Python code.
    4. This malicious code is then incorporated into the `tokenize_*.py` functions, which are part of the Binary Ninja plugin.
    5. When a security researcher analyzes a Hexagon binary, and the plugin uses the generated tokenizer for a crafted instruction, the malicious Python code gets executed within the researcher's Binary Ninja environment.
    6. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the researcher's machine when they analyze a specially crafted Hexagon binary.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the security researcher's Binary Ninja environment.
    - Full compromise of the researcher's workstation is possible, including data exfiltration, installation of malware, and further attacks on the researcher's network.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project relies on code review via GitHub pull requests as mentioned in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This is intended to catch malicious or erroneous code before it's merged.
    - Type checking is used in `plugin/type_util.py`, but this is for runtime type checks in Python and does not prevent code injection during code generation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for instruction semantics definitions to prevent injection of arbitrary code.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the code generation process to limit the impact of a successful injection.
    - Automated security testing specifically targeting code injection vulnerabilities in the code generation scripts.
    - Principle of least privilege applied to the code generation scripts and the plugin execution environment.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the instruction semantics definitions used by the plugin. This could be achieved through a malicious pull request that is not properly reviewed.
    - A security researcher needs to analyze a malicious Hexagon binary using the vulnerable Binary Ninja plugin.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/plugin/gen_insn_text_funcs.py`
    - The script uses `lark-parser` to parse instruction behavior descriptors.
    - The `InsnTreeTransformer` class transforms the parsed tree into Python code strings that are then embedded into the generated tokenizer functions.
    - **Vulnerable Code Snippet (Hypothetical):** If the `InsnTreeTransformer` directly embeds string literals from the parsed behavior descriptor into the generated Python code without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable. For example, if the behavior descriptor contains something like `"; import os; os.system('malicious_command'); //"` and the `InsnTreeTransformer` generates code like `result.emplace_back(TextToken, "{behavior_descriptor_part}");`, then the malicious code could be injected.
    - **Visualization (Conceptual):**
        ```
        Instruction Semantics Definition (maliciously crafted) --> Lark Parser (parses definition) --> Parse Tree --> InsnTreeTransformer (transforms tree to Python code string - VULNERABILITY POINT: potential code injection if not sanitized) --> Generated Python Tokenizer Function (contains malicious code) --> Binary Ninja Plugin (executes tokenizer) --> Arbitrary Code Execution
        ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a Binary Ninja environment with the Hexagon plugin installed.
        - Obtain a vulnerable version of the `gen_insn_text_funcs.py` script (or modify it to simulate the vulnerability).
    2. **Craft Malicious Instruction Semantics Definition:**
        - Create a modified instruction definition file (e.g., `third_party/qemu-hexagon/imported/malicious.idef`) that includes a crafted semantics definition designed for code injection in `gen_insn_text_funcs.py`.
        - Example malicious semantics definition (within `.idef` file):
            ```
            SEMANTICS(
                "VULN_TEST",
                "vulnerable_instruction",
                \"\"\"{\\n  // Vulnerability test - code injection\\n  import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned'); //\\n  RdV=RsV+RtV;\\n}\"\"\"
            )
            ATTRIBUTES(
                "VULN_TEST",
                "ATTRIBS()"
            )
            ```
    3. **Regenerate Tokenizer Functions:**
        - Run the `plugin/gen_insn_text_funcs.py` script to regenerate the tokenizer functions, including the malicious code from the crafted semantics definition.
    4. **Compile and Install Plugin:**
        - Build and install the modified Binary Ninja plugin.
    5. **Craft Malicious Hexagon Binary:**
        - Create a simple Hexagon binary that includes an instance of the "VULN_TEST" instruction. This binary will be used to trigger the vulnerability in Binary Ninja.
    6. **Analyze Malicious Binary in Binary Ninja:**
        - Open the crafted Hexagon binary in Binary Ninja using the modified plugin.
    7. **Verify Code Execution:**
        - Check if the malicious code (`touch /tmp/pwned`) was executed on the system where Binary Ninja is running. The existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file would confirm successful code injection and execution.

* Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via Crafted Instruction Semantics in `gen_il_funcs.py`
* Description:
    1. The `gen_il_funcs.py` script parses instruction semantics definitions to generate code for lifting Hexagon instructions to Binary Ninja's Low-Level IL (LLIL).
    2. The script uses the Lark parser with a grammar defined in `semantics_grammar`.
    3. An attacker can potentially craft a malicious instruction semantics definition (e.g., by submitting a pull request to modify files in `third_party/qemu-hexagon/`) that, when parsed by `gen_il_funcs.py`, leads to the generation of malicious Python code.
    4. This malicious code is then incorporated into the `lift_*.py` functions, which are part of the Binary Ninja plugin.
    5. When a security researcher analyzes a Hexagon binary, and the plugin uses the generated lifter for a crafted instruction, the malicious Python code gets executed within the researcher's Binary Ninja environment.
    6. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the researcher's machine when they analyze a specially crafted Hexagon binary.
