- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in EBS Snapshot Copy to S3 Feature

- Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious EBS snapshot ID containing shell command injection payloads.
  - Step 2: A security investigator, intending to create a forensic copy of a compromised EBS snapshot, uses the `cloudforensics aws imageebssnapshottos3` command and provides the attacker-crafted snapshot ID as input using the `--snapshot_id` parameter.
  - Step 3: The `ImageEBSSnapshotToS3` function in `tools/aws_cli.py` calls `forensics.CopyEBSSnapshotToS3`, which in turn executes the script `libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`.
  - Step 4: The `ebsCopy` function in `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script directly uses the user-supplied `snapshot` variable (derived from `--snapshot_id`) in an `aws ec2 create-volume` command without proper sanitization.
  - Step 5: Due to lack of input sanitization, the attacker's injected shell commands within the snapshot ID are executed on the investigator's system when the `aws ec2 create-volume` command is run.

- Impact:
  - Arbitrary command execution on the security investigator's machine.
  - Potential for data exfiltration from the investigator's system, installation of malware, or further compromise of the investigation environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. Source code analysis and security test case below demonstrate the absence of input sanitization for the snapshot ID in the CLI tool and the backend script.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: Sanitize the `--snapshot_id` input in `tools/aws_cli.py` and ensure that any parameters passed to the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script are properly escaped or validated to prevent command injection. Specifically, when constructing the `aws ec2 create-volume` command within the `ebsCopy` shell function.
  - Principle of least privilege: The script `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` and functions calling it should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of command injection. However, this is a mitigation for impact, not for the vulnerability itself.

- Preconditions:
  - The investigator must use the `cloudforensics aws imageebssnapshottos3` CLI command.
  - The investigator must provide a malicious EBS snapshot ID crafted by the attacker.
  - The AWS CLI tools must be configured and accessible to the `cloudforensics` CLI tool execution environment.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/tools/aws_cli.py`
    ```python
    def ImageEBSSnapshotToS3(args: 'argparse.Namespace') -> None:
      """Image an EBS snapshot with the result placed into an S3 location.
      ...
      Args:
        args (argparse.Namespace): Arguments from ArgumentParser.
      """
      forensics.CopyEBSSnapshotToS3(
        instance_profile_name=args.instance_profile_name or 'ebsCopy',
        zone=args.zone,
        s3_destination=args.s3_destination,
        snapshot_id=args.snapshot_id, # User-supplied input
        subnet_id=args.subnet_id,
        security_group_id=args.security_group_id,
        cleanup_iam=args.cleanup_iam
      )
    ```
    - The `ImageEBSSnapshotToS3` function in `tools/aws_cli.py` takes `args.snapshot_id` as input directly from the user's command line.
    - This `args.snapshot_id` is passed unchecked to `forensics.CopyEBSSnapshotToS3`.

  - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/aws/forensics.py`
    ```python
    def CopyEBSSnapshotToS3(
        s3_destination,
        snapshot_id, # User-supplied input passed from aws_cli.py
        instance_profile_name,
        zone,
        subnet_id=None,
        security_group_id=None,
        cleanup_iam=True):

      ...
      # read in the instance userdata script, sub in the snap id and S3 dest
      startup_script = utils.ReadStartupScript(
        utils.EBS_SNAPSHOT_COPY_SCRIPT_AWS).format(snapshot_id, s3_destination) # User-supplied input is directly formatted into the script
      ...
    ```
    - The `CopyEBSSnapshotToS3` function receives the `snapshot_id` and formats it directly into `startup_script`.
    - The `startup_script` is then used as userdata for an EC2 instance.

  - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash -x

    set -o pipefail

    snapshot={0:s} # User-supplied input is assigned to shell variable 'snapshot'
    bucket={1:s}

    # This script gets used by python's string.format, so following curly braces need to be doubled

    function ebsCopy {{
      # params
      snapshot=$1 # Shell variable 'snapshot' is passed as argument to ebsCopy function
      bucket=$2

      echo snapshot: "$snapshot"
      echo bucket: "$bucket"

      # Install utilities
      amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
      yum install jq dc3dd -y

      # Get details about self
      region=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region)
      az=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
      instance=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)

      echo region: "$region"
      echo az: "$az"
      echo instance: "$instance"

      # create the new volume
      volume=$(aws ec2 --region $region create-volume --availability-zone $az --snapshot-id $snapshot --tag-specification 'ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{{Key=Name,Value=volumeToCopy}}]' | jq -r .VolumeId) # Shell variable 'snapshot' is directly used in 'aws ec2 create-volume' command
      ...
    }}

    ebsCopy $snapshot $bucket 2> /tmp/err > /tmp/out
    ...
    ```
    - The `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script takes the formatted `snapshot` variable from Python code and directly uses it in the shell command `aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id $snapshot`.
    - This direct usage without sanitization allows command injection.

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Precondition: Attacker has access to an AWS account and can create EBS snapshots. Investigator has `cloudforensics` CLI tool installed and configured with AWS credentials.
  - Step 2: Attacker creates a malicious EBS snapshot ID: `snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`;rm /tmp/foo;echo vulnerable> /tmp/foo` (Note: replace `snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with a valid, although not necessarily existing, snapshot id prefix to satisfy AWS CLI format requirements).
  - Step 3: Investigator executes the command: `cloudforensics aws <investigator_zone> imageebssnapshottos3 --snapshot_id='snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';rm /tmp/foo;echo vulnerable> /tmp/foo' --s3_destination='s3://<investigator_bucket>/test/'` (Replace `<investigator_zone>` and `<investigator_bucket>` with valid values).
  - Step 4: Observe the investigator's system.
  - Step 5: Expected outcome: A file named `foo` containing the word `vulnerable` should be created in the `/tmp` directory of the investigator's system, indicating successful command injection. The command `rm /tmp/foo` was also executed, but its effect is not directly observable in this test case.
