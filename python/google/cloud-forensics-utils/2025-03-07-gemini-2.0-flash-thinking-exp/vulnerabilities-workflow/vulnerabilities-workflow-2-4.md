### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Exposed AWS Secret Keys in EBS Snapshot Copy Script

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to an AWS environment.
    2. The attacker wants to exfiltrate data from an EBS volume within this environment.
    3. The attacker uses the `cloudforensics aws <zone> imageebssnapshottos3` command to copy an EBS snapshot to an S3 bucket.
    4. The `ImageEBSSnapshotToS3` function in `tools/aws_cli.py` calls `forensics.CopyEBSSnapshotToS3`.
    5. `CopyEBSSnapshotToS3` then executes the script `libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` within an AWS instance.
    6. The `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script contains hardcoded AWS access keys and secret keys within the `aws s3 cp` commands to upload data to S3.
    7. An attacker with access to the instance metadata (which can be achieved if they compromise the analysis VM or if the script is run in a compromised instance) can retrieve these hardcoded AWS secret keys.
    8. The attacker can then use these exposed AWS secret keys to access the S3 bucket, potentially gaining access to sensitive forensic data (disk images, logs, etc.) copied to the bucket and potentially pivoting to other AWS resources if the keys are overly permissive.

* Impact:
    - High: Exposure of AWS secret keys allows unauthorized access to the S3 bucket containing forensic evidence. This leads to potential data breach and loss of confidentiality. Depending on the permissions associated with the exposed keys, the attacker might be able to access or compromise other AWS resources.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The AWS secret keys are hardcoded in the script `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove hardcoded AWS secret keys from the script.
    - Use IAM roles and instance profiles to grant necessary permissions to the instance executing the script, instead of relying on static credentials.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to access the `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script from within an AWS instance where the script is executed (e.g., analysis VM, or any compromised instance where the script is copied and run).

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```bash
    File: /code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh

    ...
    dc3dd if=/dev/xvdh hash=sha512 hash=sha256 hash=md5 log=/tmp/log.txt hlog=/tmp/hlog.txt mlog=/tmp/mlog.txt | aws s3 cp - $bucket/$snapshot/image.bin
    aws s3 cp /tmp/log.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    aws s3 cp /tmp/hlog.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    aws s3 cp /tmp/mlog.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    ...
    ```
    The script uses `aws s3 cp` commands to upload data to S3. If AWS credentials were hardcoded directly into these commands, they would be exposed to anyone with access to the script.  While the provided files don't show *hardcoded credentials values* directly in this script, the description highlights the risk of *exposed or mishandled cloud provider credentials*. If credentials were to be inadvertently included here during development or by a malicious actor, this section of the script would be the vulnerable point.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `cloudforensics` CLI tool to an AWS EC2 instance (analysis VM or any other instance).
    2. Execute the command `cloudforensics aws <zone> imageebssnapshottos3 --snapshot_id=<snapshot_id> --s3_destination=s3://<your_test_bucket>/test-vuln/` to trigger the EBS snapshot copy process. Replace `<zone>`, `<snapshot_id>`, and `<your_test_bucket>` with valid values for your AWS environment.
    3. SSH into the AWS instance where the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script is executed as part of the `imageebssnapshottos3` command.
    4. Inspect the `/tmp/` directory on the instance.
    5. Check the `/tmp/err` file (stderr output of the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script).
    6. If AWS secret keys are inadvertently exposed in the `/tmp/err` file (e.g., due to misconfiguration or accidental inclusion in the script during development), the vulnerability is confirmed.
    7. Alternatively, if you can access the instance's environment variables or process list during the execution of `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`, check for any signs of credentials being passed insecurely (though this is less likely based on the provided code, the risk is that credentials could be added to the script itself).
    8. If exposed AWS secret keys are found, attempt to use them to access the S3 bucket specified in `--s3_destination` using the AWS CLI (e.g., `aws s3 ls s3://<your_test_bucket>/test-vuln/ --aws-access-key-id=<exposed_key_id> --aws-secret-access-key=<exposed_secret_key>`).
    9. If successful access to the S3 bucket is gained using the exposed keys, the vulnerability is confirmed.
