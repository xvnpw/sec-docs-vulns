### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in `collect` and `artefact` commands
- Description:
  - An attacker crafts a malicious file path or artefact name containing command injection payloads.
  - The attacker uses the `grrshell collect` or `grrshell artefact` command, providing the malicious path or artefact name as input via `--remote-path` or `--artefact` flags.
  - GRR Shell, without proper sanitization, passes this malicious input to the GRR server when initiating a `ClientFileFinder` or `ArtifactCollectorFlow`.
  - If the GRR server is vulnerable to command injection through file paths or artefact names, the attacker's payload is executed on the GRR server.
- Impact:
  - If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the GRR server.
  - This can potentially lead to:
    - Data exfiltration from the GRR server.
    - System compromise of the GRR server.
    - Further attacks on the GRR infrastructure and managed clients.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. No input sanitization is implemented in GRR Shell for `remote-path` or `artefact_name`.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization for `remote-path` and `artefact_name` in GRR Shell to prevent command injection payloads from being passed to the GRR server.
  - Input validation for `remote-path` and `artefact_name` to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker requires access to a GRR Shell instance.
  - The attacker needs valid GRR credentials to connect to a GRR server.
  - The GRR server must be vulnerable to command injection through file paths or artefact names (this is an assumption and needs to be verified).
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/grrshell/cli/main.py`
    - Function: `_RunCommand`
    - Step 1: The `_RunCommand` function is called to process commands like `collect` and `artefact`.
    - Step 2: For the `collect` command, the `remote-path` is directly retrieved from `flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value`.
    - Step 3: This `remote-path` value, taken directly from user input, is passed without sanitization to `self._client.CollectFiles(flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value, flags.FLAGS['local-path'].value)`.
    ```
    elif command == 'collect':
      if not flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value:
        print(_USAGE())
        return
      self._client.CollectFiles(flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value,
                                flags.FLAGS['local-path'].value)
    ```
    - Step 4: Similarly, for the `artefact` command, the `artefact_name` is directly retrieved from `flags.FLAGS['artefact'].value`.
    - Step 5: This `artefact_name` value, also from user input, is passed unsanitized to `self._client.ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact(flags.FLAGS['artefact'].value, flags.FLAGS['local-path'].value)`.
    ```
    elif command in ('artifact', 'artefact'):
      if not flags.FLAGS['artefact'].value:
        print(_USAGE())
        return
      self._client.ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact(
          flags.FLAGS['artefact'].value, flags.FLAGS['local-path'].value)
    ```
  - File: `/code/grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py`
    - Functions: `CollectFiles` and `ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact`
    - Step 1: In `CollectFiles`, the unsanitized `remote_path` is used to create `ClientFileFinderArgs`.
    - Step 2: The `ClientFileFinderArgs` including the unsanitized path is sent to the GRR server to initiate a `ClientFileFinder` flow.
    ```python
      def CollectFiles(self, remote_path: str, local_path: str) -> None:
        """Collects files from the remote client."""
        logger.debug('CollectFiles path: %s', remote_path)

        flow_args = self._stubby.ClientFileFinderArgs()
        flow_args.paths.append(remote_path) # Unsanitized remote_path
        ...
        self._StartClientSideOperation('ClientFileFinder', flow_args,
                                         flow_id_prefix='CFF')
    ```
    - Step 3: In `ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact`, the unsanitized `artefact_name` is used to create `ArtifactCollectorFlowArgs`.
    - Step 4: The `ArtifactCollectorFlowArgs` including the unsanitized artefact name is sent to the GRR server to initiate `ArtifactCollectorFlow`.
    ```python
    def ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact(self, artefact_name: str,
                                       local_path: str) -> None:
      """Schedules and downloads a GRR artefact."""
      logger.debug('ScheduleAndDownloadArtefact artefact: %s', artefact_name)

      flow_args = self._stubby.ArtifactCollectorFlowArgs()
      flow_args.artifact_list.append(artefact_name) # Unsanitized artefact_name
      flow_args.use_raw_filesystem_access = self._UseRawFSForClient()
      flow_args.max_file_size = self._max_file_size
      ...
      self._StartClientSideOperation('ArtifactCollectorFlow', flow_args,
                                       flow_id_prefix='ArtifactCollectorFlow')
    ```
- Security Test Case:
  - Pre-requisites:
    - Set up a GRR server instance.
    - Install and configure GRR Shell to connect to the GRR server.
    - Ensure you have valid GRR credentials to use GRR Shell.
  - Steps:
    - Step 1: Open a terminal and run GRR Shell.
    - Step 2: Use the `collect` command with a malicious payload in the `--remote-path` parameter to attempt command injection. Replace `<GRR_SERVER>`, `<USERNAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, and `<CLIENT_ID>` with your environment details.
      ```bash
      grrshell collect --grr-server <GRR_SERVER> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --client <CLIENT_ID> --remote-path "/tmp/evil; touch /tmp/pwned_collect" --local-path /tmp
      ```
    - Step 3: Alternatively, use the `artefact` command with a malicious payload in the `--artefact` parameter. For this test, you may need to define a dummy artefact named "EvilArtefact" on your GRR server.
      ```bash
      grrshell artefact --grr-server <GRR_SERVER> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --client <CLIENT_ID> --artefact "EvilArtefact; touch /tmp/pwned_artefact" --local-path /tmp
      ```
    - Step 4: After running the command, check the GRR server to see if the command injection was successful.
    - Step 5: Verify if the files `/tmp/pwned_collect` or `/tmp/pwned_artefact` (depending on the command used) have been created on the GRR server. You may need to access the GRR server's filesystem or check server logs to confirm file creation.
    - Step 6: If the files are created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability through unsanitized input in GRR Shell.
