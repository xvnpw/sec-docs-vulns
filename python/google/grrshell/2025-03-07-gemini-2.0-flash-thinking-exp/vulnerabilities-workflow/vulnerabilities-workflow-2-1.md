### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `collect` command via `--remote-path`
* Description:
    1. An attacker uses the `grrshell collect` command.
    2. The attacker provides a maliciously crafted string to the `--remote-path` parameter. This string contains command injection payloads.
    3. The `grrshell` application passes this unsanitized `--remote-path` value to the GRR server through the `ClientFileFinder` flow.
    4. If the GRR server or the `ClientFileFinder` flow on the server-side improperly handles or executes the provided path, it could lead to command injection on the GRR server or the target client.
    5. This command injection can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the GRR server or potentially compromise the target client system if the vulnerability propagates.
* Impact:
    - High. Successful command injection on the GRR server can lead to full control of the GRR server, data exfiltration, and further attacks on managed clients.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The code directly passes the user-provided `--remote-path` to the GRR API without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `--remote-path` in the `grrshell/cli/main.py` and `grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py` to prevent command injection.
    - Proper handling and sanitization of paths and patterns within the GRR server's `ClientFileFinder` flow to prevent command injection server-side.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to have access to use the `grrshell` command-line tool. This typically means having valid GRR credentials and access to a GRR server.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/grrshell/cli/main.py`
    2. **Function:** `Main._RunCommand(self, command: str)`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def _RunCommand(self, command: str) -> None:
        """Needs a better name.

        Args:
          command: The GRRShell command to run.
        """
        try:
          if command == 'collect':
            if not flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value:
              print(_USAGE())
              return
            self._client.CollectFiles(flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value,
                                      flags.FLAGS['local-path'].value)
    ```
    4. **Analysis:** The `_RunCommand` function handles the `collect` command. It retrieves the `--remote-path` value directly from `flags.FLAGS['remote-path'].value` and passes it to `self._client.CollectFiles()`. There is no sanitization or validation of the `remote_path` at this point.
    5. **File:** `/code/grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py`
    6. **Function:** `GRRShellClient.CollectFiles(self, remote_path: str, local_path: str)`
    7. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def CollectFiles(self, remote_path: str, local_path: str) -> None:
        """Collects files from the client.

        Args:
          remote_path: The remote path to collect.
          local_path: The local path to store the collected files.
        """
        flow_id = 'CLIENTFILEFINDERRUNNINGFLOWID'  # For test mocking.
        flow_id = self._StartClientFileFinderFlow(
            flow_id, flows_pb2.FileFinderAction.DOWNLOAD, remote_path)
        if not flow_id:
          return

        self._flow_monitor.MonitorFlow(flow_id, 'ClientFileFinder', 'DOWNLOAD',
                                        remote_path)
        self._DownloadFlowResultsInThread(flow_id, local_path)
    ```
    8. **Analysis:** The `CollectFiles` function in `grr_shell_client.py` takes the `remote_path` and passes it to `self._StartClientFileFinderFlow`. Again, no sanitization is performed here.
    9. **Function:** `GRRShellClient._StartClientFileFinderFlow(...)`
    10. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def _StartClientFileFinderFlow(self, flow_id: str, action: int,
                                     remote_path: str) -> str:
        """Starts a ClientFileFinder flow.

        Args:

          remote_path: The remote path to collect.

        Returns:
          The flow ID of the started flow, or None on error.
        """
        try:
          args = self._grr_stubby.types.CreateFlowArgs('ClientFileFinder')
          args.action.action_type = action
          args.paths.append(remote_path) # <--- Unsanitized input
          if action == flows_pb2.FileFinderAction.DOWNLOAD:
            if self._max_file_size > 0:
              args.action.download.max_size = self._max_file_size
          elif action == flows_pb2.FileFinderAction.HASH:
            args.action.hash.max_size = self._max_file_size

          launched_flow = self._grr_client.CreateFlow(
              client_id=self._client_id, name='ClientFileFinder', args=args)
          return launched_flow.flow_id
        except Exception as error:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
          print(f'Could not start ClientFileFinder flow: {error}')
          logger.exception('Could not start ClientFileFinder flow.')
          return None
    ```
    11. **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (--remote-path) --> grrshell/cli/main.py (_RunCommand) --> grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py (CollectFiles) --> grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py (_StartClientFileFinderFlow) --> GRR API (CreateFlow with unsanitized remote_path in args.paths) --> GRR Server (ClientFileFinder flow)
    ```
    12. **Conclusion:** The code directly uses the user-provided `remote_path` without any sanitization when creating the `ClientFileFinder` flow arguments. This could potentially lead to command injection if the GRR server or the `ClientFileFinder` flow is vulnerable to path-based command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have a GRR server and a GRR client set up and accessible via `grrshell`. Have necessary permissions to run flows on the client.
    2. **Action:** Execute the `grrshell collect` command with a malicious `--remote-path` designed for command injection. For example, try to inject a command after a valid path using shell metacharacters.
    ```bash
    grrshell collect --username=<GRR_USERNAME> --password=<GRR_PASSWORD> --grr-server=<GRR_SERVER_URL> --client=<CLIENT_ID> --remote-path="/tmp/test$(touch /tmp/pwned)" --local-path=/tmp/output
    ```
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - **Vulnerable:** If command injection is successful, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` would be executed on the GRR server (or potentially the client, depending on the server-side vulnerability). You can check for the existence of `/tmp/pwned` on the GRR server to confirm the injection.
        - **Not Vulnerable:** If mitigations are in place, the command injection should fail, and no `/tmp/pwned` file should be created. The `collect` command should either fail or treat the entire `--remote-path` as a literal path.
    4. **Note:** The success of this test case depends on the GRR server-side implementation of `ClientFileFinder` and how it handles paths. This test case validates if the GRR Shell is passing unsanitized input to the GRR server which is a precondition for command injection. Further investigation on the GRR server side would be needed to confirm the full exploitability.

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `find` command via `<regex>` parameter
* Description:
    1. An attacker uses the `grrshell shell` command to enter interactive shell mode.
    2. Within the shell, the attacker uses the `find` command, providing a malicious regex pattern as the `<regex>` argument. This regex contains command injection payloads.
    3. The `grrshell` application passes this unsanitized `<regex>` value to the GRR server, likely as part of a file searching or filtering operation.
    4. If the GRR server or the backend processing the `find` command's regex improperly handles or executes the provided regex, it could lead to command injection on the GRR server.
    5. This command injection can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the GRR server or potentially compromise the target client system if the vulnerability propagates.
* Impact:
    - High. Similar to the `collect` command injection, successful injection via `find` can compromise the GRR server.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The code directly passes the user-provided `<regex>` to the GRR server without sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `<regex>` in the `grrshell/lib/grr_shell_repl.py` and `grrshell/lib/grr_shell_client.py` to prevent command injection.
    - Secure regex processing on the GRR server-side to avoid vulnerabilities from malicious regex patterns.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to have access to use the `grrshell` interactive shell. This requires valid GRR credentials, access to a GRR server and a client.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/grrshell/lib/grr_shell_repl.py`
    2. **Function:** `GRRShellREPL._Find(self, params: list[str]) -> None`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def _Find(self, params: list[str]) -> None:
        """Handles the find command."""
        if not params:
          print(self._commands['find'].help_text)
          return

        if len(params) == 1:
          path = './'
          regex = params[0]
        elif len(params) == 2:
          path = params[0]
          regex = params[1]
        else:
          print(self._commands['find'].help_text)
          return

        results = self._emulated_fs.Find(path, regex) # <--- Unsanitized regex
        if not results:
          print('No files found.')
          return
        for res in results:
          print(res)
    ```
    4. **Analysis:** The `_Find` function in `grr_shell_repl.py` takes the `<regex>` from user input and passes it directly to `self._emulated_fs.Find()`.
    5. **File:** `/code/grrshell/lib/grr_shell_emulated_fs.py`
    6. **Function:** `GrrShellEmulatedFS.Find(self, base_dir: str, needle: str) -> list[str]`
    7. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def Find(self, base_dir: str, needle: str) -> list[str]:
        """Finds files matching a regex.

        Args:
          base_dir: The base directory to search in.
          needle: The regex to search for.

        Returns:
          A list of matching file paths.
        """
        if base_dir == '':
          base_dir = '/'
        if not self.RemotePathExists(base_dir, dirs_only=True):
          raise errors.InvalidRemotePathError(base_dir)

        if self.RemotePathExists(base_dir, dirs_only=False) and self.RemotePathExists(base_dir, dirs_only=True) is False:
          raise errors.IsAFileError(base_dir)

        if base_dir == '/':
          node = self._root
        else:
          node = self._ResolvePathToNode(base_dir)

        res = []
        for match in node.Find(needle): # <--- Regex used directly
          res.append(match.path)
        return res
    ```
    8. **Function:** `_EmulatedFSNode.Find(self, regex: str) -> list[_EmulatedFSNode]` within `GrrShellEmulatedFS` class.
    9. **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def Find(self, regex: str) -> list['_EmulatedFSNode']:
        """Recursively searches this node and children for filepaths matching regex."""
        res: list[_EmulatedFSNode] = []
        if re.search(regex, self.path): # <--- Regex search
          res.append(self)

        for _, child in self.children.items():
          res.extend(child.Find(regex))
        return res
    ```
    10. **Analysis:** The `Find` function in `grr_shell_emulated_fs.py` uses the provided `regex` directly with `re.search()`. While `re.search` itself is generally safe from direct command injection into the regex engine, vulnerabilities could arise depending on how the results of this regex search are used further down the line within GRR server. If the *paths* returned by `Find` are later used in unsafe operations on the server, and an attacker can control the matched paths through a malicious regex, it could indirectly lead to issues.  The primary risk here is not direct command injection through `re.search`, but rather potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in GRR server's path handling if malicious regex can influence path matching.
    11. **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (<regex>) --> grrshell/lib/grr_shell_repl.py (_Find) --> grrshell/lib/grr_shell_emulated_fs.py (Find) --> re.search(regex, path) --> Matched Paths --> Potentially Unsafe Operations on GRR Server (if path handling is vulnerable)
    ```
    12. **Conclusion:** Although direct command injection via `re.search` is unlikely, the unsanitized `<regex>` parameter could still be a vulnerability if it allows an attacker to manipulate path matching in a way that exploits other vulnerabilities within the GRR server's path processing logic.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have a GRR server, a GRR client, and `grrshell` interactive shell access.
    2. **Action:** Execute the `find` command in the `grrshell` interactive shell with a malicious regex pattern.
    ```bash
    grrshell shell --username=<GRR_USERNAME> --password=<GRR_PASSWORD> --grr-server=<GRR_SERVER_URL> --client=<CLIENT_ID>
    grrshell> find '.*$(touch /tmp/pwned).*'
    ```
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - **Vulnerable:** If command injection is successful due to regex manipulation leading to path processing vulnerabilities on the server, the command `touch /tmp/pwned` might be executed on the GRR server. Check for the existence of `/tmp/pwned` on the GRR server.
        - **Not Vulnerable:** If mitigations are in place or the server-side path processing is secure against this type of manipulation, no `/tmp/pwned` file should be created. The `find` command should execute without unintended side effects.
    4. **Note:** Similar to the `collect` test case, the success is contingent on server-side vulnerabilities in path handling. This test case verifies if `grrshell` passes unsanitized regex, creating a precondition for potential server-side exploitation.

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `info` command via `<path>` parameter (less likely, requires server-side vulnerability)
* Description:
    - Similar to `collect` and `find`, the `info` command takes a `<path>` as input. If the GRR server's `ClientFileFinder` flow, used by `info`, is vulnerable to command injection through path manipulation, then the unsanitized `<path>` provided by the user could be exploited.
* Impact:
    - Medium to High. Impact depends on the severity of command injection vulnerability on the GRR server-side.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided client-side code.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `<path>` in `info` command, although the vulnerability is more likely to be server-side.
* Preconditions:
    - GRR Shell access. Vulnerability is primarily on the GRR server.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The code flow for `info` is similar to `collect`, using `ClientFileFinder` flow and passing the user-provided `<path>` without sanitization.  Refer to the source code analysis for `collect` vulnerability, the path is passed to `ClientFileFinder` in the same unsanitized way.
* Security Test Case:
    - Similar test case as for `collect`, but using the `info` command:
    ```bash
    grrshell shell --username=<GRR_USERNAME> --password=<GRR_PASSWORD> --grr-server=<GRR_SERVER_URL> --client=<CLIENT_ID>
    grrshell> info "/tmp/test$(touch /tmp/pwned)"
    ```
    - Check for `/tmp/pwned` on the GRR server.
