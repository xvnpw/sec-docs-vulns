### Vulnerability List:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Benchmark Filename Processing

*   **Description:**
    1. The `reconstruct.py` script processes benchmark files located in the `remapped_benchmarks/` directory.
    2. It reads the list of benchmark filenames from the directory using `os.listdir(base_path)`.
    3. For each filename obtained from `os.listdir()`, it constructs an output file path by joining the `output_path` (which is `extracted_benchmarks/[suite]/`) with the filename directly using `os.path.join(output_path, benchmark)`.
    4. If an attacker can place a malicious file with a crafted filename containing path traversal sequences (like `../`) within the `remapped_benchmarks/` directory, the `os.path.join` operation will resolve to a path outside of the intended `extracted_benchmarks/` directory.
    5. Consequently, when the script attempts to create and write to the output file using this path, it can write files to arbitrary locations on the file system, depending on the path traversal sequence in the malicious filename.

*   **Impact:**
    An attacker can achieve arbitrary file write on the system where `reconstruct.py` is executed. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    *   **Overwriting critical system files:** An attacker could overwrite configuration files, scripts, or even binaries, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
    *   **Planting malicious files:** An attacker could write executable files (e.g., scripts, binaries) in locations where they might be automatically executed or easily triggered by users or other system processes, leading to code execution and further compromise.
    *   **Data exfiltration (indirect):** While direct data exfiltration isn't the primary impact, an attacker might be able to overwrite files that are later accessed or transmitted, indirectly leading to data leaks.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly uses filenames from `os.listdir()` without any validation or sanitization before using them in `os.path.join` to create output file paths.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Filename Sanitization:** The application is missing input sanitization for benchmark filenames obtained from `os.listdir()`. Filenames should be validated to ensure they do not contain path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) or other potentially dangerous sequences. A whitelist approach for allowed characters in filenames could also be implemented.
    *   **Secure Path Handling:** Instead of directly joining filenames, the application should use secure path handling techniques. For example, it could verify that the resolved output path is still within the intended `extracted_benchmarks/` directory.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file with a crafted filename into one of the directories under `remapped_benchmarks/`, specifically within the benchmark suite directories (e.g., `remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/`). This might be possible if the application or the setup process involves unpacking archives or copying files from external sources where an attacker could inject malicious files. The README.md indicates that users are expected to download and extract benchmark datasets into `source_data/`. If the `remapped_benchmarks/` are generated from these `source_data/` and if the process of generating `remapped_benchmarks/` doesn't sanitize filenames, then the vulnerability can be triggered.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`reconstruct.py`:** The script starts by importing necessary modules and variables from `index_builder.py`.
    ```python
    import os
    from index_builder import *
    ```
    2. **Benchmark Suite Iteration:** The script iterates through predefined `benchmark_suites`.
    ```python
    for suite in benchmark_suites:
        base_path = os.path.join(remap_dir, suite, '')
        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, suite, '')
        # ...
    ```
    `base_path` is constructed using `remap_dir` ("remapped_benchmarks/") and the current `suite` (e.g., "Snappy-COMPRESS"). `output_path` is constructed using `output_dir` ("extracted_benchmarks/") and the current `suite`.
    3. **Listing Benchmark Files:** The script lists all files within the `base_path` using `os.listdir(base_path)`. This is the crucial point where filenames are read from the file system, and no validation is performed on these filenames.
    ```python
    all_benchmarks = os.listdir(base_path)
    for benchmark in all_benchmarks:
        # ...
    ```
    For example, if `base_path` is `remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/` and this directory contains a malicious file named `../../../evil.txt`, then `all_benchmarks` will include `../../../evil.txt`.
    4. **Output Path Construction:** Inside the loop, the script constructs the output file path by directly joining `output_path` and `benchmark` using `os.path.join`.
    ```python
    with open(os.path.join(output_path, benchmark), 'wb') as bench_extracted:
        bench_extracted.write(output_data)
    ```
    If `output_path` is `extracted_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/` and `benchmark` is `../../../evil.txt`, then `os.path.join(output_path, benchmark)` will result in the path `extracted_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/../../../evil.txt`, which simplifies to `extracted_benchmarks/../../evil.txt`. This allows writing the file `evil.txt` in the directory above `extracted_benchmarks/`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/malicious_file.txt (Content: [(0, 0)])
                                        ../../../evil.txt (Content: [(0, 0)])  <-- Malicious file

    reconstruct.py --> Reads filenames from remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/

    output_dir = "extracted_benchmarks/"
    output_path = extracted_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/

    For benchmark in ["malicious_file.txt", "../../../evil.txt"]:
        output_file_path = os.path.join(output_path, benchmark)
        # For benchmark = "../../../evil.txt":
        # output_file_path becomes extracted_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/../../../evil.txt  => extracted_benchmarks/../../evil.txt

        Write content to output_file_path
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Environment:** Ensure you have set up the project as described in `README.md`, including creating the `source_data` directory and downloading the benchmark datasets.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Benchmark File:**
        *   Create the directory `remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/` if it doesn't exist.
        *   Inside `remapped_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/`, create a new file named `../../../evil.txt`.
        *   Add valid benchmark data to this file. For example, insert the text `[(0, 0)]` into `../../../evil.txt`. This is valid input for `eval()` in the script.
    3. **Run `reconstruct.py`:** Execute the `reconstruct.py` script from the command line: `python3 reconstruct.py`
    4. **Verify File Creation:** After the script execution completes, check for the creation of the file `evil.txt` in the directory *above* the `extracted_benchmarks` directory. If `extracted_benchmarks` is in the project's root directory, `evil.txt` should be created in the project's root directory.
    5. **Check File Content:** Verify that the content of `evil.txt` is as expected based on the benchmark data you put in `../../../evil.txt` (in this case, it should contain the first 1024 bytes of the first file in `indexable_file_contents`, which is likely from `Calgary/bib`).

    If the file `evil.txt` is created outside the `extracted_benchmarks/Snappy-COMPRESS/` directory with the expected content, this confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
