### Vulnerability 1: Insecure Deserialization

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization of Symbolic Objects
- **Description:**
    - PyGlove is designed to manipulate Python objects, including serializing and deserializing symbolic representations of Python code.
    - If an application using PyGlove deserializes symbolic objects from untrusted sources, it becomes vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
    - An attacker could craft a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized by PyGlove, executes arbitrary code on the server or client machine.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized PyGlove symbolic object.
        2. The attacker sends this malicious payload to an application that uses PyGlove and performs deserialization without proper validation.
        3. The PyGlove library deserializes the object.
        4. Due to the nature of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities in Python (e.g., using `pickle`), malicious code embedded in the serialized data gets executed during the deserialization process.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other severe security incidents.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The provided files do not contain any specific code related to serialization or deserialization functions within the PyGlove library itself. Therefore, there are no project-level mitigations visible in the provided files. The README mentions usage in AutoML and evolutionary computing which are contexts where serialization/deserialization might be used, suggesting potential risk.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for deserialized data.
    - Avoiding or securing the use of inherently unsafe deserialization methods like `pickle` for untrusted data.
    - Documentation and warnings to users about the risks of insecure deserialization and best practices to avoid it, such as only deserializing data from trusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An application using PyGlove library must be in place that deserializes PyGlove symbolic objects.
    - The application must load serialized data from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, network data).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The provided files are mostly documentation, setup scripts, and test code. There is no direct code in these files that implements deserialization.
    - However, the `README.md` and `/code/pyglove/core/__init__.py` files describe PyGlove as a "general-purpose library for Python object manipulation" and "symbolic programming for automated machine learning". This nature of PyGlove implies that serialization and deserialization are likely core functionalities, making insecure deserialization a relevant attack vector. Further code analysis of the core library files (not provided) would be needed to pinpoint the exact deserialization points and confirm this vulnerability.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a dummy Python application that uses PyGlove.
        - In this application, implement a function that deserializes a PyGlove symbolic object from a file (representing untrusted input).
    2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
        - Craft a malicious serialized PyGlove symbolic object. This would typically involve leveraging Python's `pickle` or similar serialization tools to embed code execution commands within the serialized data.
        - Save the malicious serialized object to a file.
    3. **Execution:**
        - Run the dummy application and provide the path to the malicious file as input to the deserialization function.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Observe if arbitrary code execution occurs. A successful test would demonstrate code execution outside the intended application logic, confirming the insecure deserialization vulnerability. For example, the test can check for the creation of a file, execution of a command, or any other observable out-of-band action triggered by the malicious payload.
