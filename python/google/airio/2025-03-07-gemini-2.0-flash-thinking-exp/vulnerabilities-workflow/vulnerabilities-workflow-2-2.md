Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you would like me to update. I need the list of vulnerabilities to be able to filter and format them according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Analyze each vulnerability** against your inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2.  **Filter out** vulnerabilities that do not meet the inclusion criteria or match any of the exclusion criteria.
3.  **Format the remaining valid vulnerabilities** in markdown according to your specified structure, including:
    *   Vulnerability Name
    *   Description (step-by-step trigger)
    *   Impact
    *   Vulnerability Rank (High or Critical)
    *   Currently Implemented Mitigations
    *   Missing Mitigations
    *   Preconditions
    *   Source Code Analysis (detailed, step-by-step)
    *   Security Test Case (step-by-step, external attacker scenario)
4.  **Return the formatted list** or an empty list if no vulnerabilities meet the criteria.

**Example of how I will process a hypothetical vulnerability once you provide the list:**

Let's assume you provide the following vulnerability in your list:

```
Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization
Description: AirIO uses pickle.load to deserialize data files without proper sanitization.
Impact: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
Vulnerability Rank: critical
Currently implemented mitigations: None
Missing mitigations: Input validation, using safer serialization methods.
Preconditions: AirIO processes user-provided data files using pickle.load.
Source code analysis: (Assume I would provide a detailed code analysis here)
Security test case: (Assume I would provide a detailed test case here)
```

I would then check if this vulnerability meets your criteria:

*   **Valid vulnerability and part of attack vector:** Yes, it's a valid vulnerability related to malicious data injection via AirIO input files.
*   **Not missing documentation mitigation:** Yes.
*   **Not denial of service:** No, it's arbitrary code execution.
*   **Realistic exploit:** Yes, pickle deserialization vulnerabilities are realistic.
*   **Completely described:** Let's assume the description, source code analysis, and test case are complete (as indicated by placeholders above).
*   **Not theoretical, evidence of exploit:** Let's assume the source code analysis shows how it's exploitable.
*   **High or critical severity:** Yes, it's critical.

Since this hypothetical vulnerability meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, I would include it in the output, formatted as you requested in markdown.

**Please provide the list of vulnerabilities so I can proceed with the update.**
