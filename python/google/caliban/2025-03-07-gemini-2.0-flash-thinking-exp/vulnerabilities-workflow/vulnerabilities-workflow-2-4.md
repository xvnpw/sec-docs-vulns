- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Experiment Configuration

- Description:
  Caliban allows users to define experiment configurations using JSON files, which can be passed via the `--experiment_config` flag to `caliban run` and `caliban cloud` commands. This configuration can include flag values that are then passed as arguments to the user-provided script executed within a Docker container. If these flag values are not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands. Specifically, by crafting a malicious JSON configuration file with a flag value containing shell metacharacters, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands within the Docker container or the cloud execution environment when Caliban expands and processes this configuration.

  Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Create a malicious JSON configuration file (e.g., `malicious_config.json`).
    2. In this JSON file, define an experiment configuration where a flag value contains shell command injection payload. For example: `{"learning_rate": ["0.01; bash -c 'touch /tmp/pwned'"]}`. This attempts to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory inside the Docker container.
    3. Run a Caliban command (e.g., `caliban run --experiment_config malicious_config.json --nogpu mnist.py`) using this malicious configuration file.
    4. Caliban will parse the JSON configuration, expand the experiments, and construct Docker commands to run each experiment.
    5. Due to insufficient sanitization, the injected command `bash -c 'touch /tmp/pwned'` will be executed by the shell within the Docker container during the execution of `mnist.py`.

- Impact:
  Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the Docker container. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing and stealing sensitive data within the container's environment.
    - Malware installation: Installing malware or backdoors within the container.
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially escalating privileges within the container or, in some scenarios, escaping the container to affect the host system or cloud environment.
    - Denial of Service: Disrupting the intended operation of the experiment or the Caliban tool itself.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: Based on the source code analysis, there is no explicit input sanitization or validation implemented for the flag values read from the experiment configuration files before they are passed to the shell within the Docker container.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all flag values read from experiment configurations. Shell metacharacters and potentially harmful commands should be escaped or removed before constructing and executing shell commands.
    - Input Validation: Validate the structure and content of experiment configuration files against a strict schema to prevent unexpected or malicious inputs.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that the Docker containers and cloud execution environments run with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious experiment configuration file to Caliban, either by directly modifying a configuration file used by the user, or by tricking the user into using a malicious configuration.
    - Caliban must be configured to use the provided malicious experiment configuration file via the `--experiment_config` flag.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `caliban/cli.py`
  2. Function: `caliban.cli.parse_flags(argv)` is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, including `--experiment_config`.
  3. File: `caliban/config/experiment.py`
  4. Function: `caliban.config.experiment.load_experiment_config(s)` loads the experiment configuration from a JSON file or stdin.
  5. Function: `caliban.config.experiment.expand_experiment_config(items)` expands the experiment configuration into a list of experiments.
  6. Function: `caliban.config.experiment.experiment_to_args(m, base)` converts an experiment dictionary to a list of command-line arguments. This function does not perform any sanitization of the values.
  7. File: `caliban/platform/run.py`
  8. Function: `caliban.platform.run.run_experiments(...)` and `caliban.platform.run.run(...)` use the arguments generated by `experiment_to_args` to construct and execute Docker commands via `subprocess.call` or `ufs.capture_stdout`.
  9. The code path from parsing the experiment configuration to executing the Docker command does not include any sanitization of the flag values. The values from the JSON configuration are directly converted to strings and passed as arguments in the Docker `run` command, making command injection possible.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a file named `malicious_config.json` in the current directory with the following content:
```json
{
  "learning_rate": ["0.01; touch /tmp/caliban_pwned"]
}
```
  2. Execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
caliban run --experiment_config malicious_config.json --nogpu tutorials/basic/mnist.py
```
  3. After the command execution finishes, enter the Docker container using `caliban shell --nogpu`.
```bash
caliban shell --nogpu
```
  4. Inside the Docker container shell, check if the file `/tmp/caliban_pwned` exists:
```bash
ls /tmp/caliban_pwned
```
  5. If the file `/tmp/caliban_pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, as the `touch /tmp/caliban_pwned` command was executed inside the Docker container.
