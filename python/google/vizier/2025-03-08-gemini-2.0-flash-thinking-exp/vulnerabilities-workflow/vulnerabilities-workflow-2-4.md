- vulnerability name: Deserialization Vulnerability in `restore_dna_spec`
- description: |
  The `restore_dna_spec` function in `/code/vizier/_src/pyglove/converters.py` deserializes a compressed JSON string to reconstruct a `pg.DNASpec` object.
  If an attacker can control the content of this compressed JSON string, they could potentially inject malicious code.

  Steps to trigger vulnerability:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON string that, when decompressed and deserialized by `restore_dna_spec`, executes arbitrary code. This malicious JSON string would need to be crafted to exploit known vulnerabilities in the `json.loads` or `pg.from_json` functions, or in the libraries they utilize during deserialization, when handling complex Python objects or custom classes that might be part of `pg.DNASpec`.
  2. The attacker provides this malicious JSON string to the Vizier service in a context where `restore_dna_spec` is used to process it. This could be through various API endpoints that accept study configurations or objective functions in serialized form.
  3. The Vizier service calls `restore_dna_spec` to deserialize the provided JSON string.
  4. If the malicious JSON string is successfully crafted, the deserialization process executes the attacker's injected code.
- impact: |
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Vizier server. An attacker could gain complete control of the server, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting service availability.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations:
  * There are no explicit mitigations in the provided code snippets to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities. The code relies on standard Python libraries for JSON handling and LZMA compression, without any custom security measures for deserialization.
- missing mitigations:
  * Input validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization to check the structure and content of the compressed JSON string before deserialization. This could include schema validation and checks for unexpected or disallowed object types within the JSON data.
  * Sandboxing or isolation: Execute the deserialization process in a sandboxed environment or isolated process with limited privileges to contain the impact of potential exploits.
  * Use safe deserialization methods: Explore and utilize safer alternatives to `json.loads` and `pg.from_json` if available, or configure them to restrict the deserialization of potentially dangerous Python objects. However, based on the description, the risk is inherent in deserializing untrusted data in this manner.
- preconditions: |
  * The Vizier service must be configured to process study configurations or objective functions from untrusted sources. This is implied by the project description, which mentions processing these from untrusted sources.
  * An attacker must be able to send a crafted request containing the malicious JSON string to the Vizier service. This assumes the Vizier service exposes an API endpoint that processes such data.

  File: `/code/vizier/_src/pyglove/converters.py`

  ```python
  def restore_dna_spec(json_str_compressed: str) -> pg.DNASpec:
    """Restores DNASpec from compressed JSON str."""
    return pg.from_json(
        json.loads(lzma.decompress(base64.b64decode(json_str_compressed)))
    )
  ```

  1. The function `restore_dna_spec` takes a compressed JSON string (`json_str_compressed`) as input.
  2. It first decodes the base64 encoded string using `base64.b64decode(json_str_compressed)`.
  3. The decoded string is then decompressed using `lzma.decompress(...)`.
  4. Finally, the decompressed data is deserialized from JSON format into a Python object using `json.loads(...)`.
  5. The `pg.from_json(...)` function is then used to convert the deserialized Python object into a `pg.DNASpec` object.

  An attacker can exploit this process by crafting a `json_str_compressed` that, after base64 decoding and LZMA decompression, results in a JSON payload containing malicious instructions. When `json.loads` and `pg.from_json` process this payload, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- security test case: |
  1. Setup:
     - Prepare a malicious JSON payload. This payload should be designed to execute a simple command (e.g., print a message to a file or make a network request to attacker's server) upon deserialization. The exact structure of this payload will depend on the libraries used by `pg.from_json` and `json.loads` and the nature of deserialization vulnerabilities they are susceptible to. Since `pg.from_json` might involve custom deserialization logic, focus on crafting a payload that exploits vulnerabilities within `pg.from_json` or its underlying dependencies.
     - Compress the malicious JSON payload using LZMA compression and then encode it using Base64, resulting in `malicious_json_str_compressed`.
  2. Action:
     - As an external attacker, send a request to the Vizier service that includes `malicious_json_str_compressed` as the study configuration. This step assumes you can interact with the Vizier service in a way that allows providing a custom study configuration, potentially through the client API or a direct HTTP request if the service exposes such an endpoint. You might need to identify an API endpoint that utilizes `restore_dna_spec` for processing input.
  3. Expectation:
     - Observe the Vizier server for signs of arbitrary code execution. This could involve checking for:
        - The execution of the command injected in the malicious JSON payload (e.g., presence of the output file or successful network request to the attacker's server).
        - Unexpected behavior or errors in the Vizier service logs indicating a deserialization issue and potential code execution.
     - If the injected command is executed on the server, the vulnerability is confirmed.
     - Examine server logs for any error messages or unusual activity during the test, which could further indicate a successful exploit attempt or a deserialization vulnerability.

This test case is designed to validate the deserialization vulnerability by attempting to trigger arbitrary code execution. A successful test case would demonstrate that an external attacker can indeed execute code on the Vizier server by providing a malicious study configuration.
