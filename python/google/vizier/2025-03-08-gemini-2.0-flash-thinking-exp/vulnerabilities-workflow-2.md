## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Objective Function (Python Code Injection)
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python objective function.
  2. The attacker submits this malicious objective function to the Vizier service as part of a study configuration (e.g., in the `evaluate` function within the Python code provided to the Vizier client). This can be achieved when creating or updating a Vizier Study.
  3. The Vizier client sends this StudyConfig to the Vizier service to create or load a study.
  4. The Vizier service, upon receiving the StudyConfig, stores it and uses it during the optimization process.
  5. When the Vizier service executes an optimization task for this study, it will load and execute the user-provided objective function without proper sandboxing or security checks.
  6. During the optimization process, when a trial is evaluated, the Vizier service executes the objective function. The malicious code within the objective function is executed by the Vizier service.
- Impact:
  - **Critical**
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Vizier server or in the evaluation environment.
  - Arbitrary code execution on the Vizier service.
  - Full compromise of the Vizier server, including data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Full compromise of the Vizier service and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
  - Data exfiltration or manipulation.
  - Unauthorized access to internal resources.
  - Potential for lateral movement to other systems accessible from the Vizier server.
  - Data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks on the infrastructure.
- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **None**. The provided code does not include any input validation or sandboxing for user-provided Python code. The files focus on service architecture, client communication, data storage, and algorithm selection, but lack any input sanitization or secure execution environment mechanisms for user-provided objective functions.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Sanitization and Validation**: While difficult for arbitrary Python code, basic checks could be implemented to detect obvious malicious patterns. However, this is not a sufficient mitigation. Input sanitization and validation for objective function definitions to prevent injection of arbitrary code.
  - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: The most effective mitigation is to execute user-provided objective functions in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions, preventing access to sensitive resources and system commands. This could involve using containers, VMs, or secure execution environments. Secure execution environment (sandboxing, containerization) for objective functions to limit the impact of malicious code execution.
  - **Principle of least privilege**: Apply the principle of least privilege to the Vizier service account to minimize the impact of a compromise.
  - **Code review**: Conduct code review focusing on secure handling of user-provided code and prevention of code injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Runtime security monitoring**: Implement runtime security monitoring to detect and prevent malicious activities.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to submit a study configuration to a publicly accessible Vizier service instance. This is generally the intended use case of the Open Source Vizier, so it's a common precondition. An attacker must be able to create or modify a Vizier Study, which typically requires being an authenticated user of the Vizier service. However, if study creation is publicly accessible without authentication, the precondition is simply network access to the Vizier service.
  - The Vizier service must be configured to execute user-provided Python objective functions. This is assumed to be the intended functionality based on the project description.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The `README.md` file provides an example where the `evaluate` function is defined by the user and directly used in the client code.
  - The client code in `README.md` and `demos/run_vizier_client.py` shows how a user-defined Python function (`evaluate_trial` or `evaluate`) is passed to the Vizier client and intended to be executed.
  - Files like `vizier/service/clients/__init__.py` and `vizier/service/__init__.py` suggest the presence of client-server architecture, implying that the `evaluate` function, if a remote address is provided, will be executed by the Vizier service.
  - The provided code lacks any explicit mechanism to sanitize or restrict the execution of the user-provided objective function within the Vizier service.
  - The provided PROJECT FILES do not contain the explicit source code that loads and executes user-provided Python objective functions. However, based on the description and the architecture of Vizier as a client-server system for black-box optimization and hyperparameter tuning, the following code flow is inferred:
    1. The Vizier Client (using `vizier_client.py`) sends a `CreateStudyRequest` or similar request containing a `StudyConfig` to the Vizier Service (`vizier_service.py`). This `StudyConfig` includes the definition of the objective function, potentially as Python code.
    2. The Vizier Service receives the `CreateStudyRequest` and stores the `StudyConfig` in the datastore (using `datastore.py`, `sql_datastore.py` or `ram_datastore.py`).
    3. During the optimization process (likely managed by `vizier_service.py` and policies from `policy_factory.py` and `pythia_service.py`), when a Trial needs to be evaluated, the Vizier Service retrieves the `StudyConfig` from the datastore.
    4. The Vizier Service then loads and executes the Python code from the objective function definition within the `StudyConfig` to evaluate the Trial.
    5. **Vulnerability Point**: If the Vizier Service directly executes the user-provided Python code without sanitization or sandboxing, any malicious code embedded in the objective function will be executed with the privileges of the Vizier Service.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Setup a Vizier service instance using `demos/run_vizier_server.py`.
  2. Create a malicious Python objective function (e.g., to execute system command `whoami` and write the output to a file):
     ```python
     import os
     def evaluate(w: float, x: int, y: float, z: str) -> float:
       os.system('whoami > /tmp/vizier_exploit.txt')
       return w**2 - y**2 + x * ord(z)
     ```
     Alternatively, craft a malicious StudyConfig. This StudyConfig includes a Python objective function that, when executed, will perform a malicious action (e.g., create a file, execute a system command, initiate a reverse shell). For example, the objective function could be defined to execute `import os; os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')`.
  3. Modify the `Getting Started` example in `README.md` or `demos/run_vizier_client.py` to use the malicious `evaluate` function. Or Attacker uses the Vizier client (e.g., `vizier_client_test.py` or a custom client using `vizier_client.py`) to create a new study using `vizier_client.create_or_load_study` or similar function, providing the malicious StudyConfig.
  4. Run the modified client code, connecting to the Vizier service instance. Or Attacker initiates the optimization process for the created study, for example by requesting suggestions using `vizier_client.get_suggestions`.
  5. Check the Vizier server's filesystem (e.g., `/tmp` directory) for the existence of the `vizier_exploit.txt` file containing the output of the `whoami` command or `/tmp/pwned` file. If the file exists and contains the expected output, the vulnerability is confirmed.
  6. (Optional) For a more sophisticated test, the malicious code could establish a reverse shell back to the attacker, allowing for interactive control of the Vizier server.

### 2. Deserialization Vulnerability in `restore_dna_spec`
- Description:
  The `restore_dna_spec` function in `/code/vizier/_src/pyglove/converters.py` deserializes a compressed JSON string to reconstruct a `pg.DNASpec` object.
  If an attacker can control the content of this compressed JSON string, they could potentially inject malicious code.

  Steps to trigger vulnerability:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON string that, when decompressed and deserialized by `restore_dna_spec`, executes arbitrary code. This malicious JSON string would need to be crafted to exploit known vulnerabilities in the `json.loads` or `pg.from_json` functions, or in the libraries they utilize during deserialization, when handling complex Python objects or custom classes that might be part of `pg.DNASpec`.
  2. The attacker provides this malicious JSON string to the Vizier service in a context where `restore_dna_spec` is used to process it. This could be through various API endpoints that accept study configurations or objective functions in serialized form.
  3. The Vizier service calls `restore_dna_spec` to deserialize the provided JSON string.
  4. If the malicious JSON string is successfully crafted, the deserialization process executes the attacker's injected code.
- Impact:
  - **Critical**
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Vizier server. An attacker could gain complete control of the server, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting service availability.
- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - There are no explicit mitigations in the provided code snippets to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities. The code relies on standard Python libraries for JSON handling and LZMA compression, without any custom security measures for deserialization.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input validation**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization to check the structure and content of the compressed JSON string before deserialization. This could include schema validation and checks for unexpected or disallowed object types within the JSON data.
  - **Sandboxing or isolation**: Execute the deserialization process in a sandboxed environment or isolated process with limited privileges to contain the impact of potential exploits.
  - **Use safe deserialization methods**: Explore and utilize safer alternatives to `json.loads` and `pg.from_json` if available, or configure them to restrict the deserialization of potentially dangerous Python objects. However, based on the description, the risk is inherent in deserializing untrusted data in this manner.
- Preconditions:
  - The Vizier service must be configured to process study configurations or objective functions from untrusted sources. This is implied by the project description, which mentions processing these from untrusted sources.
  - An attacker must be able to send a crafted request containing the malicious JSON string to the Vizier service. This assumes the Vizier service exposes an API endpoint that processes such data.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/vizier/_src/pyglove/converters.py`
  ```python
  def restore_dna_spec(json_str_compressed: str) -> pg.DNASpec:
    """Restores DNASpec from compressed JSON str."""
    return pg.from_json(
        json.loads(lzma.decompress(base64.b64decode(json_str_compressed)))
    )
  ```
  1. The function `restore_dna_spec` takes a compressed JSON string (`json_str_compressed`) as input.
  2. It first decodes the base64 encoded string using `base64.b64decode(json_str_compressed)`.
  3. The decoded string is then decompressed using `lzma.decompress(...)`.
  4. Finally, the decompressed data is deserialized from JSON format into a Python object using `json.loads(...)`.
  5. The `pg.from_json(...)` function is then used to convert the deserialized Python object into a `pg.DNASpec` object.

  An attacker can exploit this process by crafting a `json_str_compressed` that, after base64 decoding and LZMA decompression, results in a JSON payload containing malicious instructions. When `json.loads` and `pg.from_json` process this payload, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Setup:
     - Prepare a malicious JSON payload. This payload should be designed to execute a simple command (e.g., print a message to a file or make a network request to attacker's server) upon deserialization. The exact structure of this payload will depend on the libraries used by `pg.from_json` and `json.loads` and the nature of deserialization vulnerabilities they are susceptible to. Since `pg.from_json` might involve custom deserialization logic, focus on crafting a payload that exploits vulnerabilities within `pg.from_json` or its underlying dependencies.
     - Compress the malicious JSON payload using LZMA compression and then encode it using Base64, resulting in `malicious_json_str_compressed`.
  2. Action:
     - As an external attacker, send a request to the Vizier service that includes `malicious_json_str_compressed` as the study configuration. This step assumes you can interact with the Vizier service in a way that allows providing a custom study configuration, potentially through the client API or a direct HTTP request if the service exposes such an endpoint. You might need to identify an API endpoint that utilizes `restore_dna_spec` for processing input.
  3. Expectation:
     - Observe the Vizier server for signs of arbitrary code execution. This could involve checking for:
        - The execution of the command injected in the malicious JSON payload (e.g., presence of the output file or successful network request to the attacker's server).
        - Unexpected behavior or errors in the Vizier service logs indicating a deserialization issue and potential code execution.
     - If the injected command is executed on the server, the vulnerability is confirmed.
     - Examine server logs for any error messages or unusual activity during the test, which could further indicate a successful exploit attempt or a deserialization vulnerability.
