- Vulnerability Name: Looker Studio Dashboard Public Sharing
- Description:
    1. A user installs Shopping Insider and sets up the Looker Studio dashboards using the provided templates as described in `/code/README.md`.
    2. The user misconfigures the sharing settings of the Looker Studio dashboard. This can happen by accidentally selecting "Anyone with the link" or "Public on the web" options instead of restricting access to specific users or groups within their organization.
    3. An external attacker, without authorized access to the Google Cloud project or Looker Studio assets, discovers the publicly shared link to the Looker Studio dashboard. This could occur through various means, such as accidental link leakage, web scraping, or social engineering.
    4. The attacker uses the publicly shared link to access the Looker Studio dashboard.
    5. The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive Google Shopping Ads performance data and feed health information displayed in the dashboard. This data is derived from the user's Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts, which are connected to BigQuery through the Shopping Insider setup.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive business data, including Google Shopping Ads performance metrics, product data, and potentially competitive insights.
    - Reputational damage to the retailer due to a perceived or actual data breach.
    - Potential financial losses if competitors or malicious actors use the leaked data for their advantage.
    - Erosion of customer trust due to potential privacy violations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project itself does not implement any technical mitigations to prevent public sharing of Looker Studio dashboards. The sharing settings are entirely managed within the Looker Studio platform by the user. The provided files do not contain any code or configurations that directly address Looker Studio sharing permissions. The `/code/README.md` mentions sharing dashboards but does not include security warnings or best practices for secure sharing.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Security Warning in README.md:** Add a prominent security warning in the `/code/README.md` file, specifically in the "Create Data-Studio Dashboard(s)" section, highlighting the risks of publicly sharing Looker Studio dashboards and advising users to configure sharing settings carefully, restricting access to authorized personnel only.
    - **Best Practices Documentation:** Create a dedicated document or section in the README detailing best practices for securely sharing Looker Studio dashboards. This should include recommendations like:
        - Sharing dashboards only with specific Google accounts or Google Groups within the organization.
        - Avoiding "Anyone with the link" or "Public on the web" sharing options for sensitive data dashboards.
        - Regularly reviewing and auditing dashboard sharing settings.
        - Educating users about the risks of public data exposure.
    - **Installation Guide Enhancement:** In the installation steps, particularly in sections 2.2.2.6 and 2.2.1.5 related to dashboard creation, add explicit instructions to guide users on how to configure secure sharing settings in Looker Studio immediately after creating the dashboards.
- Preconditions:
    1. The Shopping Insider project is successfully installed and configured by a user.
    2. The user creates Looker Studio dashboards using the provided templates and connects them to their BigQuery data.
    3. The user, either unintentionally or due to lack of awareness of security best practices, misconfigures the sharing settings of at least one Looker Studio dashboard, making it accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., "Anyone with the link" access).
    4. An attacker discovers the publicly accessible link to the misconfigured Looker Studio dashboard.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided source code files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `/code/setup.sh`, `/code/config.yaml`, `/code/config_parser.py`, `/code/cloud_data_transfer.py`, `/code/cloud_bigquery.py`, `/code/cloud_env_setup.py`, `/code/auth.py`, files in `/code/plugins/cloud_utils/`, `/code/requirements.txt`) do not directly manage or configure Looker Studio dashboard sharing settings.
    - The vulnerability arises from the user's configuration of Looker Studio, which is a separate Google Cloud product, after deploying Shopping Insider.
    - The `/code/README.md` file provides links to Looker Studio dashboard templates and instructions on how to create dashboards using these templates in section "2.2.2.6. Create Data-Studio Dashboard(s)" and "2.2.1.5. Deploy Shopping Insider". However, it lacks explicit security warnings or guidance regarding the importance of secure sharing configurations for these dashboards.
    - The scripts (`/code/setup.sh`, `/code/cloud_env_setup.py`) are focused on setting up the data pipeline in Google Cloud (BigQuery, Data Transfer) and do not interact with Looker Studio sharing settings.
    - The vulnerability is therefore not a flaw in the provided code but rather a potential misconfiguration risk in the user's Looker Studio environment, which is exacerbated by the lack of sufficient security guidance within the project's documentation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Google Cloud project, Google Merchant Center account, and Google Ads account set up. Install Shopping Insider in your Google Cloud project following the instructions in `/code/README.md`, and create the Looker Studio dashboards as described.
    2. **Misconfigure Dashboard Sharing:** Open one of the newly created Looker Studio dashboards (e.g., "Shopping Insider Dashboard"). Click the "Share" button in the top right corner. In the "Share with people and groups" dialog, change the general access setting from "Restricted" to "Anyone with the link". Ensure the permission is set to "Viewer". Copy the generated shareable link.
    3. **Simulate Unauthorized Access:** Open a new private browsing window or use a different web browser where you are not logged into your Google account that has access to the Looker Studio dashboard or the Google Cloud project. Paste the copied shareable link into the address bar and press Enter.
    4. **Verify Unauthorized Data Access:** Observe if the Looker Studio dashboard loads successfully and if you can view the shopping ads performance data and feed health information. If you can access the dashboard and view the data without being logged in as an authorized user, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    5. **Remediation:** Go back to the Looker Studio dashboard (using your authorized account). Click the "Share" button again. Change the general access setting back to "Restricted". Ensure that only specific users or groups within your organization are granted access as viewers.
    6. **Re-test Access:** Repeat step 3 using the same shareable link (or obtain a new link if necessary after changing permissions). Verify that you are now prompted to request access or that the dashboard is no longer accessible without proper authorization. If you are denied access, the mitigation is confirmed.

This security test case demonstrates how a user's misconfiguration of Looker Studio sharing settings can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, validating the described vulnerability.
