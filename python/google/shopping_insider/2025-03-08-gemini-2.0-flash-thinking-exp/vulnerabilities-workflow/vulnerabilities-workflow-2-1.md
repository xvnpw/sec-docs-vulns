- vulnerability name: Unintentional Public Exposure of Sensitive Business Data via Looker Studio Dashboards
 - description: |
   1. The Shopping Insider project is designed to extract data from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads, process it using SQL in BigQuery, and visualize it through Looker Studio dashboards. This process inherently deals with sensitive business performance data.
   2. The final step in utilizing this project involves users creating and sharing Looker Studio dashboards to gain insights from the processed data.
   3. Looker Studio offers various sharing options, including public sharing ("Public on the web" or "Anyone with the link"). If users, even unintentionally, select these broader sharing options, the dashboards containing sensitive business data become accessible to a wider audience than intended.
   4. External threat actors, who could be competitors, malicious individuals, or simply unintended recipients of a shared link, can gain access to these publicly shared Looker Studio dashboards.
   5. Once accessed, these threat actors can view and potentially misuse sensitive business performance data, leading to competitive disadvantage, reputational damage, or other harms.
 - impact: |
   - Confidentiality breach: Sensitive business performance data from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads, including product performance, advertising costs, and market insights, becomes accessible to unauthorized individuals.
   - Reputational damage: Unintentional data exposure can damage the retailer's reputation and erode customer trust.
   - Competitive disadvantage: Competitors gaining access to business performance data can use it to their advantage.
   - Financial loss: In severe cases, exposure of sensitive financial or strategic data could lead to direct or indirect financial losses.
 - vulnerability rank: High
 - currently implemented mitigations: No specific code-level mitigations are implemented within the Shopping Insider project itself to prevent misconfiguration of Looker Studio sharing settings. The project's responsibility ends at setting up the data infrastructure. Looker Studio's default sharing settings are in place, which require users to explicitly choose sharing options.
 - missing mitigations: |
   - Security Hardening Documentation: The most critical missing mitigation is comprehensive documentation that explicitly warns users about the risks of unintentional public data exposure through Looker Studio dashboard sharing. This documentation should be prominently placed in the README file and installation guides, emphasizing best practices for secure sharing. The documentation should include:
     - Clear warnings about the risks associated with "Public on the web" and "Anyone with the link" sharing options in Looker Studio.
     - Recommendations to use restricted sharing options within Looker Studio, such as sharing only with "Specific people or groups" who are authorized to view the data.
     - Best practices for managing Looker Studio user permissions and data access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive dashboards.
     - Guidance on regularly auditing and reviewing Looker Studio sharing settings to detect and correct any misconfigurations.
 - preconditions: |
   - The Shopping Insider project must be successfully installed, and Looker Studio dashboards must be created by the user, utilizing the data sources set up by the project.
   - A user with edit access to a Looker Studio dashboard must intentionally or unintentionally misconfigure the dashboard's sharing settings, selecting a public option like "Public on the web" or "Anyone with the link can view".
   - A threat actor must discover the publicly accessible dashboard. This could happen through direct discovery if "Public on the web" is enabled (though less likely), or more realistically, through unintended sharing or leakage of an "Anyone with the link" URL.
 - source code analysis: |
   - The provided source code, consisting of shell scripts, Python scripts, SQL files, and configuration files, primarily focuses on automating the setup of data pipelines and infrastructure within Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
   - The code's functionality includes:
     - Enabling necessary Google Cloud APIs (`cloud_env_setup.py`, `plugins/cloud_utils/cloud_api.py`).
     - Creating BigQuery datasets and tables (`cloud_bigquery.py`).
     - Setting up data transfers from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads to BigQuery (`cloud_data_transfer.py`).
     - Defining SQL views and scheduled queries to process and materialize data in BigQuery (`cloud_bigquery.py`, SQL files in `/sql` directory).
   - **Absence of Looker Studio Integration Code:** Critically, there is **no source code within the provided project that directly manages or controls Looker Studio dashboard sharing settings.** Looker Studio is a separate Google product, and the sharing configurations are managed entirely within the Looker Studio interface by the user.
   - **Indirect Contribution to Vulnerability:** While the code itself doesn't contain the vulnerability, it is essential to recognize that the project *creates the data infrastructure* that is used to build Looker Studio dashboards. These dashboards, by design, are intended to visualize potentially sensitive business data extracted and processed by this project. Therefore, the project indirectly contributes to the risk if users are not adequately warned about secure sharing practices in Looker Studio.
   - **Configuration Files and Scripts:**  A review of `config.yaml`, `setup.sh`, `cloud_env_setup.py`, and other scripts shows no configurations related to Looker Studio sharing. These files manage GCP resources and data transfer setups, but do not extend to Looker Studio settings.
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** The `auth.py` and `plugins/cloud_utils/cloud_auth.py` files handle authentication and authorization for accessing Google Cloud services programmatically during setup (e.g., creating data transfers). This authentication is relevant for the *project's operation* but not for *Looker Studio dashboard access control*, which is managed separately by Looker Studio itself.
   - **Conclusion:** The vulnerability is not a flaw in the provided code. Instead, it is a *configuration vulnerability* arising from the user's potential misconfiguration of Looker Studio sharing settings when using the dashboards created based on the data infrastructure set up by this project. The source code analysis confirms that the project's scope is limited to data infrastructure setup and does not include direct management of Looker Studio sharing. The missing mitigation is therefore focused on documentation and user guidance rather than code changes.
 - security test case: |
   1. **Project Installation:** Install the Shopping Insider project in a Google Cloud Project, following the instructions in the `README.md`. Ensure that the installation completes successfully and that the BigQuery datasets and tables are created.
   2. **Looker Studio Dashboard Creation:** Access Looker Studio and create a new dashboard using the "Shopping Insider Dashboard Template" or "Merchant Market Insights Dashboard Template" (if Market Insights was enabled during installation) as mentioned in the `README.md`. Connect the data sources in the template to the BigQuery views created by the Shopping Insider project (e.g., `product_detailed_materialized`, `market_insights_snapshot_view`).
   3. **Dashboard Sharing Misconfiguration:** Open the newly created Looker Studio dashboard in edit mode. Click the "Share" button in the top right corner. In the "Share with people and groups" dialog, change the general access setting from "Restricted" to either:
      - "Anyone with the link" and select "Viewer". Click "Done".
      - "Public on the web" and select "Anyone on the internet can find and view". Click "Done".
   4. **External, Unauthenticated Access Attempt ("Anyone with the link" scenario):**
      - Copy the shareable link generated by Looker Studio (if "Anyone with the link" was chosen).
      - Open a new private browsing window or use a different browser where you are not logged into your Google account or any account with access to the GCP project or Looker Studio dashboard.
      - Paste the copied shareable link into the browser's address bar and press Enter.
      - **Verification:** Verify that you can successfully access and view the Looker Studio dashboard and all its reports and data visualizations without being prompted to log in or authenticate. Observe that you can see the business performance data derived from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.
   5. **External, Unauthenticated Access Attempt ("Public on the web" scenario):**
      - If "Public on the web" was chosen, attempt to find the dashboard through a search engine (though immediate indexing is unlikely, this tests the principle). A more direct test is to assume the dashboard URL is somehow known publicly.
      - Open a new private browsing window or use a different browser where you are not logged into your Google account.
      - Directly access the Looker Studio dashboard URL (you would need to know or simulate how an attacker might discover this URL if truly "Public on the web").
      - **Verification:** Verify that you can successfully access and view the Looker Studio dashboard and its data visualizations without authentication, similar to the "Anyone with the link" scenario.
   6. **Expected Outcome:** In both scenarios, the security test should demonstrate that by misconfiguring Looker Studio sharing settings, sensitive business performance data visualized in the dashboards becomes publicly accessible to external, unauthenticated threat actors. This confirms the vulnerability.
   7. **Remediation Test (Documentation Mitigation):** Implement the documentation mitigations described in "Missing Mitigations" by adding clear security warnings and best practices to the `README.md` and installation guides.  After updating the documentation, emphasize these warnings to users. Re-run steps 1-3, but this time, ensure that you share the dashboard using secure settings ("Specific people or groups"). Verify that external unauthenticated access is now prevented, and access is restricted to only authorized users, demonstrating the effectiveness of documentation-based mitigation in guiding users towards secure configurations.
