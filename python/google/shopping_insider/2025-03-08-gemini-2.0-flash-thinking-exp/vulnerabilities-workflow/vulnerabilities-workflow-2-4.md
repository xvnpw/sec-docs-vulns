- Vulnerability Name: OAuth Scope Abuse via Phished Installation Script/Sheet
- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a fake website or distribution channel mimicking the official Shopping Insider project.
    2. This fake channel hosts a modified version of the Shopping Insider installation methods: either a Cyborg Google Sheet or the `setup.sh` shell script.
    3. The attacker uses phishing techniques (e.g., emails, social media ads, look-alike domain names) to lure retailers to this fake channel.
    4. A retailer, believing they are using the legitimate Shopping Insider installation, initiates the installation process using the attacker's modified script or sheet.
    5. During the installation, the modified script/sheet prompts the retailer to authorize OAuth permissions, potentially requesting excessive scopes or misusing legitimate scopes.
    6. Upon successful OAuth authorization by the retailer, the attacker gains access to the retailer's Google Cloud project and potentially sensitive data from Google Merchant Center and Google Ads. This access is granted because the retailer unknowingly authorized the attacker's malicious application.
- Impact:
    - **Critical Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to retailer's Google Merchant Center and Google Ads data, including product catalogs, sales performance, customer data, and advertising strategies.
    - **Financial Loss:** Potential for unauthorized ad spending in Google Ads, manipulation of product listings in Merchant Center, or exfiltration of business-critical data for competitive advantage or resale.
    - **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and business reputation due to data security incident.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the project code itself. The project description includes a disclaimer stating it's not an officially supported Google product, which might be seen as a weak form of mitigation by warning users to be cautious, but it doesn't prevent the vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Code Signing/Integrity Checks:** Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of the installation script (`setup.sh`) and Cyborg Google Sheet template. This could involve:
        - Checksums or digital signatures for the `setup.sh` script, verified during download or execution.
        - Official distribution channels with verified links to the Cyborg Google Sheet template.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for OAuth Scopes:**  Ensure that the OAuth scopes requested by the installation process are strictly limited to the minimum permissions required for the solution to function. Regularly review and minimize requested scopes.
    - **Clear Security Warnings in Documentation:** Prominently display warnings in the `README.md` and installation guides about the risks of using unofficial or modified versions of the installation tools and the importance of using only trusted sources. Emphasize the need to verify the source of the installation script and Google Sheet template.
- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker must successfully create a convincing phishing campaign to redirect retailers to a malicious version of the Shopping Insider installation.
    2. The retailer must have a Google Cloud Project, Google Merchant Center, and Google Ads accounts and be willing to use the provided installation methods.
    3. The retailer must be tricked into authorizing OAuth permissions for the attacker's malicious script/sheet.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided code does not contain any specific vulnerability in the sense of code flaws like buffer overflows or injection vulnerabilities.
    - The vulnerability is architectural and lies in the project's installation process that relies on user execution of scripts and OAuth authorization, making it susceptible to phishing attacks.
    - **`README.md`**:  Clearly outlines two installation options, Cyborg Sheet and Shell Script, making them obvious targets for attackers to replicate and modify. The links to the Google Group and Cyborg Sheet, while legitimate, could be replaced in a phishing context with malicious ones.
    - **`setup.sh`**: This script is the primary installation entry point for users choosing the command-line method. A modified `setup.sh` could be designed to exfiltrate OAuth tokens or perform malicious actions after authorization.
    - **`cloud_env_setup.py` and `auth.py`**: These scripts handle the core logic of enabling APIs, setting up data transfers, and OAuth authorization.  A compromised version of these scripts could be used to grant attacker-controlled services access or steal credentials.
    - **OAuth Flow (Implicit in the design):** The project relies on OAuth to authorize data transfers and scheduled queries.  The inherent risk is that if a user is phished into authorizing a malicious client, that client can gain access within the authorized scopes.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Set up a Phishing Environment:**
        - Create a fake website that looks very similar to the legitimate Shopping Insider project page or a common retailer support portal.
        - Host a modified `setup.sh` script on this fake website. This script should, in addition to the legitimate installation steps, attempt to exfiltrate the OAuth token obtained during authorization (e.g., by sending it to an attacker-controlled server) or create a backdoor user in the GCP project.
    2. **Phishing Attack:**
        - Send a phishing email to a target retailer (or simulate this scenario). The email should:
            - Mimic a legitimate communication (e.g., from Google or a retail industry organization).
            - Urge the retailer to install "Shopping Insider" for enhanced shopping data analysis.
            - Link to the fake website hosting the malicious `setup.sh` script.
    3. **Retailer Interaction (Simulated):**
        - Assume the retailer clicks the link and downloads the `setup.sh` script from the fake website.
        - The retailer executes the script, providing their GCP project ID, Merchant Center ID, and Ads Customer ID as prompted.
        - The script initiates the OAuth authorization flow as designed in the original project.
        - The retailer, not realizing they are on a fake site and using a malicious script, completes the OAuth authorization process, granting permissions.
    4. **Verify Exploit:**
        - Check if the attacker successfully received the OAuth token (if the malicious script was designed to exfiltrate it).
        - Check if the attacker gained unauthorized access to the retailer's Google Cloud project or data using the phished OAuth token or any backdoors created by the malicious script. For example, try to access BigQuery datasets created by the legitimate Shopping Insider or attempt to run queries against the retailer's data.
