### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Video File in Dataset Processing

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious video file. This video file is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the video processing pipeline used to create HyperNeRF datasets.
    2. The attacker uses the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook, linked in the project README, and provides the malicious video file as input for dataset creation.
    3. The Colab notebook, during the video processing step, decodes and processes the malicious video file.
    4. Due to the malicious nature of the video file, a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, format string bug, or other parsing vulnerability) is triggered in the video processing library or custom code used in the notebook.
    5. This vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution on the Colab environment, under the context of the Colab runtime.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution. The attacker can gain complete control over the Colab environment. This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data within the Colab environment (including potentially uploaded datasets, credentials, or other Colab notebooks) could be stolen.
        - Resource hijacking: Colab resources (CPU, GPU, memory) could be used for malicious activities like cryptomining or further attacks.
        - Supply chain compromise: If the Colab environment is used for development or deployment pipelines, the attacker might be able to inject malicious code into the project or its dependencies.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: Based on the provided files, there are no specific mitigations implemented in the core HyperNeRF code to prevent vulnerabilities during external video file processing. The provided files focus on model training and evaluation, not dataset creation or input validation of video files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for video files during the dataset creation process. This should include:
        - File format validation: Verify that the uploaded file is indeed a video file of the expected type.
        - Deep inspection: Analyze the video file structure and metadata to detect potentially malicious or malformed content.
        - Safe decoding libraries: Utilize well-maintained and security-audited video decoding libraries, ensuring they are up-to-date with security patches.
        - Sandboxing/Isolation: Process video files in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    - **Error Handling and Resource Limits**: Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage unexpected video file formats or corrupted files. Set resource limits (e.g., memory, processing time) during video processing to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs access to the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook. This notebook is publicly linked in the project's README.md.
    2. The attacker needs to be able to upload or provide a video file to the Colab notebook for processing.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided PROJECT FILES do not contain the source code of the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook. Therefore, a direct source code analysis of the vulnerable code is not possible from these files alone.
    - However, based on the project description and the presence of dataset loading scripts (e.g., in `/code/hypernerf/datasets/nerfies.py` and `/code/hypernerf/datasets/core.py`), it can be inferred that the Colab notebook likely uses some form of video decoding and processing to extract frames and camera poses for dataset creation.
    - Vulnerabilities could arise in:
        - **Video decoding libraries**: If the notebook uses libraries with known vulnerabilities or outdated versions for video decoding (e.g., OpenCV, ffmpeg bindings, or similar).
        - **Custom video processing code**: If the notebook contains custom code to parse video file formats or extract data, vulnerabilities could be present due to improper input handling or parsing logic.
        - **File handling**: If temporary files are created and handled insecurely during video processing, this could also lead to vulnerabilities.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Access the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook linked in the HyperNeRF repository README.
    2. **Craft Malicious Video**: Create a specially crafted video file. This could involve:
        - Using known exploits for common video codecs or container formats.
        - Creating malformed video headers or metadata designed to trigger parsing errors.
        - Embedding executable code within video metadata or data streams (depending on the vulnerability being targeted).
        *(Note: Creating a precise malicious video file requires deep knowledge of video processing vulnerabilities and is beyond the scope of this document. For testing, one could start by trying known sample exploit videos or fuzzing the video processing pipeline).*
    3. **Upload/Provide Malicious Video**: In the Colab notebook, follow the instructions to process a video into a dataset. When prompted to provide a video file, upload or provide the crafted malicious video file.
    4. **Execute Dataset Processing**: Run the cell in the Colab notebook that initiates the video processing and dataset creation.
    5. **Verify Code Execution**: Monitor the Colab environment for signs of arbitrary code execution. This could involve:
        - Checking for unexpected files created in the Colab filesystem.
        - Monitoring network activity for unauthorized connections originating from the Colab environment.
        - Observing abnormal Colab runtime behavior (e.g., crashes, unexpected outputs, resource spikes).
        - As a simple proof of concept, attempt to execute a command within the Colab notebook to write a file to the filesystem after providing the malicious video, to see if the file is created, indicating code execution beyond the intended scope.
