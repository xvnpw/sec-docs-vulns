## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities within the HyperNeRF project. Each vulnerability is detailed below, including its description, potential impact, severity ranking, current mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal in Dataset Loading

*   **Description:**
    1.  The HyperNeRF project utilizes dataset paths supplied through command-line arguments, specifically via Gin bindings like `--gin_bindings="data_dir='$DATASET_PATH'"`.
    2.  The `eval.py` and `train.py` scripts subsequently employ these paths to load datasets for processing.
    3.  If a threat actor can manipulate the `DATASET_PATH` or craft files within the dataset to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`), the application may be tricked into accessing files or directories outside the intended dataset directory.
    4.  By providing a maliciously crafted dataset path, an attacker could potentially read sensitive files or even write to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, depending on how the dataset paths are handled in the codebase.

*   **Impact:**
    - **High:** Unauthorized File Access. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the server by crafting a dataset that leverages path traversal to access files beyond the designated dataset directory. Depending on the application's file system permissions, it might also be possible to overwrite files or potentially achieve code execution if write access is granted in the traversed path.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None are currently implemented. The code in `eval.py` and `train.py` directly uses the `DATASET_PATH` without any input validation or sanitization.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all file paths, especially those derived from user inputs or external sources like datasets. This should include:
        - Verifying that the provided `DATASET_PATH` is confined within expected boundaries.
        - Sanitizing file paths within datasets to neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
        - Employing secure file path handling functions to prevent traversal, such as ensuring paths are absolute and within a defined safe directory.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to influence or provide the dataset utilized by the HyperNeRF training or evaluation scripts. In a real-world attack scenario, this could involve:
        - Social engineering a user into training or evaluating the model using a dataset controlled by the attacker.
        - Exploiting scenarios where the application processes datasets from external, potentially untrusted sources.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **`eval.py` and `train.py`:**
        - Both scripts define flags using `flags.DEFINE_string('base_folder', None, 'where to store ckpts and logs')` and `flags.DEFINE_multi_string('gin_bindings', None, 'Gin parameter bindings.')`.
        - The `DATASET_PATH` is passed via Gin bindings: `--gin_bindings="data_dir='$DATASET_PATH'"`.
        - The scripts then use `exp_config.datasource_cls(data_dir='$DATASET_PATH', ...)` to instantiate the datasource.

        ```python
        # File: /code/eval.py and /code/train.py
        flags.DEFINE_string('base_folder', None, 'where to store ckpts and logs')
        flags.mark_flag_as_required('base_folder')
        flags.DEFINE_multi_string('gin_bindings', None, 'Gin parameter bindings.')
        flags.DEFINE_multi_string('gin_configs', (), 'Gin config files.')
        FLAGS = flags.FLAGS

        ...

        gin.parse_config_files_and_bindings(
            config_files=gin_configs,
            bindings=FLAGS.gin_bindings,
            skip_unknown=True)

        ...

        datasource = exp_config.datasource_cls(
            image_scale=exp_config.image_scale,
            random_seed=exp_config.random_seed,
            data_dir=FLAGS.DATASET_PATH, # DATASET_PATH comes from gin binding
            ...
        )
        ```

    2.  **`configs.py`:**
        - `ExperimentConfig` defines `datasource_cls: Callable[..., datasets.DataSource] = gin.REQUIRED`, indicating that the datasource class is configurable via Gin.

        ```python
        # File: /code/hypernerf/configs.py
        @gin.configurable()
        @dataclasses.dataclass
        class ExperimentConfig:
          """Experiment configuration."""
          ...
          # The datasource class.
          datasource_cls: Callable[..., datasets.DataSource] = gin.REQUIRED
        ```

    3.  **`hypernerf/datasets/nerfies.py` (and similar datasource files):**
        - Datasource classes, such as `NerfiesDataSource`, receive `data_dir` as an argument in their `__init__` method.
        - Inside the datasource, `data_dir` is used to construct file paths for loading RGB images, depth images, and camera parameters.

        ```python
        # File: /code/hypernerf/datasets/nerfies.py
        @gin.configurable
        class NerfiesDataSource(core.DataSource):
          """Data loader for videos."""

          def __init__(self,
                       data_dir: str = gin.REQUIRED, # data_dir is passed here
                       image_scale: int = gin.REQUIRED,
                       shuffle_pixels: bool = False,
                       camera_type: str = 'json',
                       test_camera_trajectory: str = 'orbit-mild',
                       **kwargs):
            self.data_dir = gpath.GPath(data_dir) # Used to create GPath objects
            ...
            self.rgb_dir = gpath.GPath(data_dir, 'rgb', f'{image_scale}x') # Path construction
            self.depth_dir = gpath.GPath(data_dir, 'depth', f'{image_scale}x') # Path construction
            self.camera_dir = gpath.GPath(data_dir, 'camera') # Path construction
            ...

          def get_rgb_path(self, item_id: str) -> types.PathType:
            return self.rgb_dir / f'{item_id}.png' # Path construction

          def load_rgb(self, item_id: str) -> np.ndarray:
            return _load_image(self.rgb_dir / f'{item_id}.png') # Path construction and file open

          def load_camera(self, ...):
            if self.camera_type == 'proto':
              camera_path = self.camera_dir / f'{item_id}{self.camera_ext}' # Path construction
            elif self.camera_type == 'json':
              camera_path = self.camera_dir / f'{item_id}{self.camera_ext}' # Path construction
            ...
            return core.load_camera(camera_path, ...) # File open inside load_camera

        ```

        - The use of `gpath.GPath` does not inherently prevent path traversal if the base path (`data_dir`) or subsequent path components are attacker-controlled or derived from attacker-controlled data without proper validation.

*   **Security Test Case:**

    1.  **Prepare a Malicious Dataset Path:**
        - Create a directory named `malicious_dataset`.
        - Inside `malicious_dataset`, create a subdirectory named `rgb/4x`.
        - In `rgb/4x`, create a file named `test_image.png` (can be a dummy image).
        - Create a symbolic link named `../../../../tmp/evil_file.txt` inside `rgb/4x`. This link points to `/tmp/evil_file.txt` outside the dataset directory, simulating path traversal.
        - Create an empty file named `dataset.json` in `malicious_dataset` or use a valid `dataset.json` and modify it if needed.
        - Create an empty directory named `camera` inside `malicious_dataset`.

    2.  **Set up HyperNeRF Evaluation:**
        - Ensure HyperNeRF environment is set up as per `README.md`.
        - Locate or create a configuration file (e.g., `configs/test_local.gin`) for evaluation.
        - Modify the evaluation command to use the malicious dataset path:

        ```bash
        export DATASET_PATH=/home/user/attacker_controlled_dataset # Path to malicious_dataset
        export EXPERIMENT_PATH=/tmp/hypernerf_experiment # Or any experiment path
        python eval.py \
            --base_folder $EXPERIMENT_PATH \
            --gin_bindings="data_dir='$DATASET_PATH'" \
            --gin_configs configs/test_local.gin
        ```

    3.  **Run Evaluation and Observe File Access:**
        - Execute the modified `eval.py` command.
        - Monitor file system access using tools like `strace` or `fs_usage`.
        - Look for attempts to open `/tmp/evil_file.txt` or any file outside `malicious_dataset`, indicating path traversal.

    4.  **Expected Outcome:**
        - If vulnerable, the script will attempt to access `/tmp/evil_file.txt` during dataset loading, confirming path traversal.
        - With mitigations, the script should either fail or only access files within `malicious_dataset`.

### Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Image File in Dataset

*   **Description:**
    1.  The `_load_image` function in `/code/hypernerf/datasets/nerfies.py` and `/code/hypernerf/datasets/interp.py` employs `cv2.imdecode` to decode image files.
    2.  `cv2.imdecode` is known to be susceptible to vulnerabilities when processing maliciously crafted image files across various image formats.
    3.  By including a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) within a training dataset, an attacker can potentially trigger a vulnerability in `cv2.imdecode`.
    4.  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine during the training script's dataset loading and image processing phase.

*   **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine of the user training the HyperNeRF model. This grants the attacker full control over the user's system, enabling data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly utilizes `cv2.imdecode` without any input validation or sanitization of the loaded image files.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation:** Implement checks to validate the integrity and safety of image files before using `cv2.imdecode`. This could include file format validation, size limits, and security scanning.
    - **Secure image decoding library:** Consider using safer image decoding libraries or sandboxing `cv2.imdecode` to limit exploit impact.
    - **Dataset sanitization:** Provide tools/scripts to sanitize datasets, removing potentially malicious files before user training.
    - **Documentation:** Warn users about risks of untrusted datasets and recommend dataset security best practices.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The user must download and use a maliciously crafted dataset from an attacker.
    2.  The user must execute `train.py` or `eval.py` using this malicious dataset.
    3.  The malicious dataset must contain an image file crafted to exploit `cv2.imdecode`.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  File: `/code/hypernerf/datasets/nerfies.py` (and `/code/hypernerf/datasets/interp.py`)
    2.  Function: `_load_image(path: types.PathType)`
    ```python
    def _load_image(path: types.PathType) -> np.ndarray:
      path = gpath.GPath(path)
      with path.open('rb') as f:
        raw_im = np.asarray(bytearray(f.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
        image = cv2.imdecode(raw_im, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)[:, :, ::-1]  # BGR -> RGB
        image = np.asarray(image).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
        return image
    ```
    3.  The code reads the image file at `path` into `raw_im` as bytes.
    4.  `cv2.imdecode(raw_im, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)` decodes the image from bytes.
    5.  A malicious image can exploit vulnerabilities in `cv2.imdecode` leading to arbitrary code execution.
    6.  The decoded image is converted to a NumPy array and normalized.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Preparation**:
        a. Create a malicious PNG image (`malicious.png`) exploiting a `cv2.imdecode` vulnerability (or a hypothetical one for testing). Fuzzing `cv2.imdecode` can help identify crashes.
        b. Create a minimal HyperNeRF dataset structure with `dataset.json`, `scene.json`, `camera` directory (dummy files), and `rgb/4x` directory.
        c. Place `malicious.png` in `rgb/4x` as `000.png`.
        d. Update `dataset.json` to include `"000"` as a train ID, referencing the malicious image.

    2.  **Execution**:
        a. Set up HyperNeRF environment.
        b. Set `DATASET_PATH` to the malicious dataset path.
        c. Run `python train.py --base_folder /tmp/hypernerf_test --gin_configs configs/test_local.gin --gin_bindings="data_dir='$DATASET_PATH'"`.

    3.  **Verification**:
        a. Monitor training script execution.
        b. Successful exploit leads to arbitrary code execution:
            - Script crash.
            - Attacker code execution (file modifications, network connections, observable side effects).
        c. Crash or arbitrary code execution confirms the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability 3: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Video File in Dataset Processing

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious video file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in video processing during HyperNeRF dataset creation.
    2. The attacker uses the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook (linked in README) and provides the malicious video as input.
    3. The Colab notebook decodes and processes the video.
    4. A vulnerability (buffer overflow, format string bug, parsing vulnerability) is triggered in the video processing library or custom code.
    5. This leads to arbitrary code execution in the Colab environment.

*   **Impact:**
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution. Full control over the Colab environment, leading to:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data in Colab.
        - Resource hijacking: Using Colab resources for malicious activities.
        - Supply chain compromise: Injecting malicious code into development pipelines if Colab is used for development.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None**: No mitigations in core HyperNeRF code to prevent video processing vulnerabilities during dataset creation. The provided files are for training/evaluation, not dataset creation.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust validation for video files during dataset creation:
        - File format validation.
        - Deep inspection for malicious content.
        - Safe decoding libraries (up-to-date and security-audited).
        - Sandboxing/Isolation for video processing.
    - **Error Handling and Resource Limits**: Implement error handling for unexpected video formats and resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1. Access to the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook (publicly linked).
    2. Ability to upload/provide a video file to the Colab notebook.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The Colab notebook code is not in provided PROJECT FILES. Analysis is based on inference.
    - The notebook likely uses video decoding to extract frames and camera poses for dataset creation.
    - Vulnerabilities could be in:
        - **Video decoding libraries**: Vulnerable or outdated libraries (OpenCV, ffmpeg bindings).
        - **Custom video processing code**: Improper input handling or parsing logic in custom code.
        - **File handling**: Insecure temporary file handling during processing.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup**: Access the "Process a video into a dataset" Colab notebook.
    2. **Craft Malicious Video**: Create a crafted video file using known exploits, malformed headers, or embedded executable code. (Requires video processing vulnerability expertise). Start by trying known exploit videos or fuzzing.
    3. **Upload/Provide Malicious Video**: Provide the crafted video to the Colab notebook for processing.
    4. **Execute Dataset Processing**: Run the notebook cell to start video processing.
    5. **Verify Code Execution**: Monitor Colab for arbitrary code execution:
        - Unexpected files.
        - Unauthorized network activity.
        - Abnormal runtime behavior.
        - PoC: Try to write a file after providing the malicious video to check for code execution.
