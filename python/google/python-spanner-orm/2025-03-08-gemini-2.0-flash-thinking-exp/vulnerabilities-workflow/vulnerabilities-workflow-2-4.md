- Vulnerability Name: Misuse of ArbitraryCondition for SQL Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker can potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating user inputs if `ArbitraryCondition` is used insecurely.
    2. This vulnerability occurs when developers construct SQL queries using `ArbitraryCondition` and directly embed unsanitized user-provided input into the `sql_template` argument.
    3. Instead of using parameterized queries with `Param` for user inputs, developers might mistakenly concatenate user input strings directly into the SQL template.
    4. For example, if user input is used to construct a filter condition within `ArbitraryCondition`'s `sql_template` without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject SQL code to bypass intended filters or access unauthorized data.
    5. This could be exploited through application endpoints that allow users to influence query construction and utilize `ArbitraryCondition`.
- Impact:
    - Data Leakage: Attackers could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries to bypass intended data access restrictions.
    - Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers might gain unauthorized access to data they are not supposed to view or modify, potentially leading to data breaches or data integrity issues.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No specific code-level mitigations are implemented within the `spanner-orm` library to prevent the misuse of `ArbitraryCondition`.
    - The documentation implicitly suggests using parameters, but it does not explicitly warn against the dangers of direct string concatenation in `ArbitraryCondition` or provide specific guidelines on secure usage.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicit documentation warning against the insecure use of `ArbitraryCondition` and detailing best practices for secure query construction, emphasizing parameterization with `Param`.
    - Consider providing safer, higher-level abstractions for common use cases that might tempt developers to use `ArbitraryCondition` insecurely.
    - Static analysis or linting tools to detect potential insecure uses of `ArbitraryCondition` could be beneficial, although challenging to implement effectively.
- Preconditions:
    - The application code must utilize `ArbitraryCondition` to construct database queries.
    - User-controlled input must be incorporated into the `sql_template` of `ArbitraryCondition` without proper sanitization or parameterization using `Param`.
    - The application must be accessible to external attackers, or internal users must have the ability to manipulate query parameters.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/spanner_orm/condition.py`
    - Class: `ArbitraryCondition`
    - The `ArbitraryCondition` class is designed to allow developers to create custom SQL snippets.
    - The `__init__` method takes `sql_template` as an argument, which is a string that can contain placeholders for substitutions.
    - The `_sql` method substitutes values into the `sql_template`.
    - Vulnerability arises if `sql_template` is built using unsanitized user inputs. For example:
    ```python
    user_input_filter = input("Enter filter condition: ")  # User input
    arbitrary_condition = spanner_orm.ArbitraryCondition(
        sql_template="value_1 = '" + user_input_filter + "'", # Insecure direct concatenation
        segment=spanner_orm.condition.Segment.WHERE
    )
    models.SmallTestModel.where(arbitrary_condition)
    ```
    - In this insecure example, a malicious user could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the intended filter.
    - The `ArbitraryCondition` itself doesn't enforce secure usage; the security relies on the developer's correct implementation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Define a model, e.g., `VulnerableModel` with a `value` field.
        - Create an endpoint in a test application that uses `spanner-orm` to query `VulnerableModel` based on a filter provided by the user via HTTP GET parameter named `filter_param`.
        - The query should be constructed using `ArbitraryCondition` and **insecurely** concatenate the `filter_param` value into the `sql_template` without using `Param`.
    2. Attack:
        - An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `filter_param`. For example: `/?filter_param='; DELETE FROM VulnerableModel; --`
    3. Expected Result:
        - If vulnerable: The injected SQL code executes against the Spanner database. In this example, it would attempt to delete all rows from `VulnerableModel` table (depending on permissions and emulator behaviour).
        - If mitigated (no mitigation exists in code, so this will be vulnerable): The application proceeds with executing the malicious SQL query.
    4. Pass/Fail Criteria:
        - Fail: The test passes if the injected SQL code is executed, demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability (e.g., data is deleted unexpectedly or an error indicating SQL parsing failure due to injection is observed).
        - Pass: The test fails if the injected SQL code is not executed as intended (this scenario is not expected given the described vulnerability).
