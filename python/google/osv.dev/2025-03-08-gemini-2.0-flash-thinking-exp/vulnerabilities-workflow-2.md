### Vulnerability List for OSV Project

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure gRPC Endpoint Configuration for Testing

* Description:
  - The file `/code/gcp/api/v1/README.md` and `/code/gcp/api/v1/api_config_test.yaml` describe the deployment of a Cloud Endpoints service for integration tests at `api-test.osv.dev`.
  - The `api_config_test.yaml` configuration file, used to deploy the test endpoints configuration, explicitly sets `allow_unregistered_calls: true` under `usage rules`.
  - This configuration bypasses authentication and authorization checks for all methods on the test API endpoint.
  - An attacker could potentially exploit this by sending malicious requests to the test endpoint, bypassing intended security measures.

* Impact:
  - Unauthorized access to the test API endpoint.
  - Potential manipulation of vulnerability data within the testing environment.
  - Risk of data leaks from the test environment if malicious requests are crafted to extract data.
  - Although this is a test endpoint, vulnerabilities here can lead to confusion and potentially affect the perceived security posture of the overall OSV project.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The vulnerability is limited to the test API endpoint `api-test.osv.dev`, and does not affect the production API `api.osv.dev`.
  - The configuration is intended for integration tests within the `oss-vdb` project, and is not meant for production use.

* Missing Mitigations:
  - Remove `allow_unregistered_calls: true` from `api_config_test.yaml` to enforce authentication even for testing endpoints.
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for the test API endpoint to mirror production security measures as closely as possible.
  - Regularly review and audit the security configurations of test and development environments to prevent unintentional exposure.

* Preconditions:
  - Access to the URL of the test API endpoint (`api-test.osv.dev`).
  - No authentication is required to access the test API endpoint due to insecure configuration.

* Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/gcp/api/v1/api_config_test.yaml`
  - ```yaml
    type: google.api.Service
    config_version: 3
    name: api-test.osv.dev
    title: OSV
    apis:
      - name: osv.v1.OSV
    usage:
      rules:
        - selector: "*"
          allow_unregistered_calls: true  # Vulnerability: Unprotected access
    backend:
      rules:
        - selector: "*"
          deadline: 120
    ```
  - The `allow_unregistered_calls: true` setting in `api_config_test.yaml` disables Cloud Endpoints authentication and authorization checks for all API methods defined in `osv_service_v1.proto`.
  - This means any request sent to `api-test.osv.dev` will bypass security checks and be directly processed by the backend server, regardless of the requester's identity or permissions.

* Security Test Case:
  1. Identify the test API endpoint URL: `api-test.osv.dev`.
  2. Craft a malicious API request. For example, use `curl` to query for vulnerabilities with an unexpected or malicious parameter:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"package": {"name": "test", "ecosystem": "PyPI"}, "version": "1.0.0"}' https://api-test.osv.dev/v1/query
     ```
  3. Observe the response. The vulnerability is confirmed if the request is successfully processed and returns a valid response (even if it's an empty vulnerability list), indicating that the request bypassed authentication and authorization.
  4. To further validate, attempt to access a non-query endpoint (if any existed in test API that is not supposed to be publicly accessible) and confirm that it's also accessible without any authentication.

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Blog Posts

* Description:
  - The OSV blog allows users to write blog posts in Markdown, which are then rendered into HTML using Hugo. If a blog post author includes malicious JavaScript code within their Markdown content, it could be executed when other users view the blog post.
  - Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. As a blog post author, create a new blog post or edit an existing one.
    2. In the Markdown content, insert malicious JavaScript code. For example:
       ```markdown
       <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
       ```
    3. Save and publish the blog post.
    4. As another user, view the blog post. The malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.

* Impact:
  - Successful XSS attacks can have a wide range of impacts, including:
    - **Account Hijacking:** Attacker can steal session cookies or credentials, leading to account takeover.
    - **Data Theft:** Sensitive information from the victim's browser or the viewed page can be exfiltrated.
    - **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the victim to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
    - **Defacement:** The website's appearance can be altered to mislead or defame.
    - **Redirection:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites or other malicious content.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Hugo is used to render Markdown to HTML, which generally provides some level of protection against XSS by escaping unsafe HTML.
  - Jinja2 templating engine likely auto-escapes variables by default, but this needs to be verified for blog rendering.

* Missing Mitigations:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are not explicitly mentioned in the provided files, which could further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load.
  - Explicit sanitization of blog post content before rendering to HTML, even if Hugo is considered safe, to provide defense in depth.

* Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to create or edit blog posts. In this project, blog posts are located in `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/`.  The contributing guide mentions blog posts are written using Markdown and rendered into HTML during deploy. The preconditions depend on the blog post submission workflow, which isn't fully detailed but seems to involve committing Markdown files to the repository. If contributors with malicious intent can commit blog posts, this vulnerability is exploitable.

* Source Code Analysis:
  - 1. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/welcome-to-the-osv-blog.md` and other blog post files**: Blog posts are written in Markdown format within the `content/posts/` directory.
  - 2. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/README.md`**: Mentions that "Posts are written using Markdown. During deploy, this is rendered into HTML. The blog is rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)."
  - 3. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/archetypes/default.md`**: Archetype for new blog posts, using Markdown.
  - 4. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/welcome-to-the-osv-blog.md`**: Example blog post in Markdown.
  - 5. **File: `/code/gcp/website/Dockerfile`**: Dockerfile for the website, includes Hugo build step: `RUN hugo --buildFuture -d ../dist/static/blog`. This confirms Hugo is used for rendering.
  - 6. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/posts-with-images.md`**: Shows how images are included in blog posts using Markdown format `![Alt text for screen readers.](image-name.png "This text appears when the mouse hovers over the image.")`. This indicates Markdown content is directly rendered.
  - 7. **File: `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/using-the-determineversion-api.md`**: Another example blog post.
  - 8. **File: `/code/docs/contributing/index.md`**: Documentation on contributing to blog posts, mentions previewing changes by spinning up a GitHub page for the fork.
  - 9. **File: `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Contributing guide, mentions Hugo installation prerequisites.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Markdown Blog Post (e.g., welcome-to-the-osv-blog.md)
        --> Hugo (rendering engine, see /code/gcp/website/blog/README.md & /code/gcp/website/Dockerfile)
            --> HTML Blog Post (rendered output)
                --> Web UI (displays HTML blog post, /code/gcp/website & /frontend3)
                    --> Potential XSS if malicious Markdown in blog post
    ```

    **Source Code Analysis Conclusion:**
    The source code confirms that blog posts are written in Markdown and rendered using Hugo. While Hugo is designed to mitigate XSS, improper configuration or vulnerabilities in Hugo itself could lead to XSS. Direct inclusion of `<script>` tags in Markdown is a common XSS attack vector, and the project doesn't explicitly describe sanitizing or filtering blog post content beyond Hugo's default rendering.

* Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
       - Access to create a pull request to the osv.dev repository or a local development environment where you can build and run the website.
       - Hugo installed and configured as per the contributing guide to test locally.

    2. **Steps:**
       - Fork the osv.dev repository.
       - Navigate to the blog posts directory: `/code/gcp/website/blog/content/posts/`.
       - Create a new Markdown file (e.g., `xss-test.md`) or edit an existing one (if you have write access or in your fork).
       - Add the following Markdown content to the file:
         ```markdown
         ---
         title: "XSS Test Post"
         date: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
         draft: false
         author: XSS Tester
         ---
         This is a test blog post to demonstrate a potential XSS vulnerability.

         <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>

         <p>This is the rest of the blog post content.</p>
         ```
       - If testing locally:
         - Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to run the local UI.
         - Navigate to the blog section of the local UI (usually http://localhost:8000/blog/).
         - Locate and view the "XSS Test Post".
         - Observe if the JavaScript `alert("XSS Vulnerability");` is executed when viewing the blog post. If an alert box pops up, the XSS vulnerability is present.
       - If creating a Pull Request:
         - Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
         - Create a pull request to the main osv.dev repository.
         - Before merging, preview the changes using the GitHub pages preview link for your fork (as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
         - Navigate to the blog section in the GitHub pages preview.
         - Locate and view the "XSS Test Post".
         - Observe if the JavaScript `alert("XSS Vulnerability");` is executed when viewing the blog post in the preview.

    3. **Expected Result:**
       - An alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" should pop up when viewing the blog post, demonstrating that the JavaScript code embedded in the Markdown was executed by the browser.

    4. **Note:**
       - If the alert box does not appear, it could indicate that Hugo is properly sanitizing the `<script>` tag, or that the test environment is not set up correctly. Double-check the setup and content if the alert doesn't appear.
