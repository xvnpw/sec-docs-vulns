====================================================================================================

- Vulnerability Name: Man-in-the-Middle Attack during Model Download
- Description:
  - A user initiates the LLVM build process using CMake.
  - The user sets the CMake flag `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` to instruct CMake to automatically download the inliner model.
  - CMake attempts to download the latest compatible inlining model from GitHub releases over HTTP.
  - An attacker positioned in the network path between the user's machine and GitHub can intercept the HTTP request for the model.
  - The attacker injects a malicious machine learning model into the network traffic, replacing the legitimate model in transit.
  - CMake, upon receiving the response, unknowingly downloads and uses the malicious model, as it lacks integrity verification.
  - The LLVM build process completes, incorporating the attacker-supplied malicious model into the compiler.
  - When the user compiles code with this compromised LLVM compiler, the malicious model guides inlining decisions, potentially leading to unexpected or harmful compiler behavior.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the LLVM compiler's inlining optimization process.
  - By substituting a malicious model, the attacker gains control over how the compiler inlines code.
  - This could result in:
    - Introduction of security vulnerabilities in software compiled with the compromised compiler.
    - Performance degradation of compiled binaries due to suboptimal inlining decisions dictated by the malicious model.
    - Unexpected and potentially harmful behavior of the compiler itself, leading to build failures or miscompilations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The project does not implement any security measures to protect the model download process. The README documentation only describes the download functionality without mentioning any mitigations.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Enforce HTTPS for Model Download:** The project should use HTTPS instead of HTTP for downloading the model from GitHub releases. HTTPS provides encryption and ensures communication integrity, making MITM attacks significantly harder to execute.
  - **Implement Model Integrity Verification:**  The project should implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded model. This could involve:
    - **Checksum Verification:**  Distributing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the legitimate models alongside the download instructions. CMake could then verify the downloaded model against the provided checksum.
    - **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally signing the model files using a private key controlled by the project maintainers. CMake could then verify the signature using the corresponding public key, ensuring the model's authenticity and integrity.
- Preconditions:
  - **User Action:** The user must explicitly configure CMake to download the inliner model by setting `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download`.
  - **Network Condition:** The attacker must be positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection between the user's machine and the GitHub releases server.
  - **Vulnerable Network:** The network connection must be susceptible to MITM attacks, typically due to the use of unencrypted HTTP for downloads.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability is documented in `/code/README.md` file, under the section "Pretrained models":
    -  "When building LLVM, there is a flag `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH` which you may set to the path to your inlining model. If the path is set to `download`, then cmake will download the most recent (compatible) model from github to use."
  - The `README.md` file indicates that the CMake build process with `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` triggers a model download from GitHub.
  - The provided documentation does not describe any code snippets related to the download process itself, but the description is sufficient to identify the vulnerability.
  - It is inferred that the CMake configuration or associated scripts are responsible for initiating an HTTP download from GitHub releases when the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` flag is set.
  - Without examining the CMake scripts, it is impossible to confirm the exact code responsible for the download. However, the vulnerability description in `README.md` clearly outlines the attack vector.
- Security Test Case:
  - **Environment Setup:**
    - Set up a local network environment where you can intercept HTTP traffic (e.g., using a tool like `mitmproxy` or `Wireshark` and `iptables` or similar network manipulation tools).
    - Configure a proxy server (e.g., `mitmproxy`) to intercept HTTP requests and responses.
  - **LLVM Build Configuration:**
    - On a test machine within the controlled network, prepare a build environment for LLVM.
    - Configure CMake for LLVM build, specifically including the flag `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download`.
  - **MITM Attack Simulation:**
    - Configure the proxy server to intercept requests to GitHub releases for the inliner model.
    - Prepare a malicious machine learning model file to replace the legitimate model.
    - Configure the proxy server to replace the legitimate model file in the HTTP response with the prepared malicious model file.
  - **Verification:**
    - Initiate the CMake configuration process on the test machine.
    - Observe the network traffic to confirm that the model is being downloaded over HTTP and that the proxy server is intercepting the traffic.
    - After the CMake configuration completes, examine the LLVM build directory to verify that the malicious model file is present instead of the legitimate one. You could compare file hashes or sizes if you have access to the legitimate model.
    - Compile a simple test program using the newly built LLVM compiler.
    - Analyze the assembly or binary output of the compiled program to verify that the inlining decisions are influenced by the malicious model. This might require comparing the output with a build using a legitimate model or the default inliner.

====================================================================================================

- Vulnerability name: Malicious Pre-trained Model Distribution
- Description:
  - An attacker could compromise the pre-trained model release process on the ml-compiler-opt GitHub repository.
  - By gaining control over the release mechanism, the attacker can upload a malicious pre-trained model, disguised as a legitimate release.
  - Unsuspecting users, when configuring LLVM with the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` option, will automatically download this malicious model during the CMake configuration process.
  - This happens because CMake is configured to fetch the "most recent compatible model from github" without any integrity checks.
  - Subsequently, when users compile software using this compromised LLVM build, the malicious model could be used to guide compiler optimizations, potentially introducing subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors into the compiled software.
- Impact:
  - **Critical**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the distribution of malicious pre-trained models to a wide range of LLVM users.
  - This could result in widespread introduction of subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors in software compiled using LLVM with the compromised model.
  - The impact is severe as it directly undermines the security of software compiled using LLVM, potentially affecting numerous downstream users and systems.
- Vulnerability rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - **Semantic Versioning**: The project uses semantic versioning for model releases. Major version bumps indicate breaking changes on the LLVM/compiler side, which could signal to advanced users to be cautious when updating to a new major version, but it does not prevent the distribution of malicious models within a compatible version range or for new installations. This mitigation is described in `/code/README.md` under the "Pretrained models" section.
- Missing mitigations:
  - **Integrity Checks**: Missing integrity checks for pre-trained models. The project should implement a mechanism to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded models. This could be achieved through:
    - **Checksums**: Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256) for each released model, allowing users to verify the downloaded model's integrity manually.
    - **Digital Signatures**: Digitally signing model releases, enabling automated verification of the model's authenticity and integrity during download.
  - **Secure Download Channel**: While HTTPS is likely used for GitHub downloads, it is not explicitly stated as a security measure in the project documentation. Explicitly enforcing and documenting HTTPS for model downloads is crucial to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during the download process.
- Preconditions:
  - **Compromised Release Process**: An attacker must successfully compromise the release process of the ml-compiler-opt GitHub repository. This could involve compromising maintainer accounts with release permissions or gaining unauthorized access to the release pipeline.
  - **`-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` Option**: Users must configure LLVM using the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` CMake option, triggering the automatic model download from GitHub.
- Source code analysis:
  - **File: `/code/README.md`**:
    - The section "Pretrained models" in `README.md` describes the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH` flag and the `download` option:
      ```markdown
      When building LLVM, there is a flag `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH` which you may
      set to the path to your inlining model. If the path is set to `download`, then
      cmake will download the most recent (compatible) model from github to use.
      ```
    - This documentation confirms the existence of the vulnerable download functionality and highlights the automatic download behavior without any mention of security measures like integrity checks or secure download channels.
    - The description of model releases as "github releases" further emphasizes the reliance on the GitHub release process, which becomes the target of the described attack vector.
- Security test case:
  - **Setup**:
    - **Compromised Release Simulation**: In a test environment, simulate a compromise of the `ml-compiler-opt` GitHub repository's release process. This can be done by setting up a local mock GitHub repository or manipulating network traffic to redirect model download requests.
    - **Malicious Model Creation**: Create a malicious pre-trained model. This model should be designed to introduce a detectable vulnerability or backdoor during compilation, for example, by subtly altering code generation in a way that leads to a buffer overflow or an authentication bypass in compiled binaries.
    - **LLVM Configuration**: Prepare a test LLVM build environment configured to use the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` option.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Trigger Malicious Download**: Configure and build LLVM in the test environment with `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download`. The CMake process should download the attacker's malicious model from the simulated compromised repository.
    2. **Compile Target Software**: Compile a simple, representative software project using the newly built, compromised LLVM. This software project should be designed to highlight the intended vulnerability or backdoor if the malicious model is effective.
    3. **Security Analysis**: Perform security analysis on the compiled software. This can include:
       - **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to scan the compiled code for potential vulnerabilities introduced by the malicious model.
       - **Dynamic Analysis**: Run the compiled software and use dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing, memory error detection) to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
       - **Manual Code Review**: Conduct a manual code review of the compiled software, specifically focusing on areas that the malicious model might have influenced, looking for backdoors or unexpected code patterns.
  - **Expected Outcome**:
    - The software compiled using the compromised LLVM exhibits the intended vulnerability or backdoor.
    - Security analysis tools and manual code review detect the introduced vulnerability or backdoor in the compiled software.
    - Benchmarking or testing demonstrates a functional difference or security regression in software compiled with the malicious model compared to software compiled with a legitimate model.
  - **Success Condition**:
    - The test is considered successful if it demonstrates that the software compiled with the malicious model contains exploitable vulnerabilities or backdoors, while software compiled with a legitimate model (or without the MLGO model) does not, thus validating the "Malicious Pre-trained Model Distribution" vulnerability.

# Combined Vulnerability Report

This report outlines a critical supply chain vulnerability related to the distribution and download of pre-trained models used in the LLVM compiler. The vulnerability stems from the lack of secure download mechanisms and integrity checks for these models, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious models into the compiler build process.

## Vulnerability: Malicious Pre-trained Model Distribution

### Description:
The LLVM build process, when configured with the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` flag, automatically downloads a pre-trained inliner model from GitHub releases. This download is performed over HTTP and lacks any mechanism to verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded model. Consequently, multiple attack vectors exist:

1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the user's machine and GitHub can intercept the HTTP request for the model. By injecting a malicious model into the network traffic, the attacker can replace the legitimate model during download. CMake, lacking integrity verification, will unknowingly use this malicious model.

2. **Compromised Release Process:** An attacker could compromise the pre-trained model release process on the `ml-compiler-opt` GitHub repository. By gaining control over the release mechanism (e.g., compromising maintainer accounts), the attacker can upload a malicious model disguised as a legitimate release. Users downloading the model will then obtain the compromised version directly from the source.

In both scenarios, when users subsequently compile code with this compromised LLVM compiler, the malicious model can guide compiler optimizations in harmful ways, potentially introducing subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors into the compiled software.

### Impact:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability poses a **critical** risk. By injecting malicious pre-trained models, attackers can compromise the LLVM compiler's inlining optimization process and potentially:

- **Introduce Security Vulnerabilities:** Malicious models can manipulate the compiler to generate code with exploitable vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, authentication bypasses, or other weaknesses. This could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in software compiled using the compromised LLVM version.
- **Deploy Backdoors:** Attackers can insert backdoors into compiled software, allowing them persistent and unauthorized access to systems running the compromised binaries.
- **Cause Subtle Malfunctions:** Even without introducing direct vulnerabilities, malicious models could cause subtle malfunctions or unexpected behavior in compiled software, leading to instability or incorrect operation.
- **Degrade Performance:** Malicious models could be designed to negatively impact the performance of compiled binaries through suboptimal inlining decisions.
- **Compromise the Compiler Itself:** In severe cases, the malicious model could lead to unexpected and harmful behavior of the compiler, potentially causing build failures or miscompilations.

The widespread use of LLVM means that a successful attack could have a far-reaching impact, affecting numerous downstream users and systems relying on software compiled with the compromised compiler.

### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- **Semantic Versioning**: The project uses semantic versioning for model releases. Major version bumps indicate breaking changes, which might prompt advanced users to exercise caution when updating. However, this measure does not prevent the distribution or use of malicious models, especially for new installations or within compatible version ranges. This is documented in `/code/README.md` under the "Pretrained models" section.
- **None**: There are no security measures implemented to ensure the secure download or integrity verification of the pre-trained models.

### Missing Mitigations:
- **Enforce HTTPS for Model Download**: The project must enforce HTTPS for downloading models from GitHub releases. This will encrypt the communication channel and prevent simple Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
- **Implement Model Integrity Verification**: It is crucial to implement a robust mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded models. This can be achieved through:
    - **Checksum Verification**: Generate and distribute checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) for each legitimate model release. CMake should then verify the downloaded model against the provided checksum before using it.
    - **Digital Signatures**: Digitally sign model files using a private key controlled by project maintainers. CMake should then verify the digital signature using the corresponding public key to ensure the model's authenticity and integrity.

### Preconditions:
- **User Action**: The user must explicitly enable the model download functionality by configuring CMake with the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` flag.
- **Network or Repository Vulnerability**:
    - **For MITM Attack**: The user must be on a network susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, typically using unencrypted HTTP connections for downloads.
    - **For Compromised Release**: The attacker must have successfully compromised the release process of the `ml-compiler-opt` GitHub repository or be able to manipulate network traffic to redirect download requests to a malicious source.

### Source Code Analysis:
The vulnerability is documented in the `/code/README.md` file, specifically in the "Pretrained models" section. It states:

```markdown
When building LLVM, there is a flag `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH` which you may
set to the path to your inlining model. If the path is set to `download`, then
cmake will download the most recent (compatible) model from github to use.
```

This documentation confirms that:

- The `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` flag triggers automatic model download.
- Models are downloaded from GitHub releases.
- There is no mention of any security measures like HTTPS, checksums, or digital signatures to protect the download process or verify model integrity.

The reliance on HTTP for downloads and the absence of integrity checks create the described vulnerability. While the exact CMake scripts responsible for the download are not detailed in the provided information, the `README.md` clearly outlines the vulnerable functionality and attack vectors.

### Security Test Case:
To verify the "Malicious Pre-trained Model Distribution" vulnerability, the following test case can be implemented:

**Environment Setup:**
1. **Controlled Network (for MITM test):** Set up a local network environment allowing interception of HTTP traffic using tools like `mitmproxy` or `Wireshark` and `iptables`.
2. **Compromised Release Simulation (for compromised release test):**  Simulate a compromised `ml-compiler-opt` GitHub repository release process. This can be done by:
    - Setting up a local mock GitHub repository mimicking the release structure.
    - Manipulating network traffic to redirect model download requests to a controlled server hosting malicious models.
3. **Malicious Model Creation:** Create a malicious pre-trained model designed to introduce a detectable change in compiled code. For example, the model could be crafted to cause a specific inlining decision that leads to a buffer overflow or incorrect code generation in a target program.
4. **LLVM Build Environment:** Prepare a clean LLVM build environment on a test machine, configured to use the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` CMake option.
5. **Target Software:** Prepare a simple, representative software project to compile using the compromised LLVM. This software should be designed to highlight the effects of the malicious model, such as triggering the intended vulnerability or backdoor.

**Steps:**
1. **Trigger Malicious Download:** Configure and initiate the CMake build process for LLVM with `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download`.
    - **For MITM test:** Configure the proxy server to intercept the HTTP request for the model and replace the legitimate model in the response with the prepared malicious model.
    - **For Compromised Release test:** Ensure the CMake process downloads the malicious model from the simulated compromised repository or redirected network path.
2. **Verify Malicious Model Installation:** After CMake configuration, verify that the malicious model is present in the LLVM build directory, replacing the expected legitimate model. This can be done by comparing file hashes or sizes if a legitimate model is available for comparison.
3. **Compile Target Software:** Compile the prepared target software project using the newly built, compromised LLVM compiler.
4. **Security Analysis of Compiled Software:** Perform security analysis on the compiled software to detect the impact of the malicious model:
    - **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan for vulnerabilities potentially introduced by the malicious model.
    - **Dynamic Analysis:** Run the compiled software and use dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing, memory error detection) to identify runtime vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
    - **Manual Code Review:** Review the generated code for backdoors, unexpected code patterns, or vulnerabilities in areas influenced by inlining decisions.
5. **Compare with Legitimate Build:** Compile the same target software using a legitimately built LLVM (without the `-DLLVM_INLINER_MODEL_PATH=download` flag or with a verified legitimate model). Compare the security analysis results, performance, and behavior of the binaries compiled with the compromised and legitimate LLVM builds.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Software compiled with the compromised LLVM (malicious model) exhibits the intended vulnerability, backdoor, or performance degradation, while software compiled with a legitimate LLVM build does not.
- Security analysis tools and manual code review detect the introduced vulnerabilities in the binaries compiled with the compromised LLVM.

**Success Condition:**
The test is successful if it demonstrably proves that using a malicious pre-trained model, delivered through either MITM attack or compromised release, leads to exploitable vulnerabilities or undesirable behavior in software compiled with the compromised LLVM, while a legitimate build does not exhibit these issues. This validates the "Malicious Pre-trained Model Distribution" vulnerability and its critical impact.
