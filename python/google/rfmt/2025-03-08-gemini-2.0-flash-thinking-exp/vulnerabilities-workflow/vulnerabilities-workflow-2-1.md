### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal
- Description:
    1. An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted file path as a command-line argument to the `rfmt` application.
    2. The `rfmt` application processes these file paths without proper validation or sanitization.
    3. When the application attempts to format the code, it uses the provided path directly in file operations such as backing up the original file and opening the file for reading and writing.
    4. By providing a path containing path traversal sequences like `../`, an attacker can manipulate the file paths to point to locations outside the intended directory.
    5. This can lead to the attacker reading arbitrary files on the server's file system during the read operation, or potentially overwriting arbitrary files during the write operation if the application runs with sufficient privileges.
- Impact:
    - **High:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system, potentially including configuration files, source code, or data files. In a worst-case scenario, if the application has write permissions, an attacker might be able to overwrite system files or application files, leading to data corruption or system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses the file paths provided as command-line arguments without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The application should validate and sanitize file paths provided by users. This should include:
        - Checking for path traversal sequences like `../` and `./`.
        - Ensuring that the path is within the expected directory or a set of allowed directories.
        - Using secure file path manipulation functions that prevent traversal, such as `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.normpath()` to resolve paths and remove traversal components, and then verifying that the resolved path is still within the intended directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `rfmt` application and provide command-line arguments.
    - The application must be run on a system where the attacker desires to read or write files.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `main` function in `/code/inst/python/rfmt.py` handles command-line arguments:
    ```python
    def main():
      """Main command routine."""
      try:
        options = base.Options()
        # ... argument parsing ...
        ap.parse_args(namespace=options)
        if options.files:  # Input is from a list of files
          for f_path in options.files:
            bak_path = None
            try:
              if options.bak:  # Make a source backup
                bak_path = f_path + '.bak'
                shutil.copy(f_path, bak_path)
              with open(f_path, 'rU') as f_input:  # Univeral line-end conversion
                if not options.quiet:
                  print >>sys.stderr, 'Formatting file "%s"' % f_path
                formatted_output = FormatInput(f_input, options)
              with open(f_path, 'w') as f_output:
                print >>f_output, formatted_output
                if not options.quiet:
                  print >>sys.stderr, ('Formatting of file "%s" complete' %
                                       f_path)
            except Exception as e:
              print >>sys.stderr, e
              if f_path != options.files[-1]:
                print 'Skipping to next file...'
        else:
          print FormatInput(sys.stdin.read(), options)
      except Exception as e:  # Format-specific errors.
        print >>sys.stderr, e
        sys.exit(1)
    ```
    2. The code iterates through the list of files provided in `options.files`.
    3. For each `f_path`, the code directly uses it in `shutil.copy(f_path, bak_path)` to create a backup and in `open(f_path, 'rU')` and `open(f_path, 'w')` to read and write the file.
    4. **Vulnerability:** There is no validation or sanitization of `f_path` before these file operations. An attacker can supply a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` and potentially read the `/etc/passwd` file.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Assume the `rfmt` application is installed and executable.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you can execute `rfmt`.
    3. Execute the `rfmt` application with a path traversal payload as a command-line argument. For example:
    ```bash
    python /path/to/rfmt.py ../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/rfmt.py` with the actual path to the `rfmt.py` script.
    4. **Expected Result (Vulnerability Confirmed):** The content of the `/etc/passwd` file (or another system file, depending on permissions and OS) will be printed to the standard output, or an error message indicating a failed operation on the provided path, but still demonstrating the attempt to access the file system using the manipulated path. If the backup option `-b` is enabled, the tool might try to copy `/etc/passwd` to `/etc/passwd.bak`, which could also indicate successful path traversal depending on permissions, even if it fails due to permission issues on `/etc/passwd`.
    5. **Mitigation Test:** After implementing path sanitization (e.g., using `os.path.abspath` and checking against an allowed base directory), repeat steps 3 and 4.
    6. **Expected Result (Mitigation Effective):** The application should either refuse to format the file (due to path traversal detection) or format a file within the allowed directory, without accessing or modifying files outside of it.  The test should not result in the content of `/etc/passwd` being printed or any operations attempted outside of the intended directories.
