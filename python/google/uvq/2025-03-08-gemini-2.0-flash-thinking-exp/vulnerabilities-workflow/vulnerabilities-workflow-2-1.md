### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Path Traversal in Video Filepath

* Description:
    * A malicious user can provide a crafted filepath as input to read files outside of the intended video input directory.
    * Step 1: The user provides a crafted filepath as part of the `--input_files` argument when running `uvq_main.py`. For example: `--input_files="test_video,10,../../../etc/passwd"`.
    * Step 2: The `uvq_main.py` script parses this input and extracts the filepath `../../../etc/passwd`.
    * Step 3: This filepath is passed to the `video_reader.VideoReader.load_video` function.
    * Step 4: Inside `load_video`, the filepath is directly embedded into an `ffmpeg` command: `ffmpeg -i [filepath] ...`.
    * Step 5: The `ffmpeg` command is executed using `subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)`.
    * Step 6: Due to the lack of input validation, `ffmpeg` attempts to process the file specified by the crafted path `../../../etc/passwd`, which is outside the intended video input directory.

* Impact:
    * An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the application has permissions to access. This could include sensitive information such as configuration files, application source code, or data files. In a more severe scenario, if the application were to use the filepath for writing operations (which is not the case in the current code but is a potential risk in similar vulnerabilities), it could lead to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The application directly uses the user-provided filepath without any validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for the filepath are missing.
    * Implement checks to ensure the filepath points to a file within the expected video input directory.
    * Consider using secure file path handling mechanisms that prevent path traversal, such as resolving the path to a canonical form and verifying it's within an allowed directory.
    * Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.check_output` when constructing commands with user-provided input. Instead, pass the command and arguments as a list to prevent shell injection vulnerabilities, although this might not directly mitigate path traversal in `ffmpeg` itself, it's a general security best practice.

* Preconditions:
    * The UVQ application must be running and accessible.
    * An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `--input_files` flag of `uvq_main.py`, specifically crafting the filepath part of the input.

* Source Code Analysis:
    * **File: /code/uvq_main.py**
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_string('input_files', '', 'configuration of input files.')
        ...
        video_id, video_length, filepath = FLAGS.input_files.split(',')
        ...
        utils.generate_features(video_id, video_length, filepath, FLAGS.model_dir, feature_dir, FLAGS.transpose)
        ```
        * The `input_files` flag is defined as a string, and its value is split by commas to extract `filepath`.
        * The `filepath` variable, directly derived from user input, is passed to the `generate_features` function.

    * **File: /code/uvq_utils.py**
        ```python
        def generate_features(video_id, video_length, filepath, model_dir, output_dir, transpose=False):
          """Generate features from input video."""
          video, video_resized = video_reader.VideoReader.load_video(filepath, video_length, transpose)
          ...
        ```
        * The `filepath` argument is directly passed to `video_reader.VideoReader.load_video` without any validation.

    * **File: /code/utils/video_reader.py**
        ```python
        class VideoReader:
            @staticmethod
            def load_video(filepath, video_length, transpose=False):
                """Load input video."""
                ...
                cmd = (
                    "ffmpeg  -i %s -filter_complex "
                    ' "[0:v]%sscale=w=%d:h=%d:flags=bicubic:force_original_aspect_ratio=1,'
                    'pad=%d:%d:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2,format=rgb24,split=2[out1][tmp],[tmp]scale=%d:%d:flags=bilinear[out2]"'
                    " -map [out1] -r %d -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 -y %s"
                    " -map [out2] -r %d -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 -y %s"
                ) % (
                    filepath, # <--- User-provided filepath is directly inserted here
                    transpose_param,
                    VIDEO_WIDTH,
                    VIDEO_HEIGHT,
                    VIDEO_WIDTH,
                    VIDEO_HEIGHT,
                    INPUT_WIDTH_CONTENT,
                    INPUT_HEIGHT_CONTENT,
                    VIDEO_FPS,
                    temp_filename,
                    VIDEO_FPS,
                    temp_filename_small,
                )
                ...
                subprocess.check_output(cmd, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True)
                ...
        ```
        * The `filepath` variable is directly embedded into the `ffmpeg` command string using `%s` formatting without any sanitization or validation.
        * `subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)` executes the constructed command, making the application vulnerable to path traversal if the `filepath` contains malicious path sequences.

* Security Test Case:
    * Step 1: Create a file named `test_file.txt` in the `/code/` directory with the content "This is a test file to verify path traversal vulnerability.".
    * Step 2: Run the `uvq_main.py` script with a crafted input filepath that attempts to read `test_file.txt` using a relative path:
        ```bash
        python3 uvq_main.py --input_files="test_video,10,test_file.txt" --output_dir=test_results --model_dir=models
        ```
        * Expected Result: The command will execute, attempting to process `test_file.txt` as a video file. `ffmpeg` will likely fail to process it as a video, but it demonstrates that the application can access files within the same directory using relative paths.

    * Step 3: Run the `uvq_main.py` script with a crafted input filepath that attempts to read `test_file.txt` using a path traversal sequence to go up one directory and then access the file:
        ```bash
        python3 uvq_main.py --input_files="test_video,10,./test_file.txt" --output_dir=test_results --model_dir=models
        ```
        * Expected Result: Similar to step 2, the command will execute, demonstrating that relative paths like `./test_file.txt` are also processed, confirming no restriction on relative paths within the current directory.

    * Step 4: Run the `uvq_main.py` script with a crafted input filepath that attempts to read a system file outside the intended directory using path traversal. For example, to attempt to read `/etc/passwd` (on Linux-like systems):
        ```bash
        python3 uvq_main.py --input_files="test_video,10,../../../etc/passwd" --output_dir=test_results --model_dir=models
        ```
        * Expected Result: The command will execute. `ffmpeg` will attempt to process `/etc/passwd`. Since `/etc/passwd` is not a video file, `ffmpeg` will fail and likely output an error message indicating that it couldn't process the file format. However, the execution of the command and the error message from `ffmpeg` will confirm that the application attempted to open and process `/etc/passwd`, thus validating the path traversal vulnerability. The output directory `test_results` might contain error logs from `ffmpeg` related to this attempt.
