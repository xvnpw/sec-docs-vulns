### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities identified within the Babel Tower project. These vulnerabilities arise from displaying unsanitized output from the Keyword Extraction and Translation modules, which could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.

#### 1. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Keyword Extraction output
    *   **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Keyword Extraction output
    *   **Description:**
        1.  An attacker crafts a malicious input string containing JavaScript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
        2.  An application using the Babel Tower library receives this user-provided text.
        3.  The application utilizes the `KeywordExtraction` module from Babel Tower to extract keywords from the text.
        4.  The `KeywordExtraction` module processes the input text and returns a list of keywords.
        5.  The application then displays these extracted keywords on a web page, for instance, within HTML tags like `<div>` or `<p>`.
        6.  Crucially, the application fails to sanitize or encode the keywords before rendering them in the HTML.
        7.  As a result, the malicious JavaScript code injected by the attacker is executed by the user's web browser when the page is loaded, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
        *   Attackers can inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
        *   These scripts can be used to steal session cookies, hijack user sessions, deface websites, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The Babel Tower library does not implement any output sanitization or encoding for keyword extraction.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   The application that utilizes the Babel Tower library must sanitize or encode the output from the `KeywordExtraction` module before displaying it on a web page. This can be achieved by using appropriate encoding functions provided by the web development framework or templating engine used by the application (e.g., HTML escaping).
    *   **Preconditions:**
        1.  An application is built using the Babel Tower library.
        2.  This application uses the `KeywordExtraction` module to process user-provided text.
        3.  The application displays the extracted keywords on a web page.
        4.  The application does not sanitize or encode the output from the `KeywordExtraction` module before displaying it.
    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  Inspect the file `/code/src/gps_babel_tower/tasks/keyword_extraction/keyword_extraction.py`.
        2.  The `KeywordExtraction` class is defined, containing the `extract_keywords(self, text, lang=None, max_results=-1)` method.
        3.  This method takes user-provided `text` as input.
        4.  The method processes the text using different keyword extraction models (like `rake`, `keybert`, `spacy_bigram`).
        5.  The extracted keywords are returned as a list of strings.
        6.  The code does not perform any sanitization or encoding on these output strings.
        7.  For example, in the `rake` model case:
            ```python
            elif self.kw_model == 'rake':
                if lang == 'ja':
                    tokens = self.ja_tok.tokenize(text)
                    self.ja_rake.extract_keywords_from_text(tokens)
                    keywords = self.ja_rake.get_ranked_phrases() # keywords is a list of strings
                else:
                    self.model.extract_keywords_from_text(text)
                    keywords = self.model.get_ranked_phrases() # keywords is a list of strings
            ```
        8.  The `keywords` list, containing raw strings from the input text, is returned directly without any encoding.
    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Create a simple web application (e.g., using Flask or Django in Python) that uses the Babel Tower library.
        2.  In this application, create a route that takes user input text and uses `KeywordExtraction` to extract keywords.
        3.  Display the extracted keywords in the HTML response without any sanitization. For example, in a Flask template:
            ```html
            <div>Extracted Keywords:</div>
            <ul>
            {% for keyword in keywords %}
                <li>{{ keyword }}</li> {# Vulnerable line - no escaping #}
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            ```
        4.  As an attacker, input the following text into the application: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Keyword_Extraction')> Keyword1 Keyword2`.
        5.  Access the application through a web browser.
        6.  Observe that an alert box with "XSS_Keyword_Extraction" is displayed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability because the malicious HTML tag in the input text was processed and rendered without sanitization.

#### 2. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Translation output
    *   **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Translation output
    *   **Description:**
        1.  An attacker crafts a malicious input string designed to exploit translation processes to generate JavaScript code, for example, by inputting text that, when translated, results in `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
        2.  An application using the Babel Tower library receives this user-provided text.
        3.  The application utilizes the `TranslationClient` module from Babel Tower to translate the text to another language and possibly back, or simply to display the translated output.
        4.  The `TranslationClient` module performs the translation and returns the translated text as a string.
        5.  The application then displays this translated text on a web page without sanitizing or encoding it.
        6.  If the translation process inadvertently or due to adversarial crafting generates JavaScript code within the translated text, and the application renders this output directly in HTML, the script will be executed in the user's browser.
        7.  This execution leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
        *   Attackers can inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users through translation service outputs.
        *   Consequences are the same as described for the Keyword Extraction XSS vulnerability: stealing session cookies, hijacking user sessions, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, etc.
    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium to High
    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The Babel Tower library does not implement any output sanitization for translation results.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   The application that uses the Babel Tower library's `TranslationClient` must sanitize or encode the translated text before displaying it on a web page. Similar to keyword extraction, this should be handled in the application layer using appropriate encoding techniques.
    *   **Preconditions:**
        1.  An application is built using the Babel Tower library.
        2.  This application uses the `TranslationClient` module to translate user-provided text.
        3.  The application displays the translated text on a web page.
        4.  The application does not sanitize or encode the translated output before displaying it.
    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  Examine the file `/code/src/gps_babel_tower/tasks/translation/translation.py`.
        2.  The `TranslationClient` class is defined with a `translate(self, sentence, target_lang, src_lang=None)` method.
        3.  This method takes user-provided `sentence` as input and translates it to `target_lang`.
        4.  The translation is performed using either Hugging Face models or Google Cloud Translation API.
        5.  The translated text is returned as a string.
        6.  No sanitization or encoding is applied to the translated string within the `TranslationClient` module.
        7.  For example, using HuggingFace translation:
            ```python
            def _translate_hf(self, sentence, src_lang, target_lang):
                tokenizer, model = self._get_hf_model(src_lang, target_lang)
                inputs = tokenizer.encode(sentence, return_tensors='pt')
                outputs = model.generate(
                    inputs, max_length=40, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
                return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]).replace('<pad>', '') # Returns raw translated string
            ```
        8.  The raw translated string is returned and is potentially vulnerable if displayed unsanitized.
    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Create a simple web application (e.g., using Flask or Django) that uses the Babel Tower library.
        2.  Implement a route that accepts user input text and uses `TranslationClient` to translate it (e.g., to English).
        3.  Display the translated text in the HTML response without any sanitization. For example, in a Flask template:
            ```html
            <div>Translated Text:</div>
            <p>{{ translated_text }}</p> {# Vulnerable line - no escaping #}
            ```
        4.  As an attacker, input text that might translate into a JavaScript payload. A simple test is to try to translate HTML or JavaScript tags. For example, try inputting:  `English: <script>alert("XSS_Translation")</script>`. Or try a more indirect approach by translating a phrase from another language that might result in a script tag in English after translation.
        5.  Access the application via a web browser.
        6.  If the translation and rendering result in the execution of JavaScript (e.g., an alert box with "XSS_Translation" appears), it confirms the XSS vulnerability. Note that translation outputs can be unpredictable, so it might require some experimentation to find a payload that successfully translates into exploitable code.
