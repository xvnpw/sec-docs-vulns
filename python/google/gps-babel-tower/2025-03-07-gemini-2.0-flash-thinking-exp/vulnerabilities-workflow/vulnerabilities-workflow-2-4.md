- vulnerability name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Translation Output
- description:
    - A web application uses the `gps_babel_tower` library to translate user-provided text.
    - The application then displays the translated text to users without proper sanitization.
    - An attacker can craft a malicious text input containing JavaScript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    - When the web application translates this malicious input and displays the unsanitized output, the JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.
- impact:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    - This can lead to:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies to impersonate users.
        - Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page.
        - Redirection to malicious sites: Redirecting users to phishing or malware websites.
        - Unauthorized actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as making purchases or changing account settings.
- vulnerability rank: Medium
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The `gps_babel_tower` library focuses on Natural Language Processing tasks and does not include output sanitization functionalities.
- missing mitigations:
    - The web application that uses the `gps_babel_tower` library must implement output sanitization before displaying any translated text to users.
    - This sanitization should encode or remove HTML special characters and JavaScript code to prevent execution in the browser.
- preconditions:
    - A web application is using the `gps_babel_tower` library's `TranslationClient` to translate user-provided text.
    - The web application displays the translated output in a web page without proper sanitization.
- source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/gps_babel_tower/tasks/translation/translation.py`
    - Function: `TranslationClient.translate(self, sentence, target_lang, src_lang=None)`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The `translate` function takes a `sentence` as input, which can be user-provided text.
        2. It uses either Hugging Face models (`_translate_hf`) or Google Cloud Translation API (`translate_client.translate`) to perform translation.
        3. The translated text is returned as a string.
        4. **Crucially, there is no sanitization or encoding of the translated text within the `gps_babel_tower` library.**
        5. If a web application directly embeds this translated string into an HTML page (e.g., using JavaScript's `innerHTML` or similar server-side rendering methods) without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
    - Visualization: Not applicable for this type of vulnerability analysis.
- security test case:
    - Step 1: Set up a simple Python web application (e.g., using Flask or Django) that utilizes the `gps_babel_tower` library.
    - Step 2: Create a web page with a text input field where a user can enter text to be translated to English.
    - Step 3: In the backend of the web application, use `TranslationClient().translate(user_input, target_lang='en')` to translate the text.
    - Step 4: Display the translated output on the web page directly using a template engine or JavaScript without any HTML sanitization. For example, in a Flask template: `<div>{{ translated_text }}</div>` or in JavaScript: `document.getElementById('translation-output').innerHTML = translatedText;`
    - Step 5: As an attacker, enter the following malicious text in the input field: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Translation')>`
    - Step 6: Submit the text for translation.
    - Step 7: Observe the web page. If an alert box with "XSS-Translation" appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. This demonstrates that malicious JavaScript injected through the input text is being executed in the browser because the translated output was not sanitized before being displayed.

- vulnerability name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Keyword Extraction Output
- description:
    - A web application uses the `gps_babel_tower` library to extract keywords from user-provided text.
    - The application then displays the extracted keywords to users without proper sanitization.
    - An attacker can craft a malicious text input that, when processed for keyword extraction, results in malicious JavaScript being included in the extracted keywords. For example: Input text: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')> keyword`. Depending on the keyword extraction model, parts of the HTML tag could be considered keywords.
    - When the web application displays these unsanitized keywords, the JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.
- impact:
    - Similar to XSS in translation output, leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and unauthorized actions.
- vulnerability rank: Medium
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The `gps_babel_tower` library does not include output sanitization.
- missing mitigations:
    - The web application using `gps_babel_tower` for keyword extraction must sanitize the extracted keywords before displaying them.
    - Sanitize by encoding or removing HTML special characters and JavaScript code.
- preconditions:
    - A web application is using the `gps_babel_tower` library's `KeywordExtraction` to extract keywords from user-provided text.
    - The web application displays the extracted keywords in a web page without proper sanitization.
- source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/gps_babel_tower/tasks/keyword_extraction/keyword_extraction.py`
    - Function: `KeywordExtraction.extract_keywords(self, text, lang=None, max_results=-1)`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. The `extract_keywords` function takes `text` as input, which can be user-provided.
        2. It uses different keyword extraction models (rake, keybert, spacy_bigram) to extract keywords.
        3. The function returns a list of extracted keywords as strings.
        4. **The `gps_babel_tower` library does not sanitize these extracted keywords.**
        5. If a web application directly displays these keywords in HTML without sanitization, it's vulnerable to XSS.
- security test case:
    - Step 1: Set up a simple web application using `gps_babel_tower` for keyword extraction.
    - Step 2: Create a web page with a text input field for users to enter text for keyword extraction.
    - Step 3: In the backend, use `KeywordExtraction('rake').extract_keywords(user_input)` (or any other model) to extract keywords.
    - Step 4: Display the extracted keywords on the web page without sanitization. For example, in a loop in a template: `{% for keyword in keywords %} <span>{{ keyword }}</span> {% endfor %}` or using JavaScript: `keywords.forEach(keyword => { keywordOutputDiv.innerHTML += '<span>' + keyword + '</span>'; });`
    - Step 5: As an attacker, enter the following malicious text in the input field: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Keywords')> keyword1 keyword2`
    - Step 6: Submit the text for keyword extraction.
    - Step 7: Observe the web page. If an alert box with "XSS-Keywords" appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. This happens because the malicious HTML tag injected through the input is processed and displayed as part of the keywords without sanitization.
