### Vulnerability List for Linux Kernel Sanitizers Prototypes

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities within the Linux Kernel Sanitizers Prototypes project. Each vulnerability is detailed in its own section below.

#### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Malicious Symbol File Filenames

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Malicious Symbol File Filenames
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious symbol file (e.g., a modified `vmlinux`) such that when `addr2line` is run against it for a specific address, it returns a filename that contains command injection sequences, like `$(malicious_command)`.
    2.  The attacker then crafts a malicious kernel bug report that includes a stack trace with addresses that, when symbolized using the malicious symbol file, trigger the vulnerable filename output from `addr2line`.
    3.  A developer, intending to analyze a bug report, uses `symbolizer.py` with the `--linux` option pointing to the directory containing the malicious symbol file and pipes the malicious bug report to `symbolizer.py`'s stdin.
    4.  `symbolizer.py` processes the bug report, calls `addr2line` with the malicious symbol file, and `addr2line` returns the malicious filename.
    5.  `symbolizer.py` prints the symbolized stack trace, including the malicious filename, to the developer's terminal.
    6.  If the developer copies and pastes this symbolized output into a terminal that performs command substitution (e.g., bash), the malicious command embedded in the filename gets executed on the developer's machine.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the developer's machine.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input validation for filenames returned by `addr2line`. The script should sanitize or reject filenames that contain shell command injection sequences.
    *   Documentation warning to developers about the risks of using symbolizer with untrusted symbol files and to be cautious when copying and pasting output from symbolizer, especially into a terminal.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker can create a malicious symbol file or a malicious `addr2line` wrapper that makes `addr2line` return malicious filenames.
    *   Developer uses `symbolizer.py` with the `--linux` option pointing to a directory containing the malicious symbol file or wrapper.
    *   Developer copies and pastes the output of `symbolizer.py` into a terminal that performs command substitution.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The `print_frame` function in `tools/symbolizer.py` is responsible for printing the symbolized stack frame.
    *   It takes `fileline` as input, which is directly obtained from the output of `addr2line` through the `Symbolizer.process` method.
    *   The `print_frame` function then prints this `fileline` without any sanitization:
        ```python
        def print_frame(self, inlined, precise, prefix, addr, func, fileline, body):
            ...
            if addr != None:
                print('%s[<%s>] %s%s %s' % (prefix, addr, precise, body, fileline))
            else:
                print('%s%s%s %s' % (prefix, precise, body, fileline))
        ```
    *   There is no input validation or sanitization on `fileline` before printing. This allows for the injection of malicious content from `addr2line` output into the terminal output of `symbolizer.py`.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare Malicious addr2line wrapper:** Create a script named `addr2line` in a directory, say `malicious_tools/`. This script will always output a malicious filename.
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "??:0 $(echo vulnerable_command_executed)"
        echo "??"
        ```
        Make this script executable: `chmod +x malicious_tools/addr2line`.
    2.  **Create Malicious Bug Report:** Create a text file `malicious_report.txt` with a stack frame address.
        ```
        [  123.456789]  [<ffffffff88888888>] some_function+0x10/0x20
        ```
    3.  **Run symbolizer.py with Malicious Tools Path:** Run `symbolizer.py` with `--linux=./malicious_tools --strip=./malicious_tools < malicious_report.txt`. Ensure that the current directory is the `/code/tools` directory where `symbolizer.py` is located.
    4.  **Examine Output:** Check the output of `symbolizer.py`. It will contain a line with the malicious filename, like: `??:0 $(echo vulnerable_command_executed)`.
    5.  **Copy and Paste Output to Terminal:** Copy the line containing the malicious filename and paste it into a bash terminal. Observe if the command `echo vulnerable_command_executed` is executed in the terminal. If the message `vulnerable_command_executed` is printed in the terminal after pasting, it confirms the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 2: Improper Input Validation in Symbolizer Script

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Improper Input Validation in Symbolizer Script
*   **Description:** The `symbolizer.py` script is susceptible to improper input validation when processing kernel reports. A malicious user can craft a kernel report containing malformed lines, such as excessively long lines, lines with unexpected characters, or lines deviating from the expected format for stack traces. When `symbolizer.py` processes such a report, it may lead to unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion (though explicitly excluding DoS, consider impact on usability), or potentially other vulnerabilities due to insufficient validation of the input data against expected formats and constraints.  Specifically, if an attacker provides an input with extremely long function names or other components of stack frames, the script might not handle these cases gracefully, potentially leading to resource consumption or unexpected errors.
*   **Impact:** Potential for script to become unresponsive or terminate unexpectedly when processing crafted input. While not a direct remote code execution vulnerability, it can disrupt the developer's workflow by making the symbolizer tool unreliable when dealing with potentially malicious or malformed reports.  In a broader context, if a developer relies on this tool for security analysis of kernel crash reports, its failure due to malformed input could hinder the debugging process.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the provided code explicitly for input validation of the report content itself. The script relies on regular expressions for parsing, but does not enforce limits on input line lengths or complexity of parsed components beyond what the regexes implicitly handle.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Implement robust input validation for all parts of the input report, including:
        *   Limiting the length of input lines to prevent excessive memory consumption during processing.
        *   Validating the format of addresses to ensure they are valid hexadecimal numbers.
        *   Sanitizing or limiting the length of function names and module names to prevent potential buffer overflows or excessive processing time (though Python is memory-safe, performance can still degrade).
        *   Implementing checks to ensure the input report generally adheres to the expected structure of kernel crash reports, and gracefully handling deviations.
    *   Implement error handling to catch exceptions during input processing and provide informative error messages to the user instead of crashing or hanging.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A developer uses the `symbolizer.py` script to process a kernel report.
    *   The kernel report is crafted by a malicious user or is malformed in a way that deviates significantly from the expected format.
    *   The attacker needs to provide or induce the developer to process this malicious report using the `symbolizer.py` script.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The script uses regular expressions (`FRAME_RE`, `RIP_RE`, `LR_RE`, `KSAN_RE`) to parse lines of the input report.
    *   Review the regular expressions for their robustness against maliciously crafted inputs. For example, check if they are susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) if given complex or unexpected input patterns. While the provided regexes seem relatively simple, a more in-depth analysis is needed to rule out ReDoS completely, especially if combined with very long input lines.
    *   Analyze the code paths that handle the results of these regular expression matches.  Specifically, examine how the extracted groups (function name, address, module name, etc.) are used. If these extracted strings are used in operations that assume a certain length or format without validation, it could lead to issues when processing malformed input.
    *   The script reads input line by line using `sys.stdin`. There is no explicit limit on the length of lines read. If a malicious report contains extremely long lines that match the regexes partially, it could lead to performance degradation or memory issues during regex processing or subsequent string operations.
    *   The `Symbolizer` class uses `subprocess.Popen` to call `addr2line`. While the arguments to `addr2line` are controlled by the script, if malformed addresses are passed to `addr2line` due to incorrect parsing, it might lead to unexpected behavior, although vulnerabilities in `addr2line` itself are less likely.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Craft a malformed kernel report with excessively long lines:**
        ```
        [  1234.567890] [<ffffffff81000000>] very_long_function_name_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+0x123/0x456 [module_name]
        ```
    2.  Save this report to a file, e.g., `malformed_report.txt`.
    3.  Run the `symbolizer.py` script:
        ```bash
        cat malformed_report.txt | ./symbolizer.py --linux=<path/to/kernel>
        ```
    4.  Observe the script's behavior. Check for:
        *   Increased CPU or memory usage.
        *   Script hanging or becoming unresponsive.
        *   Error messages or exceptions being printed to stderr.
        *   Significant delay in processing.

    5.  **Craft a malformed report with unexpected characters in function/module names:**
        ```
        [  1234.567890] [<ffffffff81000000>] function!@#$%^&*()+0x123/0x456 [module!@#$%^&*()]
        ```
    6.  Repeat steps 2-4 with this new malformed report.

    7.  **Craft a report with lines not matching expected formats:**
        ```
        This is a completely malformed line that should not match any regex.
        [  1234.567890] This line is missing the function part [<ffffffff81000000>] +0x123/0x456 [module_name]
        [  1234.567890] [<invalid_address_format>] function+0x123/0x456 [module_name]
        ```
    8.  Repeat steps 2-4 with this new malformed report to check for error handling when lines don't match expected patterns.

    Successful execution of these test cases showing script unresponsiveness, crashes, or significant performance degradation would confirm the input validation vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 3: Potential Path Traversal in symbolizer.py

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Path Traversal in symbolizer.py
*   **Description:**
    The `symbolizer.py` script uses user-provided paths via the `--linux` and `--strip` arguments to locate kernel binaries for symbolization. While the script utilizes `os.path.join` for path construction, it may still be susceptible to path traversal vulnerabilities if these paths are not adequately validated. An attacker could potentially provide a maliciously crafted path as an argument (e.g., `--linux=/tmp/malicious_path`) that, when combined with module names extracted from an input log file, could lead to the script accessing or attempting to execute files outside the intended kernel build directory. This could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code if a malicious executable is placed at a predictable path.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1.  An attacker prepares a malicious directory containing an executable file named `vmlinux` (or a kernel module name expected in the log).
    2.  The attacker crafts a kernel log file containing stack traces with module names that would cause the `symbolizer.py` script to search for binaries.
    3.  The attacker convinces a user (e.g., a kernel developer) to use `symbolizer.py` to symbolize the crafted log file, providing the path to the malicious directory using the `--linux` argument.
    4.  When `symbolizer.py` processes the log file, it uses the attacker-controlled path to search for and potentially execute binaries (like `addr2line` on a crafted `vmlinux`).
*   **Impact:**
    Successful path traversal could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system where the `symbolizer.py` script is run. If a developer uses this tool in an automated or semi-automated fashion, this could lead to a compromised development environment. The attacker's code would be executed with the privileges of the user running the `symbolizer.py` script.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   The script uses `os.path.join` for path construction, which provides some protection against naive path traversal attempts.
    *   The `README.md` file notes that the repository contains prototypes and out-of-tree information, implicitly suggesting caution when using the code.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization for the `--linux` and `--strip` paths to strictly limit the directories that the script can access. For example, paths could be checked to be within an expected base directory or against a whitelist of allowed paths.
    *   Sandboxing or privilege separation when executing external tools like `addr2line` and `readelf` to limit the potential damage if these tools are compromised or if path traversal is successful.
    *   Principle of least privilege: Ensure the script is run with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user to run `symbolizer.py` on a malicious log file with a crafted `--linux` or `--strip` path argument.
    *   The user must have `addr2line` and `readelf` tools installed and accessible in their PATH.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable file (e.g., named `vmlinux`) in a directory accessible via path traversal from the user-provided `--linux` or `--strip` path.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  The `ReportProcessor` class in `symbolizer.py` initializes with `linux_paths` and `strip_paths` from command-line arguments.
    2.  The `load_module` method in `ReportProcessor` uses the `find_file` function, passing a path from `linux_paths` and a module name from the input log.
    3.  The `find_file` function uses `os.path.expanduser` and `os.walk` starting from the provided path.
    4.  `os.path.join(root, f)` is used to construct file paths inside `find_file`.
    5.  The constructed `module_path` is then used to create `Symbolizer` and `SymbolOffsetTable` objects, which execute `addr2line` and `readelf` respectively using `subprocess.Popen` and `subprocess.check_output`.
    6.  There is no explicit validation of the `linux_paths` and `strip_paths` arguments to prevent them from being malicious or leading to path traversal outside of intended directories before they are used in file system operations and command execution.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a directory `/tmp/vuln_test`.
    2.  Inside `/tmp/vuln_test`, create a subdirectory `malicious_dir`.
    3.  Inside `/tmp/vuln_test/malicious_dir`, create an executable file named `vmlinux` (e.g., using `touch /tmp/vuln_test/malicious_dir/vmlinux; chmod +x /tmp/vuln_test/malicious_dir/vmlinux`). This `vmlinux` should simply print "Exploited Path Traversal!" to stdout and exit (e.g., `echo "Exploited Path Traversal!"`).
    4.  Create a log file named `test_report.log` in `/tmp/vuln_test` with the following content:
        ```
        [  123.456789] [<ffffffff8110424c>] call_function+0x2c/0x30 [vmlinux]
        ```
    5.  Open a terminal and navigate to `/tmp/vuln_test`.
    6.  Execute the `symbolizer.py` script with a crafted `--linux` path pointing to the malicious directory:
        ```bash
        /path/to/symbolizer.py --linux=./malicious_dir < test_report.log
        ```
        (Replace `/path/to/symbolizer.py` with the actual path to the `symbolizer.py` script).
    7.  Check the output in the terminal. If "Exploited Path Traversal!" is printed, it indicates that the malicious `vmlinux` from `/tmp/vuln_test/malicious_dir` was executed, demonstrating a potential path traversal vulnerability.
