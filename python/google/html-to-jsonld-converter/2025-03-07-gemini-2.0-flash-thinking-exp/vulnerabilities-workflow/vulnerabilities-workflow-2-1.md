#### 1. HTML Injection in Preview HTML

* Description:
    1. The `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd.preview` function in `/code/Utility/preview_html_of_json_ld.py` generates an HTML preview based on the processed JSON-LD data.
    2. This function directly embeds values from the JSON-LD (specifically `s:headline`, `s:description`, `s:image`) into the HTML output using string formatting without proper HTML escaping.
    3. If an attacker can control the HTML input and inject malicious HTML code into attributes that are parsed and placed into these JSON-LD fields, this malicious HTML will be directly embedded into the preview HTML.
    4. When a user views the generated preview HTML file (e.g., `output/result.html`), the injected malicious HTML will be executed by their browser. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the context of the preview functionality.

* Impact:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the preview HTML.
    - An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the preview HTML.
    - This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or deface the preview page.

* Vulnerability rank: Medium

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code in `Utility/preview_html_of_json_ld.py` does not perform any HTML escaping or sanitization on the data extracted from the JSON-LD before embedding it into the preview HTML.

* Missing mitigations:
    - HTML escaping should be implemented in the `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd.preview` function.
    - Specifically, the values of `showcaseBlock['s:headline']`, `item['s:headline']`, `item['s:description']`, and `item['s:image']` should be HTML escaped before being inserted into the HTML strings in the `__preview_headline`, `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, and `__preview_image` methods.
    - Libraries like `html` module in Python can be used for escaping.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to provide a malicious HTML input, either via the `--html_file` or `--html_string` argument when running `main.py`.
    - The malicious HTML input must be crafted in a way that, after being processed by the HTML to JSON-LD converter, results in malicious HTML code being placed into the `s:headline`, `s:description`, or `s:image` fields of the generated JSON-LD.

* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/Utility/preview_html_of_json_ld.py`
    - Function: `preview(self, json)` and helper methods `__preview_headline`, `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, `__preview_image`.
    - Code snippet:
      ```python
      def __preview_headline(self, headline_text):
          return '<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Roboto;margin:12px' \
                 ';font-size:18px;font-weight:700;" >{text}</p>' \
              .format(text=headline_text)
      ```
      - The `{text}` placeholder in the HTML string is directly replaced with the `headline_text` value, which originates from the JSON-LD. No HTML escaping is performed before this substitution. This pattern is repeated in `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, and `__preview_image`.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      JSON-LD (malicious content) --> PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd.preview --> HTML Preview (malicious HTML injected, no escaping) --> Browser (XSS execution)
      ```

* Security test case:
    1. Create a file named `malicious_input.html` with the following content:
       ```html
       <div id="prdDetail">
           <p><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="title">Headline <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script></span></p>
       </div>
       ```
    2. Run the `main.py` script with the malicious HTML file as input:
       ```bash
       python /code/main.py -f malicious_input.html -c prdDetail -j output/malicious.json -p output/preview_xss.html
       ```
    3. Open the generated preview HTML file `output/preview_xss.html` in a web browser.
    4. Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed. This confirms that the JavaScript code injected in the HTML input was executed in the context of the preview HTML, demonstrating the HTML injection vulnerability.

#### 2. Potential Bypass of HTML Sanitization via Inline Event Handlers

* Description:
    1. The `HtmlSectionCleaner` in `/code/Utility/html_section_cleaner.py` aims to sanitize HTML content by removing blacklisted tags (defined in `Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS`) and tags with specific classes (defined in `Constants.FILTER_TAGS`).
    2. However, the current sanitization logic is limited to tag and class-based filtering. It does not remove or sanitize HTML attributes, specifically inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, etc.).
    3. An attacker could craft a malicious HTML input containing inline event handlers within tags that are not blacklisted or filtered by class.
    4. These inline event handlers can contain JavaScript code that will be executed when the HTML is processed or rendered, potentially bypassing the intended sanitization and leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    5. Although the generated output is JSON-LD, the presence of unsanitized content in the JSON-LD can still be a vulnerability if the consuming system processes or renders this JSON-LD in a way that could execute the injected JavaScript (though less likely in typical JSON-LD consumption scenarios, the risk exists if the JSON-LD is later used to generate HTML or other renderable content without further sanitization).

* Impact:
    - Potential bypass of HTML sanitization.
    - Although direct execution in the JSON-LD context is not the primary concern, the presence of unsanitized JavaScript code in the JSON-LD output is a vulnerability as it violates the principle of least privilege and introduces risk if the JSON-LD is later processed in a less secure manner.
    - If the JSON-LD is used to generate content for other systems that might interpret HTML or JavaScript, this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting or other client-side vulnerabilities in those systems.

* Vulnerability rank: Medium

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - `HtmlSectionCleaner` removes blacklisted tags and tags with specific classes.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement more comprehensive HTML sanitization that includes removing or neutralizing inline event handlers and other potentially harmful HTML attributes.
    - Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library that is designed to prevent XSS and other HTML-based injection attacks.
    - A whitelist approach to allowed HTML tags and attributes would be more secure than a blacklist approach.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to provide a malicious HTML input, either via the `--html_file` or `--html_string` argument when running `main.py`.
    - The malicious HTML input must contain inline event handlers within HTML tags that are not blacklisted or filtered by class in `HtmlSectionCleaner`.

* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/Utility/html_section_cleaner.py`
    - Function: `clean(self)`
    - Code snippet:
      ```python
      for tag in detail(Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS):
          tag.decompose()
      for tag in Constants.FILTER_TAGS:
          for child in detail.findChildren(class_=tag):
              child.decompose()
      ```
      - The code iterates through `BLACKLISTED_TAGS` and `FILTER_TAGS` and removes matching tags or tags with matching classes.
      - It does not examine or remove HTML attributes like inline event handlers.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      HTML Input (with inline event handler) --> HtmlSectionCleaner (tag/class blacklist, attribute bypass) --> JSON-LD Output (unsanitized event handler potentially present)
      ```

* Security test case:
    1. Create a file named `bypass_sanitization_input.html` with the following content:
       ```html
       <div id="prdDetail">
           <p><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="title"><div onclick='alert("Sanitization Bypass")'>Headline with Event Handler</div></span></p>
       </div>
       ```
    2. Run the `main.py` script with the crafted HTML file:
       ```bash
       python /code/main.py -f bypass_sanitization_input.html -c prdDetail -j output/bypass_sanitization.json -p output/preview_bypass.html
       ```
    3. Inspect the generated JSON-LD file `output/bypass_sanitization.json`.
    4. Check if the `onclick` attribute or the `div` tag with the `onclick` attribute is present in the JSON-LD, especially within the `s:headline` or `s:description` values. For example, the JSON-LD might contain: `"s:headline": "<div onclick='alert(\"Sanitization Bypass\")'>Headline with Event Handler</div>"`.
    5. If the `onclick` attribute is present in the JSON-LD output, it indicates that the inline event handler was not sanitized and bypassed the current sanitization mechanisms.
