## Combined Vulnerability List

*   #### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in HTML Preview

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The application takes HTML input, either from a file or string, and converts it to JSON-LD.
        2.  As part of the process, it generates an HTML preview of the converted JSON-LD using the `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd` class in `/code/Utility/preview_html_of_json_ld.py`.
        3.  The `preview` method in `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd` iterates through the JSON-LD structure and dynamically constructs HTML strings by embedding data from the JSON-LD into predefined HTML templates using `.format()`.
        4.  Specifically, the `__preview_headline`, `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, and `__preview_image` methods in `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd` use `.format()` to insert text and image URLs directly into HTML tags like `<p>` and `<img>`.
        5.  If the input HTML contains malicious content that is parsed and ends up in the `s:headline`, `s:description`, or `s:image` fields of the JSON-LD, this malicious content will be directly inserted into the HTML preview without proper sanitization or output encoding.
        6.  When a user views this generated HTML preview, the malicious script embedded in the HTML will be executed in their browser, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
        7.  While the application is designed for local use, the generated preview HTML could be shared or hosted elsewhere, increasing the risk. Even in local context, a merchant partner might use this preview file for validation and inadvertently execute malicious code.

    *   **Impact:**
        An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML preview. When a user views this preview, the script will execute in their browser. This can lead to:
        *   **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information to impersonate the user.
        *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data accessible to the user.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or injecting malware into their system.
        *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the HTML preview page.
        *   **Information Disclosure**: The attacker could potentially access sensitive information accessible to the user's browser, such as cookies or local storage, if the preview HTML is opened in a context where such data exists.
        *   **Client-Side Redirection**: The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.
        *   **Reduced Data Integrity Perception**: While the JSON-LD itself might be structurally as expected (except for the injected content), the preview HTML, intended for validation, will be misleading and potentially confusing for the merchant partner, reducing trust in the conversion process.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   The `HtmlSectionCleaner` class in `/code/Utility/html_section_cleaner.py` attempts to sanitize the input HTML by removing blacklisted tags (like `script`, `style`, `iframe`) and tags with specific classes (defined in `Constants.FILTER_TAGS`). This is implemented in the `clean` method of `HtmlSectionCleaner` class, which is called in `Processor.process_section`.
        *   Blacklisted tags are defined in `Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS` in `Constants.py`.
        *   Filtered classes are defined in `Constants.FILTER_TAGS` in `Constants.py`.
        *   `JsonSanitizer` in `/code/Utility/sanitizer.py` removes empty fields and lists from the JSON-LD. It does not perform HTML sanitization on the string values within the JSON-LD.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Output Encoding:** The most critical missing mitigation is output encoding in the `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd` class. The code directly embeds strings from the JSON-LD into HTML templates using `.format()` without encoding them for HTML context. This means that if the JSON-LD contains HTML special characters (like `<`, `>`, `"`, `&`, `'`), they will be interpreted as HTML code, leading to XSS.  Specifically, HTML escaping should be implemented in the `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd.preview` function. The values of `showcaseBlock['s:headline']`, `item['s:headline']`, `item['s:description']`, and `item['s:image']` should be HTML escaped before being inserted into the HTML strings in the `__preview_headline`, `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, and `__preview_image` methods. Libraries like `html` module in Python can be used for escaping.
        *   **Robust HTML Sanitization of Input**:  Instead of relying on a blacklist and simple tag removal, a robust HTML sanitization library should be used on the input HTML before it is processed. This would involve parsing the HTML and whitelisting allowed tags and attributes, and encoding or removing disallowed content. Libraries like `bleach` in Python are designed for this purpose. This sanitization should happen early in the processing pipeline, ideally within the `HtmlConverter` class, before further processing by the `Processor` and before generating JSON-LD.
        *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** While `HtmlSectionCleaner` removes some tags, it is not context-aware and might not be sufficient to prevent all XSS vectors. For example, it doesn't prevent attribute-based XSS (e.g., `onload` attributes in `<img>` tags, or `href` in `<a>` tags if they were not blacklisted). However, `<a>` tag is blacklisted.
        *   **Input Validation:**  There is no robust input validation to ensure that the input HTML conforms to expected structure and content.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a Content Security Policy for the preview HTML could further mitigate the impact of HTML injection. A restrictive CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts and restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded. However, this is a defense-in-depth measure and output escaping is the primary mitigation needed.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious HTML input to the converter, either via the `--html_file` or `--html_string` argument when running `main.py`.
        *   The malicious HTML input must be crafted in a way that, after being processed by the HTML to JSON-LD converter, results in malicious HTML code being placed into the `s:headline`, `s:description`, or `s:image` fields of the generated JSON-LD.
        *   The application must generate and display the HTML preview (by using `--output_html_file_path` argument, which is default).
        *   A user must open and view the generated HTML preview file in a web browser.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **`Utility/preview_html_of_json_ld.py`:**
            *   The `preview` method iterates through `json['g:showcaseBlock']` and then `showcaseBlock['s:itemListElement']`.
            *   For each item, it checks for `s:headline`, `s:description`, and `s:image` keys.
            *   If these keys exist, it calls `__preview_headline`, `__preview_sub_headline`, `__preview_description`, or `__preview_image` respectively.
            *   These `__preview_*` methods use `.format()` to embed the text directly into HTML without any encoding:

            ```python
            def __preview_headline(self, headline_text):
                return '<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Roboto;margin:12px' \
                       ';font-size:18px;font-weight:700;" >{text}</p>' \
                    .format(text=headline_text) # Vulnerable: No HTML encoding

            def __preview_sub_headline(self, sub_headline_text):
                return '<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Roboto;margin:12px' \
                       ';font-size:15px;font-weight:650;" >{text}</p>' \
                    .format(text=sub_headline_text) # Vulnerable: No HTML encoding

            def __preview_description(self, description_text):
                return '<p style=\"text-align:center;font-family:Roboto;margin:12px' \
                       ';font-size:12px;font-weight:400;\">{text}</p>' \
                    .format(text=description_text) # Vulnerable: No HTML encoding

            def __preview_image(self, image_text):
                return '<img style=\"display:block;width:100%;margin:12px;\" src=\"{' \
                       'src}\"/>'.format(src=image_text) # Vulnerable: No HTML encoding for src attribute value
            ```

        2.  **`Processor/processor.py`:**
            *   The `Processor` class extracts text content from various HTML tags.
            *   The extracted text is then placed into the JSON-LD structure.
            *   In methods like `__process_text_tag`, the text content is escaped for JSON using `text.replace('"', r'\"')`, but no HTML encoding is performed.

            ```python
            def __process_text_tag(self, tag):
                # ...
                for text in tag.findAll(string=True, recursive=False):
                    if text.strip() and not isinstance(text, Comment):
                        text = text.replace('"', r'\"') # JSON escaping, not HTML encoding
                        self.curr_text += text.strip() + ' '
                        # ...
            ```

        3.  **`Utility/html_section_cleaner.py`:**
            *   The `HtmlSectionCleaner` removes blacklisted tags and filtered classes.
            *   This provides some level of sanitization, but it is not sufficient to prevent XSS because it doesn't handle output encoding.

            ```python
            class HtmlSectionCleaner:
                def clean(self):
                    detail = self.soup.find(id=self.section)
                    if detail:
                        # Filter tags which are marked as do not display.
                        for tag in Constants.FILTER_TAGS:
                            for child in detail.findChildren(class_=tag):
                                child.decompose()

                        # Filter blacklisted tags.
                        for tag in detail(Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS):
                            tag.decompose() # Removes blacklisted tags
            ```

        4.  **`Converter/html_converter.py`**:
            - The `HtmlConverter` processes the input HTML and generates the `sanitized_json`.
            - The `sanitize` method calls `JsonSanitizer`, which only removes empty fields and lists but does not sanitize HTML content within strings in the JSON-LD.

        5.  **`main.py`**:
            - The `main` function orchestrates the conversion process.
            - It calls `PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd().preview(json=converter.sanitized_json)` to generate the preview HTML, passing the `sanitized_json` directly to the preview generation.

        **Visualization:**

        ```
        [Crafted HTML Input] --> main.py --> HtmlConverter --> BeautifulSoup --> Processor --> JSON-LD (sanitized_json - No HTML encoding)
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        v
        sanitized_json --> PreviewHtmlOfJsonLd.preview() --> [VULNERABLE HTML Generation - No HTML Encoding] --> HTML Preview Output File --> Browser (XSS)
        ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Prepare Malicious HTML Input:** Create an HTML file (e.g., `malicious.html`) with the following content.

            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Product Description</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div id="prdDetail">
                    <div>
                        <p style="font-size:18px;" class="title">Headline with XSS</p>
                        <p style="font-size:12px;">Description with XSS</p>
                        <img src="non-existent-image.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </body>
            </html>
            ```

        2.  **Run the Converter with Malicious HTML:** Execute the `main.py` script, providing the malicious HTML file as input and specifying an output HTML file.

            ```bash
            python code/main.py -f malicious.html -c prdDetail -p output_xss.html
            ```

        3.  **Open the Output HTML Preview in a Browser:** Open the generated `output_xss.html` file in a web browser.

        4.  **Verify XSS Execution:** Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" pops up in the browser. This confirms that the JavaScript code injected in the input HTML was executed when the preview HTML was rendered, demonstrating the Reflected XSS vulnerability.

*   #### Potential Bypass of HTML Sanitization via Inline Event Handlers

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `HtmlSectionCleaner` in `/code/Utility/html_section_cleaner.py` aims to sanitize HTML content by removing blacklisted tags (defined in `Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS`) and tags with specific classes (defined in `Constants.FILTER_TAGS`).
        2.  However, the current sanitization logic is limited to tag and class-based filtering. It does not remove or sanitize HTML attributes, specifically inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, etc.).
        3.  An attacker could craft a malicious HTML input containing inline event handlers within tags that are not blacklisted or filtered by class.
        4.  These inline event handlers can contain JavaScript code that will be executed when the HTML is processed or rendered, potentially bypassing the intended sanitization and leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
        5.  Although the generated output is JSON-LD, the presence of unsanitized content in the JSON-LD is a vulnerability as it violates the principle of least privilege and introduces risk if the JSON-LD is later processed in a way that could execute the injected JavaScript (though less likely in typical JSON-LD consumption scenarios, the risk exists if the JSON-LD is later used to generate HTML or other renderable content without further sanitization).

    *   **Impact:**
        - Potential bypass of HTML sanitization.
        - Although direct execution in the JSON-LD context is not the primary concern, the presence of unsanitized JavaScript code in the JSON-LD output is a vulnerability as it violates the principle of least privilege and introduces risk if the JSON-LD is later processed in a less secure manner.
        - If the JSON-LD is used to generate content for other systems that might interpret HTML or JavaScript, this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting or other client-side vulnerabilities in those systems.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - `HtmlSectionCleaner` removes blacklisted tags and tags with specific classes.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Implement more comprehensive HTML sanitization that includes removing or neutralizing inline event handlers and other potentially harmful HTML attributes.
        - Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library that is designed to prevent XSS and other HTML-based injection attacks.
        - A whitelist approach to allowed HTML tags and attributes would be more secure than a blacklist approach.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - An attacker needs to provide a malicious HTML input, either via the `--html_file` or `--html_string` argument when running `main.py`.
        - The malicious HTML input must contain inline event handlers within HTML tags that are not blacklisted or filtered by class in `HtmlSectionCleaner`.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/Utility/html_section_cleaner.py`
        - Function: `clean(self)`
        - Code snippet:
          ```python
          for tag in detail(Constants.BLACKLISTED_TAGS):
              tag.decompose()
          for tag in Constants.FILTER_TAGS:
              for child in detail.findChildren(class_=tag):
                  child.decompose()
          ```
        - The code iterates through `BLACKLISTED_TAGS` and `FILTER_TAGS` and removes matching tags or tags with matching classes.
        - It does not examine or remove HTML attributes like inline event handlers.
        - Visualization:
          ```
          HTML Input (with inline event handler) --> HtmlSectionCleaner (tag/class blacklist, attribute bypass) --> JSON-LD Output (unsanitized event handler potentially present)
          ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Create a file named `bypass_sanitization_input.html` with the following content:
            ```html
            <div id="prdDetail">
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="title"><div onclick='alert("Sanitization Bypass")'>Headline with Event Handler</div></span></p>
            </div>
            ```
        2.  Run the `main.py` script with the crafted HTML file:
            ```bash
            python code/main.py -f bypass_sanitization_input.html -c prdDetail -j output/bypass_sanitization.json -p output/preview_bypass.html
            ```
        3.  Inspect the generated JSON-LD file `output/bypass_sanitization.json`.
        4.  Check if the `onclick` attribute or the `div` tag with the `onclick` attribute is present in the JSON-LD, especially within the `s:headline` or `s:description` values. For example, the JSON-LD might contain: `"s:headline": "<div onclick='alert(\"Sanitization Bypass\")'>Headline with Event Handler</div>"`.
        5.  If the `onclick` attribute is present in the JSON-LD output, it indicates that the inline event handler was not sanitized and bypassed the current sanitization mechanisms.
