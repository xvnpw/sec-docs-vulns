### 1. Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Deserialization in `load_qmodel` and `quantized_model_from_json`

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious H5 model file.
    2. This malicious file contains specially crafted serialized Python objects embedded within the model structure, potentially within custom layers, quantizers, or other serializable components.
    3. A user loads this malicious model file using `load_qmodel` or `quantized_model_from_json` functions from the QKeras library.
    4. During the deserialization process, the Keras/TensorFlow model loading mechanism attempts to reconstruct the Python objects from the malicious file.
    5. Due to inherent vulnerabilities in Python's deserialization process (e.g., using `pickle` or `eval` under the hood within Keras/TensorFlow), the crafted serialized objects can execute arbitrary code when they are loaded, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

- Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code relies on standard Keras/TensorFlow model loading functions, which are known to be susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities when loading models from untrusted sources.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement secure deserialization practices. Instead of relying on Python's default deserialization, which can be unsafe, the library should:
        - Avoid deserializing custom Python objects from model files altogether if possible.
        - If deserialization of custom objects is necessary, implement a safe deserialization mechanism that restricts what can be deserialized and prevents code execution. This might involve using `safe_load` from `PyYAML` for YAML files if applicable, or similar safe loading mechanisms for other formats. However, for H5 files, a complete solution might require significant changes within Keras/TensorFlow itself.
        - Warn users explicitly about the security risks of loading model files from untrusted sources in the documentation.

- Preconditions:
    1. A user must download and use a malicious model file from an attacker-controlled source.
    2. The user must use the `load_qmodel` or `quantized_model_from_json` functions from the QKeras library to load the malicious model file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/qkeras/utils.py`:
        - `load_qmodel(filepath, custom_objects=None, compile=True)`: This function directly calls `tf.keras.models.load_model(filepath, custom_objects=custom_objects, compile=compile)`.  The `tf.keras.models.load_model` function, especially when loading H5 files, is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if the H5 file is maliciously crafted.
        - `quantized_model_from_json(json_string, custom_objects=None)`: This function calls `model_from_json(json_string, custom_objects=custom_objects)` which also relies on deserialization of custom objects and could be vulnerable if `json_string` is maliciously crafted (although less likely in this attack vector compared to H5 files).

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - An attacker creates a malicious H5 file (e.g., `malicious_model.h5`). This file includes a serialized Python object within the model definition that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code (e.g., using `pickle` or by exploiting Keras custom object loading).
        - The attacker hosts this malicious file on a public website or distributes it through other channels, tricking users into downloading it.
    2. **Execution:**
        - A user, intending to use a quantized model, downloads `malicious_model.h5` from the attacker's source.
        - The user executes a Python script that uses QKeras to load the model:
            ```python
            from qkeras.utils import load_qmodel
            model = load_qmodel('malicious_model.h5')
            ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - The attacker's arbitrary code executes on the user's system when `load_qmodel` deserializes the malicious content in `malicious_model.h5`. This can be verified by:
            - Observing unexpected system behavior (e.g., creation of a file, network connection to an attacker-controlled server).
            - Checking system logs for signs of malicious activity.
            - Using a debugger to step through the `load_qmodel` function and observe code execution outside the expected QKeras library scope.
