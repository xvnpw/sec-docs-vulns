* Vulnerability Name: **Malicious Fuzzer/Integration Script Injection**

* Description:
    1. An attacker, posing as a researcher or contributor, submits a pull request to the FuzzBench repository.
    2. This pull request contains a malicious fuzzer integration or a modified integration script (fuzzer.py, builder.Dockerfile, runner.Dockerfile) for an existing fuzzer.
    3. A FuzzBench project maintainer, without carefully reviewing the pull request, merges it into the main branch.
    4. A researcher, intending to integrate a new fuzzer or update an existing one, follows the FuzzBench documentation and examples, potentially using the malicious code as a template or directly using the malicious fuzzer.
    5. The researcher clones the FuzzBench repository, which now includes the malicious code.
    6. The researcher runs the integration script locally in their development environment, unknowingly executing the malicious code.

* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the researcher's local development environment. This could include:
        - Data exfiltration from the researcher's machine.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Credential theft.
        - Further attacks targeting the researcher's projects or organization.

* Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Code reviews**: The project requires code reviews for all submissions, as stated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This is intended to catch malicious code before it is merged. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the thoroughness of the reviews.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Automated security checks for integration scripts**: Implement automated checks to scan fuzzer integration scripts (fuzzer.py, Dockerfiles) for suspicious code patterns, such as:
        - Network requests to external domains (exfiltration).
        - Execution of shell commands that are not strictly necessary for fuzzer integration.
        - File system modifications outside of designated output directories.
        - Use of known malicious code snippets or libraries.
    - **Sandboxed integration environment**:  Require or strongly encourage researchers to test fuzzer integrations within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, VM) to limit the impact of potentially malicious code.
    - **Clear security guidelines for contributors**: Provide explicit security guidelines for contributors, emphasizing responsible contribution practices and warning against including any potentially harmful code.
    - **Improved code review process**: Enhance the code review process specifically for fuzzer integrations, focusing on security aspects. This might involve:
        - Dedicated security reviews for new fuzzer integrations.
        - Checklists for reviewers to ensure security-relevant aspects are covered.
        - Training for reviewers on identifying potential malicious code in integration scripts.
    - **Stricter input validation for fuzzer names**: Implement stricter validation for fuzzer names and benchmark names to prevent attempts to disguise malicious fuzzers as legitimate ones through naming conventions.

* Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to create a GitHub account and fork the FuzzBench repository.
    2. The attacker needs to craft a malicious fuzzer integration or modify an existing integration script.
    3. The attacker needs to submit a pull request with the malicious code.
    4. A FuzzBench project maintainer needs to merge the pull request without sufficient security review.
    5. A researcher needs to clone the FuzzBench repository and run the malicious integration script locally.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The project relies on the `fuzzer.py`, `builder.Dockerfile`, and `runner.Dockerfile` files within each fuzzer's directory to define the integration and execution of fuzzers.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` mentions code reviews as a mitigation, but doesn't detail specific security checks.
    - The `docs/getting-started/adding_a_new_fuzzer.md` guide encourages users to integrate fuzzers, implying they will be running code from the repository.
    - There is no automated mechanism within the provided files to validate the security of the integration scripts themselves.
    - The `generate_report.py` and analysis scripts are focused on data analysis and reporting, not on security validation of the fuzzer integrations.
    - The Dockerfiles themselves, while containing build instructions, do not inherently prevent malicious actions within the build or runner images if the integration scripts are compromised.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - As an attacker, fork the FuzzBench repository.
        - Create a new fuzzer integration (e.g., `fuzzers/malicious_fuzzer`) with a `fuzzer.py` script containing malicious code. For example, the `fuzzer.py` could contain code to exfiltrate environment variables or create a backdoor.
        - Create a `builder.Dockerfile` and `runner.Dockerfile` for the malicious fuzzer (these can be minimal).
        - Submit a pull request to the main FuzzBench repository with this malicious fuzzer, disguising it as a legitimate contribution (e.g., a new experimental fuzzer).
    2. **Trigger**:
        - Wait for a maintainer to merge the malicious pull request (this step assumes social engineering or insufficient review).
        - As a researcher, intending to integrate a new fuzzer, follow the FuzzBench guide.
        - Clone the FuzzBench repository, including the malicious fuzzer.
        - Attempt to run the malicious fuzzer integration locally, for example by using `make test-run-malicious_fuzzer-zlib_zlib_uncompress_fuzzer`.
    3. **Verification**:
        - Observe the researcher's local development environment for signs of compromise. For example, check for:
            - Unexpected network traffic originating from the researcher's machine.
            - Creation of unauthorized files or processes.
            - Exfiltration of sensitive data (if simulated).
        - If the malicious code in `fuzzers/malicious_fuzzer/fuzzer.py` was designed to create a backdoor, attempt to exploit it.
        - Confirm that the malicious actions are executed when the integration script is run locally.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker could leverage the current FuzzBench system to inject and execute malicious code within a researcher's environment, highlighting the vulnerability and the need for improved mitigations.
