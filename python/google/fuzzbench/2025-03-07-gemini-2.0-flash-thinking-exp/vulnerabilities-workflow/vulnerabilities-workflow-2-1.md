- vulnerability name: Fuzzer Optimization for Malicious Use
- description: An attacker can utilize FuzzBench to enhance and fine-tune a fuzzer specifically for discovering vulnerabilities in software. By leveraging FuzzBench's resources and benchmarks, an attacker can iteratively improve their fuzzer's effectiveness in finding bugs, effectively weaponizing it for offensive purposes. This process involves submitting a fuzzer to FuzzBench, reviewing the comprehensive reports generated, and using these insights to optimize the fuzzer's algorithms, coverage, and efficiency against real-world benchmarks. Through repeated submissions and optimizations, the attacker can create a highly potent vulnerability discovery tool, ready to be deployed against target software, potentially leading to zero-day exploits.
- impact: High. A highly optimized fuzzer, specifically trained on FuzzBench's extensive benchmarks, can be used to discover zero-day vulnerabilities in software similar to those benchmarks. This can lead to widespread exploitation before patches are available, causing significant harm.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations:
  - The project is designed as a benchmarking service for fuzzers, with the primary goal of improving fuzzing research and adoption within the security community.
  - There are no specific technical mitigations within the project to prevent the described attack vector, as the platform is intentionally designed to rigorously evaluate and improve fuzzers.
- missing mitigations:
  - There are no feasible technical mitigations within the design of FuzzBench to prevent this attack vector, as the service is inherently built to improve fuzzer performance. Mitigations would fundamentally alter the purpose of FuzzBench.
- preconditions:
  - An attacker needs access to the FuzzBench platform, which is publicly accessible.
  - The attacker needs a basic understanding of fuzzing and the ability to modify and integrate a fuzzer with the FuzzBench API.
- source code analysis:
  - The provided PROJECT FILES are mostly documentation and configuration, and do not directly reveal specific code vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a traditional sense. The "vulnerability" here is at the architectural and intended use level.
  - The `README.md` and documentation files explicitly state the purpose of FuzzBench is to "rigorously evaluate fuzzing research and make fuzzing research easier". The service is designed to provide "an easy API for integrating fuzzers" and "benchmarks from real-world projects", directly facilitating the attack vector.
  - The overview diagram `docs/images/FuzzBench-service.png` illustrates the workflow: fuzzer integration, experiment execution, and report generation. This entire workflow is available to any user, including malicious actors.
  - Files in `/code/fuzzers/` and `/code/benchmarks/` directories demonstrate the ease of integrating various fuzzers and benchmarks, further highlighting the accessibility of the platform for optimization purposes.
- security test case:
  - Vulnerability Name: Fuzzer Optimization for Malicious Use
  - Test Case Steps:
    1. An attacker registers for a FuzzBench account (if registration is required; if not, they access the public instance).
    2. The attacker integrates a basic, publicly available fuzzer (e.g., a slightly modified version of AFL or LibFuzzer) into FuzzBench, following the provided integration guide (e.g., `docs/getting-started/adding-a-new-fuzzer.md`).
    3. The attacker submits their fuzzer integration as a pull request, getting it accepted into the FuzzBench repository.
    4. The attacker requests an experiment on FuzzBench, including their fuzzer and a selection of benchmarks relevant to their target software.
    5. Once the experiment is complete, the attacker analyzes the generated report (e.g., `reports/sample/index.html` or custom reports generated using `analysis/generate_report.py`). They identify areas where their fuzzer performs poorly compared to others.
    6. Based on the report's insights (coverage graphs, ranking, statistical tests), the attacker modifies their fuzzer to improve its performance on the identified weaknesses. This could involve:
        - Adapting mutation strategies to better target uncovered code paths.
        - Incorporating techniques from higher-ranking fuzzers in the report.
        - Optimizing seed scheduling or power schedules.
    7. The attacker repeats steps 2-6 iteratively, each time submitting an improved version of their fuzzer and running new experiments, until they achieve a highly effective fuzzer against the chosen benchmarks.
    8. The attacker then deploys the optimized fuzzer against their actual target software, which is similar in nature to the benchmarks used on FuzzBench, increasing their chances of finding zero-day vulnerabilities.
  - Expected Result: The attacker successfully uses FuzzBench to significantly improve the performance of their fuzzer. The reports generated by FuzzBench provide actionable intelligence for fuzzer optimization. The attacker can then leverage this optimized fuzzer outside of FuzzBench for malicious purposes.
  - Pass/Fail Criteria: The vulnerability is considered valid if the attacker can demonstrably use FuzzBench to improve a fuzzer's performance to a degree that it becomes a more effective vulnerability discovery tool. This is inherently demonstrable through the design of FuzzBench itself, as its purpose is to showcase and quantify fuzzer improvements.
