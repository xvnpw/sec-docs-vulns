## Vulnerability List:

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Insecure Fuzzer Execution via `fuzzer.py` leading to Sandbox Escape

- Description:
    1. An attacker submits a malicious fuzzer to the FuzzBench platform.
    2. The attacker crafts a `fuzzer.py` file within their fuzzer submission.
    3. This malicious `fuzzer.py` contains Python code designed to escape the sandboxed execution environment during the fuzzing stage.
    4. When FuzzBench executes the experiment involving this malicious fuzzer, the `fuzzer.py` script is run within the runner container.
    5. The malicious code in `fuzzer.py` leverages potential vulnerabilities in the container configuration or Python libraries to break out of the sandbox.
    6. Upon successful escape, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the FuzzBench infrastructure or the benchmark targets.

- Impact:
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escape the container sandbox.
    - **Confidentiality:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the FuzzBench infrastructure, including experiment configurations, benchmark data, and potentially credentials.
    - **Integrity:** The attacker can modify FuzzBench infrastructure, manipulate benchmark results, or inject malicious code into the system.
    - **Availability:** The attacker can disrupt the FuzzBench service, potentially leading to denial of service or data corruption.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Sandboxing via Docker:** FuzzBench uses Docker containers to sandbox fuzzer execution. However, the provided files do not contain details about specific security configurations applied to these containers to prevent escape attempts from within `fuzzer.py`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all submitted fuzzer components, including `fuzzer.py`, to detect and block potentially malicious code patterns.
    - **Restricted Execution Environment for `fuzzer.py`:** Execute `fuzzer.py` in a highly restricted environment with minimal privileges, limited system calls, and no network access to minimize the attack surface for sandbox escape attempts. Consider using secure sandboxing technologies beyond standard Docker configurations.
    - **Code Review and Static Analysis of `fuzzer.py`:** Implement mandatory code review and static analysis checks for submitted `fuzzer.py` files to identify suspicious or potentially malicious code before deployment.
    - **System Call Filtering:** Implement system call filtering within the runner containers to restrict the actions that `fuzzer.py` can perform, preventing common sandbox escape techniques.
    - **Capabilities Dropping:** Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities within the runner containers to limit the privileges available to `fuzzer.py`.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the FuzzBench platform to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to fuzzer execution.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker has successfully submitted a malicious fuzzer to the FuzzBench platform.
    - The malicious fuzzer submission has been accepted by the FuzzBench maintainers (if manual review is in place, this precondition might be harder to meet, but automated systems might be more vulnerable).
    - The FuzzBench platform executes an experiment that includes the malicious fuzzer.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/fuzzers/runner.Dockerfile` and `/code/docker/benchmark-runner/Dockerfile`**: Examine these Dockerfiles to understand the environment in which `fuzzer.py` is executed. Look for:
        - Base images used: Are they minimal and secure? (`gcr.io/fuzzbench/base-image` seems to be the base image, need to analyze its security posture).
        - Privileged operations: Are there any `RUN` commands that install potentially vulnerable packages or configure the environment insecurely? (Files show installation of `libglib2.0-0`, `libxml2`, `libarchive13`, `libgss3` - these might have vulnerabilities).
        - User context: Under what user is `fuzzer.py` executed within the container? (Files suggest root user context in Dockerfiles, which is not ideal for security).
    2. **File: `/code/fuzzers/fuzzer.py` (template) and example fuzzer implementations (`/code/fuzzers/afl/fuzzer.py` etc.)**: Analyze the structure of `fuzzer.py` and the `fuzz()` function, which is user-defined code.
        - Execution context of `fuzz()`: How is the `fuzz()` function executed? Are there any security boundaries enforced during its execution? (Files indicate `fuzz()` is executed via `subprocess.call`, need to check if this execution is sandboxed).
        - Access to resources: What resources (file system, network, system calls) are available to the `fuzz()` function? (Files show access to input and output corpora, target binary, potentially more).
    3. **File: `/code/experiment/runner.py`**: Analyze the `runner.py` script, specifically the `fuzz` function execution part.
        - Sandbox implementation: How does `runner.py` sandbox the `fuzz()` function? (Files don't show explicit sandboxing beyond Docker itself, which might be insufficient).
        - Security measures: Are there any attempts to limit capabilities, system calls, or access to resources for the `fuzz()` function within `runner.py`? (Files do not reveal any specific capability dropping or syscall filtering).

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a malicious `fuzzer.py`:** Craft a `fuzzer.py` script that attempts to escape the Docker sandbox. Example malicious code could include:
        ```python
        import os
        import subprocess

        def fuzz(input_corpus, output_corpus, target_binary):
            # Attempt to escape Docker by mounting host filesystem (example, might not work directly due to container configuration)
            subprocess.call(['mount', '--bind', '/', '/host_fs'], shell=True)
            # Attempt to execute commands on the host system (example, might not work due to limited capabilities)
            subprocess.call(['chroot', '/host_fs', '/bin/bash', '-c', 'whoami > /output/evil.txt'], shell=True)
        ```
    2. **Submit the malicious fuzzer:** Package the malicious `fuzzer.py` along with other necessary files (Dockerfile, description.md) into a fuzzer submission.
    3. **Run an experiment with the malicious fuzzer:** Create an experiment configuration that includes the malicious fuzzer and a benchmark.
    4. **Monitor the FuzzBench infrastructure:** After the experiment starts, monitor the FuzzBench infrastructure for signs of sandbox escape, such as:
        - Unauthorized access to the file system outside the container.
        - Unexpected processes running on the FuzzBench host system.
        - Modification of FuzzBench system files or configurations.
        - Network connections originating from the runner container to unexpected destinations.
    5. **Analyze the report and logs:** Examine the generated report and fuzzer logs for any evidence of successful or attempted sandbox escape. Check for error messages, unusual activity, or unexpected behavior.
    6. **(Optional) Refine the exploit:** If the initial attempt is unsuccessful, refine the malicious `fuzzer.py` code to bypass existing sandbox mitigations and try different escape techniques. Repeat steps 3-5 until successful sandbox escape is achieved or all feasible attempts are exhausted.
