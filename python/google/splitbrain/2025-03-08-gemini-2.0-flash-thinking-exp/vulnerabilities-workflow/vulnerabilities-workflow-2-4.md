## Vulnerability List

### 1. Protobuf Text Format Parsing Vulnerability

* **Description:**
    1. The Splitbrain tool reads a graph definition from a file specified by the `--input_path` argument in `main.py`.
    2. The `graphdef_utils.load_graphdef_from_file` function is used to load this file.
    3. This function uses `google.protobuf.text_format.Parse` to parse the content of the file, which is expected to be in protobuf text format, into a `program_graph_pb2.GraphDef` object.
    4. If the `google.protobuf.text_format.Parse` function has any parsing vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues when handling maliciously crafted input), an attacker could exploit them.
    5. An attacker can craft a malicious textproto file and provide its path as `--input_path` to the `main.py` script.
    6. When `text_format.Parse` processes this malicious file, it could trigger the vulnerability.
    7. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running the Splitbrain tool.

* **Impact:**
    * Arbitrary code execution on the researcher's machine.
    * An attacker could gain complete control over the researcher's system.
    * Potential for data theft, malware installation, or further malicious activities.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * None. The code directly uses `text_format.Parse` without any input validation or sanitization of the input file content.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement validation of the parsed `GraphDef` object after parsing. This should include checks for:
        * Reasonable size limits for the graph (number of nodes and edges).
        * Limits on the depth of nested structures within the protobuf.
        * Validation of field values to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.
    * **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the `graphdef_utils.load_graphdef_from_file` and subsequent graph processing steps in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    * **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update the `protobuf` library to the latest version to ensure that known parsing vulnerabilities are patched.
    * **Use Binary Protobuf Format:** Consider using binary protobuf format instead of text format. Binary format is generally harder to manually craft for exploits and might have a smaller attack surface in terms of parsing vulnerabilities, although this is not a guaranteed mitigation.

* **Preconditions:**
    * An attacker must be able to provide a malicious textproto file as input to the Splitbrain tool. This could be achieved if the tool processes user-provided or externally sourced graph definition files, for example, as part of processing a code diff.
    * The researcher must execute the Splitbrain tool (`main.py`) with the attacker-controlled malicious input file path via the `--input_path` flag.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    * **File:** `/code/graphdef_utils.py`
    * **Function:** `load_graphdef_from_file`
    * **Vulnerable Line:**
        ```python
        text_format.Parse(f.read(), graphdef)
        ```
    * **Explanation:** The `text_format.Parse` function from the `google.protobuf` library is directly used to parse the input file content into a `GraphDef` protobuf message. If this parsing function has vulnerabilities, then processing a malicious input file will trigger them. There is no input validation performed before or after this parsing step to mitigate potential exploits.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Craft a Malicious Textproto File:** Create a text file named `malicious_graph.textproto` containing a specially crafted protobuf message designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in `text_format.Parse`. This might involve:
        * Creating very long strings for string fields.
        * Deeply nesting messages.
        * Using large numerical values where they might cause overflows.
        * Exploiting any known vulnerabilities in protobuf text parsing if publicly disclosed.
        * As a starting point for testing, you could try creating a very large number of symbols or edges in the graph definition to see if it causes resource exhaustion or parsing errors.

        ```textproto
        symbol {
          name: "A"
          u_edge: "B"
          ... (repeat u_edge many times, or create a very long name) ...
        }
        ... (repeat symbol block many times) ...
        ```

    2. **Run Splitbrain with Malicious Input:** Execute the `main.py` script, providing the path to the `malicious_graph.textproto` file using the `--input_path` flag:
        ```bash
        python3 /code/main.py --input_path=/path/to/malicious_graph.textproto
        ```
        Replace `/path/to/malicious_graph.textproto` with the actual path to your malicious file.

    3. **Observe System Behavior:** Monitor the execution of the `main.py` script. Check for:
        * **Crashes:** Does the script crash with a segmentation fault or other error?
        * **Error Messages:** Are there any error messages related to protobuf parsing or memory allocation?
        * **Resource Exhaustion:** Does the script consume excessive CPU or memory?
        * **Arbitrary Code Execution (if possible to craft exploit):** If you are able to craft a more sophisticated exploit, try to trigger arbitrary code execution. For example, attempt to execute a simple command like `touch /tmp/pwned` and check if the file is created. You might need to investigate known protobuf vulnerabilities or perform fuzzing to discover exploitable parsing flaws.

    4. **Analyze Results:** If the test case leads to a crash, error, or unexpected behavior, it indicates a potential vulnerability. Further investigation and debugging would be required to confirm the nature and severity of the vulnerability and whether it can be exploited for arbitrary code execution. If you can reliably trigger a crash or resource exhaustion with a crafted input, it demonstrates a vulnerability in the input processing.
