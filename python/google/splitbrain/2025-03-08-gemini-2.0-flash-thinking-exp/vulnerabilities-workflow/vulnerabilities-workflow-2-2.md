### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via Malicious GraphDef Filenames in Git Command Generation
  - **Description**:
    1. The `_make_git_from_cls` function in `main.py` is intended to generate a series of git commands to apply the split changelists.
    2. Currently, the filepath used in `git add` command is hardcoded as `"path/to/file"`. However, there is a TODO comment indicating that this filepath should be dynamically obtained from the symbol table, which is derived from the input `GraphDef`.
    3. If the filepath is constructed using a field from the `NodeDef` (e.g., `symbol.name`) without proper sanitization, a malicious user could craft a `GraphDef` input file where a `NodeDef`'s `name` field contains shell command injection payloads.
    4. When `_make_git_from_cls` processes this malicious `GraphDef` and generates git commands, the unsanitized node name would be inserted into the `git add` command.
    5. If the system executes these generated git commands (e.g., by piping the output of `main.py --git` to `bash`), the injected shell commands would be executed.
  - **Impact**:
    - Code execution on the machine running Splitbrain. An attacker could gain control of the system by injecting arbitrary shell commands.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - Currently, the filepath is hardcoded in `_make_git_from_cls` function, which prevents this specific vulnerability. However, this is not a proper mitigation, but rather an incomplete feature.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    - Input sanitization for node names (and any other fields from `GraphDef` that are used to construct shell commands) before using them in `git add` or other shell commands.
    - Proper parameterization of shell commands to prevent command injection instead of string concatenation.
  - **Preconditions**:
    - The `_make_git_from_cls` function needs to be completed to dynamically fetch filepaths from the `GraphDef` data based on the TODO comment.
    - The user must execute the generated git commands, for example by piping the output of `main.py --git` to `bash`.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. Open `main.py` and examine the `_make_git_from_cls` function:
    ```python
    def _make_git_from_cls(CLs: list, graphdef: program_graph_pb2.GraphDef) -> str:
        # TODO(cameron): Ensure cannot build if doesn't fit constraints.
        # TODO(cameron): Move to another file, add tests.

        out = "git rebase -i <oldsha1>\n"  # TODO(cameron): Pass in via CLI.
        out += "git reset HEAD^\n"
        for CL in CLs:
            for symbol in CL:
                del symbol
                filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.
                out += f"git add {filepath}\n"
            commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!"  # TODO(cameron): Generate description.
            out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"

        out += "git rebase --continue"
        return out
    ```
    - Line `filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.` shows that the filepath is currently hardcoded. The comment indicates that this is a placeholder and the filepath should be dynamically fetched from the symbol table in the future.
    - If the `TODO` is implemented by directly using a field from `NodeDef` (like `symbol.name`) without sanitization in the `filepath` variable, it would lead to command injection.

  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Create a file named `malicious_graph.textproto` with the following content:
    ```textproto
    symbol {
      name: "$(touch /tmp/pwned)"
      kind: SYMBOL
    }
    ```
    2. Modify `main.py` to simulate fetching filepath from `symbol.name` in `_make_git_from_cls` function and to handle symbol names instead of objects in CLs. Also modify `NullAlgorithm` to return symbol names.  (Code modifications are described in detail in the thought process).
    3. Run the modified `main.py` with the malicious input and `--git` flag and pipe the output to `bash`:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py --input_path=malicious_graph.textproto --git --quiet | bash
    ```
    4. Check if the command injection was successful by verifying if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists:
    ```bash
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```
    - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful due to the malicious node name being used in the `git add` command.
