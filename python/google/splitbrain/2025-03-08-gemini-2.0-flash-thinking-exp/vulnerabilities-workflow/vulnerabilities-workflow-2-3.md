#### 1. Command Injection in Git Command Generation

* Description:
    1. The `_make_git_from_cls` function in `main.py` generates a series of git commands to apply the split changelists.
    2. Currently, the `filepath` and `commit_message` in these commands are hardcoded.
    3. However, there are `TODO` comments indicating that these values are intended to be dynamically generated from the symbol table in the future.
    4. If the `filepath` is derived from user-controlled input, such as the `symbol.name` in the input graph, and not properly sanitized, an attacker could craft a malicious input graph.
    5. This malicious graph could contain `symbol.name` values with shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, etc.).
    6. When `_make_git_from_cls` generates the `git add {filepath}` command using the unsanitized `filepath`, it could lead to command injection.
    7. For example, if a `symbol.name` is set to `file.txt; touch injected.txt`, the generated command would be `git add file.txt; touch injected.txt`, which would execute the `touch injected.txt` command after adding `file.txt`.

* Impact:
    - **High**. Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or the user's machine where the `splitbrain.py` script is executed with the `--git` flag.
    - This could lead to various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Hardcoded filepath and commit message**: Currently, the `filepath` (`"path/to/file"`) and `commit_message` (`"SplitBrain Commit!!!"`) are hardcoded in `_make_git_from_cls` in `main.py`. This prevents command injection for now as the values are not taken from user input.
    - Location: `/code/main.py`

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input sanitization**: When dynamically generating `filepath` and `commit_message` from user-controlled input (e.g., symbol table), proper sanitization of these values is missing.
    - **Secure command execution**: Instead of directly embedding potentially unsafe strings into shell commands, using secure command execution methods that prevent injection (e.g., using parameterized commands or escaping shell metacharacters) is missing.

* Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input graph to Splitbrain.
    2. The `--git` flag must be used when running `main.py` to trigger the vulnerable code path in `_make_git_from_cls`.
    3. The `filepath` in `_make_git_from_cls` needs to be dynamically generated from user-controlled input, as indicated by the `TODO` comment. (Currently, this precondition is not fully met because filepath is hardcoded, but the code is intended to be changed to use dynamic filepath, creating the vulnerability).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/main.py`
    - Function: `_make_git_from_cls(CLs: list, graphdef: program_graph_pb2.GraphDef) -> str`
    ```python
    def _make_git_from_cls(CLs: list, graphdef: program_graph_pb2.GraphDef) -> str:
      # TODO(cameron): Ensure cannot build if doesn't fit constraints.
      # TODO(cameron): Move to another file, add tests.

      out = "git rebase -i <oldsha1>\n"  # TODO(cameron): Pass in via CLI.
      out += "git reset HEAD^\n"
      for CL in CLs:
        for symbol in CL:
          del symbol
          filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.
          out += f"git add {filepath}\n"
        commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!"  # TODO(cameron): Generate description.
        out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"

      out += "git rebase --continue"
      return out
    ```
    - Line 63: `filepath = "path/to/file"` - This line shows the hardcoded filepath, but the comment `TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.` indicates future intent to dynamically generate this from the symbol table, which can be influenced by the input graph.
    - Line 65: `out += f"git add {filepath}\n"` - This line constructs the `git add` command using an f-string. If `filepath` is dynamically generated and contains malicious shell metacharacters, this line will be vulnerable to command injection.
    - Line 67: `commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!"` - This line shows the hardcoded commit message, but the comment `TODO(cameron): Generate description.` indicates future intent to dynamically generate this.
    - Line 68: `out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"` - This line constructs the `git commit -m` command using an f-string. If `commit_message` is dynamically generated and contains malicious shell metacharacters, this line will be vulnerable to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious input graph textproto file (e.g., `malicious_graph.textproto`) with a symbol that has a malicious name designed for command injection. For example:
    ```textproto
    symbol {
      name: "file.txt; touch injected_filepath.txt"
      kind: SYMBOL
    }
    ```
    2. Run `main.py` with the `--git` flag and the malicious input graph file:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py --input_path=malicious_graph.textproto --git
    ```
    3. Before running, ensure there is no file named `injected_filepath.txt` in the current directory.
    4. After running the command, check if a file named `injected_filepath.txt` has been created in the current directory.
    5. If `injected_filepath.txt` is created, it indicates that the command injection through the filepath in `git add` was successful.
    6. To test commit message injection, create another malicious input graph (e.g., `malicious_graph_commit.textproto`):
    ```textproto
    symbol {
      name: "file.txt"
      kind: SYMBOL
    }
    ```
    And modify `main.py` temporarily to use symbol name as commit message (for testing purposes only, remove after test):
    ```diff
    --- a/code/main.py
    +++ b/code/main.py
    @@ -65,7 +65,7 @@
           filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.
           out += f"git add {filepath}\n"
         commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!"  # TODO(cameron): Generate description.
-        out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"
+        out += f"git commit -m 'Commit message injection test: '; touch injected_commit.txt;'\n"

       out += "git rebase --continue"
       return out
    ```
    7. Run `main.py` with the modified code and `--git` flag:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py --input_path=malicious_graph_commit.textproto --git
    ```
    8. Before running, ensure there is no file named `injected_commit.txt` in the current directory.
    9. After running, check if `injected_commit.txt` is created. If yes, commit message injection is successful.

**Note**: This vulnerability is currently potential as the vulnerable code path (dynamic filepath/commit message generation) is not yet implemented, but is clearly indicated as future work in the code comments. If the `TODO` items are implemented without proper sanitization, this vulnerability will become real.
