## Vulnerability List

### 1. Command Injection via Malicious GraphDef Filenames in Git Command Generation

*   **Description:**
    1.  The `_make_git_from_cls` function in `main.py` is intended to generate a series of git commands to apply the split changelists.
    2.  Currently, the filepath used in `git add` command is hardcoded as `"path/to/file"`. However, there is a `TODO` comment indicating that this filepath should be dynamically obtained from the symbol table, which is derived from the input `GraphDef`.
    3.  If the filepath is constructed using a field from the `NodeDef` (e.g., `symbol.name`) without proper sanitization, a malicious user could craft a `GraphDef` input file where a `NodeDef`'s `name` field contains shell command injection payloads.
    4.  When `_make_git_from_cls` processes this malicious `GraphDef` and generates git commands, the unsanitized node name would be inserted into the `git add` command.
    5.  If the system executes these generated git commands (e.g., by piping the output of `main.py --git` to `bash` or by copy-pasting), the injected shell commands would be executed on the developer's machine.
    6.  This vulnerability also applies to the commit message, which is currently hardcoded but is intended to be dynamically generated from user-controlled input as indicated by a `TODO` comment. Unsanitized commit messages could also lead to command injection if mishandled (though less likely in typical `git commit -m` usage, it's still a potential risk if commit messages are processed in other contexts).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine when they use Splitbrain with a malicious input graph and use the `--git` flag and execute the generated commands. An attacker could gain control of the system by injecting arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Currently, the filepath is hardcoded in `_make_git_from_cls` function, which prevents this specific vulnerability in its current state. However, this is not a proper mitigation, but rather an incomplete feature.
    *   Location: `/code/main.py`

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization for node names (and any other fields from `GraphDef` that are used to construct shell commands like filepaths or commit messages) before using them in `git add` or other shell commands. Specifically, filepaths and commit messages should be validated to only contain valid characters and not include command separators like `;` or `&` or shell metacharacters.
    *   Proper parameterization of shell commands to prevent command injection instead of string concatenation. Using libraries or functions that handle command execution with proper escaping or parameterization would be a more secure approach.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The `_make_git_from_cls` function needs to be completed to dynamically fetch filepaths and potentially commit messages from the `GraphDef` data based on the `TODO` comments.
    *   The user must execute the generated git commands, for example by piping the output of `main.py --git` to `bash` or by manually copy-pasting and executing them.
    *   Attacker can craft a malicious `GraphDef` file.
    *   User runs `main.py` with `--git` flag and provides the malicious `GraphDef` as input using `--input_path`.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   File: `/code/main.py`
    *   Function: `_make_git_from_cls(CLs: list, graphdef: program_graph_pb2.GraphDef) -> str`
        ```python
        def _make_git_from_cls(CLs: list, graphdef: program_graph_pb2.GraphDef) -> str:
          # TODO(cameron): Ensure cannot build if doesn't fit constraints.
          # TODO(cameron): Move to another file, add tests.

          out = "git rebase -i <oldsha1>\n"  # TODO(cameron): Pass in via CLI.
          out += "git reset HEAD^\n"
          for CL in CLs:
            for symbol in CL:
              del symbol
              filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.
              out += f"git add {filepath}\n"
            commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!"  # TODO(cameron): Generate description.
            out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"

          out += "git rebase --continue"
          return out
        ```
        *   Line `filepath = "path/to/file"  # TODO(cameron): Grab from symbol table.` shows that the filepath is currently hardcoded. The comment indicates that this is a placeholder and the filepath should be dynamically fetched from the symbol table in the future.
        *   Line `commit_message = "SplitBrain Commit!!!" # TODO(cameron): Generate description.` shows that the commit message is currently hardcoded and should be dynamically generated in the future.
        *   Lines like `out += f"git add {filepath}\n"` and `out += f"git commit -m {commit_message}\n"` construct git commands using f-strings. If `filepath` or `commit_message` are dynamically generated from user-controlled input without sanitization, these lines will be vulnerable to command injection.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a file named `malicious_graph.textproto` with the following content. This crafted `GraphDef` includes a symbol with a name designed to inject a command when used as a filepath.
        ```textproto
        symbol {
          name: "file.txt; touch /tmp/pwned"
          kind: SYMBOL
        }
        ```
    2.  Run `main.py` with the `--git` flag and specify the malicious graph file as input:
        ```bash
        bazel run //code:splitbrain -- --git --input_path=malicious_graph.textproto
        ```
    3.  Copy the output from the command. It will look similar to this (the `<oldsha1>` will be placeholder):
        ```text
        git rebase -i <oldsha1>
        git reset HEAD^
        git add file.txt; touch /tmp/pwned
        git commit -m SplitBrain Commit!!!
        git rebase --continue
        ```
    4.  Paste and execute these git commands in a terminal within a git repository.
    5.  After executing the commands, check if a file named `pwned` exists in the `/tmp/` directory. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present, as the `touch /tmp/pwned` command embedded in the filepath was executed by `git add`.

### 2. Protobuf Text Format Parsing Vulnerability

*   **Description:**
    1.  The Splitbrain tool reads a graph definition from a file specified by the `--input_path` argument in `main.py`.
    2.  The `graphdef_utils.load_graphdef_from_file` function is used to load this file.
    3.  This function uses `google.protobuf.text_format.Parse` to parse the content of the file, which is expected to be in protobuf text format, into a `program_graph_pb2.GraphDef` object.
    4.  If the `google.protobuf.text_format.Parse` function has any parsing vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues when handling maliciously crafted input), an attacker could exploit them.
    5.  An attacker can craft a malicious textproto file and provide its path as `--input_path` to the `main.py` script.
    6.  When `text_format.Parse` processes this malicious file, it could trigger the vulnerability.
    7.  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running the Splitbrain tool.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the researcher's machine.
    *   An attacker could gain complete control over the researcher's system.
    *   Potential for data theft, malware installation, or further malicious activities.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly uses `text_format.Parse` without any input validation or sanitization of the input file content.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement validation of the parsed `GraphDef` object after parsing. This should include checks for reasonable size limits, limits on nesting depth, and validation of field values.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the graph parsing and processing in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update the `protobuf` library to the latest version.
    *   **Consider Binary Protobuf Format:** Using binary protobuf format may reduce the attack surface compared to text format.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   An attacker must be able to provide a malicious textproto file as input to the Splitbrain tool via `--input_path`.
    *   The researcher must execute the Splitbrain tool (`main.py`) with the attacker-controlled malicious input file path.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **File:** `/code/graphdef_utils.py`
    *   **Function:** `load_graphdef_from_file`
    *   **Vulnerable Line:**
        ```python
        text_format.Parse(f.read(), graphdef)
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** The `text_format.Parse` function from the `google.protobuf` library is used without any prior input validation. This makes the application vulnerable to any parsing vulnerabilities present in the `protobuf` library when processing a malicious input file.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Craft a Malicious Textproto File:** Create `malicious_graph.textproto` with content designed to trigger potential parsing vulnerabilities in `text_format.Parse`. This could include very large messages, deeply nested structures, excessively long strings, or other malformed data.
        ```textproto
        symbol {
          name: "A"
          u_edge: "B"
          ... (repeat u_edge many times, or create a very long name) ...
        }
        ... (repeat symbol block many times) ...
        ```

    2.  **Run Splitbrain with Malicious Input:** Execute `main.py` with the crafted malicious input file:
        ```bash
        python3 /code/main.py --input_path=/path/to/malicious_graph.textproto
        ```

    3.  **Observe System Behavior:** Monitor for crashes, errors, resource exhaustion, or unexpected behavior during script execution.

    4.  **Analyze Results:** If the test leads to crashes, errors, or resource exhaustion, it indicates a potential vulnerability in protobuf parsing. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact nature and exploitability of the vulnerability.
