Based on the provided instructions, I need to evaluate if the given vulnerability "Configuration File Injection" should be included in the output list. The criteria for exclusion include vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity.

The provided vulnerability is ranked as "Medium" severity. According to the instructions:

"Exclude vulnerabilities that:
- are not high or critical severity."

Since the vulnerability is ranked as "Medium", it falls under the exclusion criteria.

Therefore, the vulnerability should be excluded, and the output should be an empty list.
