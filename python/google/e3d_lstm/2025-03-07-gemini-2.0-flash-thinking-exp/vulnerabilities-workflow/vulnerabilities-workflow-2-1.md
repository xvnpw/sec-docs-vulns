- Vulnerability Name: Image File Processing Vulnerability in KTH Dataset Loading
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries like PIL or OpenCV.
  2. The attacker provides a path to a directory containing this malicious image file as input to the E3D-LSTM model, specifically targeting the KTH dataset loading process. This could be achieved by modifying the `--train_data_paths` or `--valid_data_paths` arguments in the training or testing scripts.
  3. When the application loads the KTH dataset, the `DataProcess.load_data` function in `src/data_provider/kth_action.py` is executed.
  4. Inside `load_data`, for each file identified as an image, the application uses `PIL.Image.open()` to open the image file.
  5. The opened image is then converted to a NumPy array using `np.array(frame_im)`.
  6. Subsequently, `cv2.resize()` is used to resize the image to a fixed dimension.
  7. If the malicious image file is processed by vulnerable versions of `PIL.Image.open()`, `np.array()`, or `cv2.resize()`, it can trigger a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow or arbitrary code execution.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the machine running the E3D-LSTM model.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code does not include any input validation or sanitization for image files processed from the KTH dataset.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation: Implement checks to validate the format, size, and content of image files before processing them with image libraries. This could include verifying file headers and using safer image decoding methods if available.
  - Secure image processing: Consider using safer alternatives to `PIL` and `OpenCV` if available, or ensure that the versions of these libraries are patched against known vulnerabilities.
  - Sandboxing: Isolate the image processing operations within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
  - Filesystem permissions: Implement strict filesystem permissions to limit where the application can read data from, reducing the risk of an attacker providing a path to a malicious dataset.
- Preconditions:
  - The E3D-LSTM model must be configured to process the KTH dataset. This is typically done by specifying the dataset path via command-line arguments when running the training or testing scripts.
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide a path to a directory containing the malicious image files. This might involve social engineering, exploiting configuration weaknesses, or compromising the system to modify the dataset path.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/data_provider/kth_action.py`
  - Function: `DataProcess.load_data(self, paths, mode='train')`
  ```python
  def load_data(self, paths, mode='train'):
      ...
      for cur_file in filelist:  # image_0257
        if not cur_file.startswith('image'):
          continue

        frame_im = Image.open(os.path.join(dir_path, cur_file)) # Vulnerable point: PIL.Image.open - potential vulnerability in image decoding.
        frame_np = np.array(frame_im)  # Vulnerable point: np.array - potential vulnerability during array conversion triggered by malformed image from PIL.
        frame_np = frame_np[:, :, 0]
        frames_np.append(frame_np)
        frames_file_name.append(cur_file)
        frames_person_mark.append(person_mark)
        frames_category.append(frame_category_flag)
      ...
      frames_np = np.asarray(frames_np)
      data = np.zeros((frames_np.shape[0], self.image_width, self.image_width, 1))
      for i in range(len(frames_np)):
        temp = np.float32(frames_np[i, :, :])
        data[i, :, :, 0] = cv2.resize(temp, (self.image_width, self.image_width)) / 255 # Vulnerable point: cv2.resize - potential vulnerability in image resizing with OpenCV.
      ...
  ```
  The code snippet above shows the vulnerable section within the `load_data` function. The lines using `Image.open`, `np.array`, and `cv2.resize` are where a maliciously crafted image could exploit underlying vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries. These functions are known to have had vulnerabilities in the past, and without proper input validation, they represent a critical security risk.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prepare a Malicious Image:** Create a specially crafted PNG image file (e.g., `malicious.png`) designed to exploit a known vulnerability in either `PIL.Image.open` or `cv2.resize`. Publicly available resources or security tools can be used to generate such a file, targeting known vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or heap overflows in image decoding or processing libraries.
  2. **Create Malicious Dataset Directory:** Construct a directory structure that mimics the KTH dataset format. Within this structure, place the `malicious.png` file in a location where image files are expected to be loaded. For example: `kth_malicious/boxing/person01_boxing_d1_uncomp/malicious.png`. To ensure the loading process proceeds without file name errors, rename other valid KTH dataset images to filenames like `image_0001.png`, `image_0002.png`, and place them in the same directory as `malicious.png`.
  3. **Modify Script to Use Malicious Dataset:** Edit one of the provided training or testing scripts, such as `scripts/e3d_lstm_kth_train.sh` or `scripts/e3d_lstm_kth_test.sh`. Modify the command-line arguments to point to the newly created malicious dataset directory. Specifically, change the `--train_data_paths` or `--valid_data_paths` argument to the path of `kth_malicious`.
  4. **Run the Modified Script:** Execute the modified script.
  5. **Observe for Code Execution or Crash:** Monitor the execution of the script. A successful exploit will manifest as arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to run commands on the system. Alternatively, the exploit might cause the application to crash due to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues. If either of these outcomes is observed, it confirms the presence of the image processing vulnerability.
