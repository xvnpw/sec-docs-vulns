### Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Pre-trained Model

* Description:
    1. The LASSIE application loads a pre-trained model from the file path specified by `cfg.vae_model_path` in `main/config.py`. This path defaults to `model_dump/primitive_decoder.pth`.
    2. The `PartVAE.load_model` function in `/code/networks/part_vae.py` uses `torch.load()` to load the pre-trained model.
    3. `torch.load()` is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when loading untrusted data, as it can deserialize arbitrary Python objects.
    4. An attacker can create a malicious `primitive_decoder.pth` file containing malicious Python code embedded within the serialized data.
    5. The attacker can then trick a user into replacing the legitimate `primitive_decoder.pth` file in the `model_dump/` directory with this malicious file. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising the user's system through other means.
    6. When the user runs the LASSIE application (either for training or evaluation via `train.py` or `eval.py`), the `PartVAE.load_model` function will be called, and `torch.load()` will deserialize the malicious model file.
    7. During deserialization, the malicious Python code embedded in the model file will be executed, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running the LASSIE application.

* Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This could lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the user's system.
    - Data theft, including sensitive personal or research data.
    - Installation of malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or botnet agents.
    - Unauthorized access to other systems or networks accessible from the compromised machine.

* Vulnerability Rank:
    Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The code directly uses `torch.load()` to load the pre-trained model without any security measures.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The application should not directly load arbitrary files using `torch.load()` without verifying their integrity and authenticity.
    - **Secure Deserialization:**  Instead of `torch.load()`, a safer mechanism for loading model weights should be implemented.  Consider using `torch.jit.save` and `torch.jit.load` after converting the model to TorchScript, which reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution, or saving model weights in a safer format like `safetensors`.
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., using cryptographic hashes) for the pre-trained model file to ensure it has not been tampered with. The application should verify the hash of the downloaded model against a known good hash before loading it.
    - **Documentation and User Awareness:** Clearly document the risks associated with replacing the pre-trained model file and advise users to only use models from trusted sources. Provide instructions on how to verify the integrity of the pre-trained model if possible.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must download and install the LASSIE application.
    2. The user must download the pre-trained model `primitive_decoder.pth` and place it in the `model_dump/` directory as instructed in the `README.md`.
    3. An attacker must be able to trick the user into replacing the legitimate `primitive_decoder.pth` file with a malicious one. This could happen if the user downloads a malicious model from an untrusted source or if their system is already compromised.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Configuration:** `/code/main/config.py` defines the path to the pre-trained model:
    ```python
    File: /code/main/config.py
    Content:
    ...
    class Config:
        ...
        model_dir = osp.join(root_dir, 'model_dump')
        vae_model_path = osp.join(model_dir, 'primitive_decoder.pth')
        ...
    ```
    This shows that the model path `cfg.vae_model_path` is configurable and points to `model_dump/primitive_decoder.pth` by default.

    2. **Model Loading Function:** `/code/networks/part_vae.py` implements the `PartVAE` class with the `load_model` function:
    ```python
    File: /code/networks/part_vae.py
    Content:
    ...
    class PartVAE(torch.nn.Module):
        ...
        def load_model(self, model_path):
            self.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=cfg.device))
        ...
    ```
    The `load_model` function directly uses `torch.load(model_path, map_location=cfg.device)` to load the model state dictionary from the specified path.

    3. **Model Instantiation and Loading in `Model` class:** `/code/main/model.py` instantiates `PartVAE` and loads the model:
    ```python
    File: /code/main/model.py
    Content:
    ...
    from part_vae import *
    ...
    class Model(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, device, category, num_imgs):
            super().__init__()
            ...
            self.part_codes = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(cfg.nb, cfg.d_latent*2).float().to(device))
            part_vae = PartVAE().to(device)
            part_vae.load_model(cfg.vae_model_path) # Vulnerable model loading
            self.f_primitive = part_vae.dec
            ...
    ```
    Here, the `Model` class initializes `PartVAE` and immediately calls `part_vae.load_model(cfg.vae_model_path)`, triggering the vulnerable `torch.load()` call.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    [config.py] --> cfg.vae_model_path --> "model_dump/primitive_decoder.pth"
        |
        | (Path configuration)
        V
    [model.py] --> PartVAE.load_model(cfg.vae_model_path)
        |
        | (Calls load_model)
        V
    [part_vae.py] --> PartVAE.load_model(model_path) --> torch.load(model_path)
        |
        | (Uses vulnerable torch.load)
        V
    Arbitrary Code Execution (if model_path points to malicious file)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious model file:** Create a Python script (e.g., `malicious_model_generator.py`) to generate a malicious `primitive_decoder.pth` file. This script will:
        - Import `torch`.
        - Define a simple class with a malicious `__reduce__` method. This method is automatically called by `pickle` (which is used by `torch.load`) during deserialization and can execute arbitrary code.
        - Create an instance of this malicious class.
        - Save this instance as `primitive_decoder.pth` using `torch.save`.

        ```python
        # malicious_model_generator.py
        import torch
        import os

        class MaliciousModel:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',)) # Example: create a file /tmp/pwned

        malicious_model = MaliciousModel()
        torch.save(malicious_model, 'primitive_decoder.pth')
        print("Malicious model 'primitive_decoder.pth' generated.")
        ```

    2. **Replace the legitimate model:**
        - Run `python malicious_model_generator.py` to create `primitive_decoder.pth`.
        - Navigate to the `model_dump/` directory within the LASSIE project.
        - **Backup** the original `primitive_decoder.pth` file (if you have one).
        - Replace the original `primitive_decoder.pth` with the newly created malicious `primitive_decoder.pth` file.

    3. **Run LASSIE application:**
        - Execute either `python train.py --cls zebra` or `python eval.py --cls zebra` from the `/code/main/` directory of the LASSIE project.

    4. **Verify code execution:**
        - Check if the malicious code was executed. In the example `malicious_model_generator.py`, it attempts to create a file named `/tmp/pwned`. Check if this file exists after running `train.py` or `eval.py`. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved.
        - Observe the output and behavior of the LASSIE application for any unexpected actions or errors, which might also indicate successful code execution.

By following these steps, you can demonstrate the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the LASSIE application due to the insecure use of `torch.load()`.
