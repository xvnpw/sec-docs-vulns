### Combined Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Service Account Credentials in Cloud Function Environment

*   **Description:**
    1.  The project's README.md instructs users to create a service account with the 'BigQuery Admin' and 'Cloud Functions Invoker' roles.
    2.  Users are then guided to download the service account's JSON key file (`credentials.json`).
    3.  The README further instructs users to upload this `credentials.json` file directly into the Cloud Function's environment as a file named `credentials.json` during deployment, by adding a new file in the Cloud Function configuration in Google Cloud Console and pasting the key content.
    4.  This action embeds the highly sensitive service account private key directly within the Cloud Function's environment, making it persistently accessible in the function's file system.
    5.  Any attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment (e.g., through a separate Cloud Function vulnerability, GCP misconfiguration, compromised GCP account with sufficient permissions, or insider threat) can retrieve this `credentials.json` file from the function's file system.
    6.  With the `credentials.json` file, the attacker obtains full 'BigQuery Admin' privileges within the project, as well as 'Cloud Functions Invoker' role and access to Google Analytics data via the Admin API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Data Breach:** An attacker can gain full control over the BigQuery dataset where Google Analytics settings are stored. This includes the ability to read, modify, and delete sensitive Google Analytics configuration data, leading to potential data loss and corruption.
    *   **Confidentiality Violation:** Sensitive Google Analytics settings, which might include business strategies, marketing configurations, and user data configurations, can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can modify Google Analytics settings, potentially disrupting data collection, reporting, and analytics accuracy, leading to flawed business decisions based on compromised data.
    *   **Availability Violation:** Attackers can delete or corrupt the BigQuery dataset, leading to a loss of historical Google Analytics settings backups and potentially impacting the ability to restore previous configurations.
    *   **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation:**  A compromised service account key with 'BigQuery Admin' and 'Cloud Functions Invoker' roles and Google Analytics access might allow for lateral movement to other BigQuery datasets, Cloud Functions, or GCP resources if the service account has been granted wider permissions than strictly necessary. Attackers can also invoke the Cloud Function for malicious purposes within the Google Cloud environment.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Google Analytics Data:**  Attackers can access and potentially manipulate Google Analytics settings for all accounts and properties accessible by the compromised service account, impacting data collection and reporting integrity.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The provided documentation and scripts actively encourage insecure credential storage by instructing users to upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function environment.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Credential Management:** The project should utilize secure credential management practices.
        *   **Google Cloud Secret Manager:** Store the service account key securely in Google Cloud Secret Manager. The Cloud Function should retrieve the key from Secret Manager at runtime using the Secret Manager API instead of embedding it in the function's environment.
        *   **Workload Identity Federation:** Implement Workload Identity Federation, which allows the Cloud Function to assume the identity of the service account without requiring long-lived credentials like service account keys. This eliminates the need to store and manage service account keys altogether, providing the most secure approach.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review and restrict the service account permissions to the minimum necessary. Instead of granting the broad "BigQuery Admin" role, consider using more granular BigQuery roles like "BigQuery Data Editor" and "BigQuery Job User" if they suffice for the function's operations.
    *   **Documentation Update:** The README.md should be updated to explicitly warn against storing `credentials.json` in the Cloud Function's file system and provide clear instructions on how to use Secret Manager or Workload Identity Federation for secure credential management.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Reviews:** Implement regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The project must be deployed following the instructions in the README.md, specifically uploading the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function.
    2.  An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment or the underlying GCP project with permissions to access Cloud Function environment variables/files and file system.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`/code/README.md`:** Step 5 in the "Downloader Function" section explicitly instructs users to upload `credentials.json`:
        ```
        Click "+" to create a new file. Name this file credentials.json and add the contents of the key file you downloaded earlier after you created your service account.
        Click deploy.
        ```
        This directly leads to storing the service account private key within the Cloud Function's environment's file system.

    2.  **`/code/settings_downloader_function/main.py`:**
        ```python
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'
        ...
        def authorize_ga_apis():
          """Fetches the Google Analytics Admin API client.
          ...
          """
          source_credentials, project_id = google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)
          ga_admin_api = AnalyticsAdminServiceClient(credentials=source_credentials)
          return ga_admin_api
        ```
        The code uses `google.auth.default()`, which is designed to fetch credentials from the environment. However, the README instructions force users to place the sensitive `credentials.json` file *into* the Cloud Function's file system, causing `google.auth.default()` to prioritize and use it, effectively embedding the long-lived service account key directly within the Cloud Function.

    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    **Pre-test setup:**
    1.  Deploy the Cloud Function and BigQuery tables following all steps in the README.md, including uploading the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function environment.
    2.  Ensure the Cloud Function is successfully deployed and configured.
    3.  You will need GCP credentials with at least 'Cloud Functions Developer' role on the project where the Cloud Function is deployed to simulate an attacker with compromised access, or simulate access through other means as described below.

    **Test steps (simulating attacker actions after gaining access to GCP project):**
    1.  **Simulate Access to Cloud Function Environment:**  As direct external access to a standard Cloud Function's file system is generally not possible, for testing purposes, we simulate gaining such access. In a real-world scenario, an attacker would need to find an independent vulnerability to achieve this access. Methods to simulate this could include GCP internal access, or in a less secure test setup, intentionally misconfiguring function permissions temporarily.  Alternatively, you can modify the Cloud Function code temporarily to expose file contents (as shown in step 3).
    2.  **Access Cloud Function details (Optional):** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to 'Cloud Functions' and select the deployed Cloud Function. While direct download of environment files isn't typically available, this step is for familiarization with the function's configuration.
    3.  **Simulate file system access and retrieve `credentials.json` (or modify code to expose):**
        *   **Method A (Code Modification - more direct):** Modify the Cloud Function code temporarily to directly expose the contents of `credentials.json`. Add code to the `ga_settings_download` function in `main.py` to read and return the contents of `credentials.json` as the HTTP response. For example:
            ```python
            def ga_settings_download(event):
                ...
                with open('credentials.json', 'r') as f:
                    credentials_content = f.read()
                return credentials_content
            ```
        *   **Method B (Simulate File System Access):** If simulating environment access through other means, use commands within the simulated environment to access the Cloud Function's file system (e.g., `/tmp` or root directory) and read the `credentials.json` file.
        *   **Deploy the modified Cloud Function (if using Method A).**
        *   **Trigger the Cloud Function:** Send an HTTP request to the Cloud Function URL.
        *   **Observe the response:** If using Method A, the HTTP response body will contain the contents of the `credentials.json` file, including the private key. If using Method B, you will have directly accessed and read the file content within the simulated environment.

    4.  **Extract Service Account Credentials:** Parse the `credentials.json` content to extract the service account's `client_email` and `private_key`.
    5.  **Impersonate Service Account:** On a local machine or another GCP environment, use the downloaded `credentials.json` file (or extracted key details) to authenticate as the service account. For example, using the Google Cloud SDK:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=credentials.json
        ```
    6.  **Verify Unauthorized Access (BigQuery Admin Role):** Use the `bq ls` command to list BigQuery datasets in the project where the Cloud Function is deployed.
        ```bash
        bq ls --project=<your-gcp-project-id>
        ```
    7.  **Verify Unauthorized Access (Cloud Functions Invoker Role):** Attempt to invoke the deployed Cloud Function itself (or another Cloud Function in the project if you know its name/URL) using the impersonated service account, if applicable and testable.
    8.  **Conceptual Verification of Google Analytics Data Access:** While direct testing of Google Analytics data access from outside requires more setup, successful impersonation of the service account, which has GA access permissions, conceptually proves that the attacker could also access Google Analytics data.

    **Expected result:**
    *   By modifying the Cloud Function code or simulating file system access, the attacker can retrieve the contents of the `credentials.json` file, which contains the service account private key.
    *   With this key, the attacker can authenticate as the service account and gain 'BigQuery Admin', 'Cloud Functions Invoker' access, and potentially Google Analytics data access, proving the vulnerability.

    **Post-test cleanup:**
    1.  Revert the changes made to `main.py` in the security test case if you used Method A.
    2.  Redeploy the original Cloud Function code.
    3.  Ideally, delete the `credentials.json` file from the Cloud Function environment after testing (though the vulnerability is the instruction to put it there in the first place).

This test case demonstrates that following the project's README instructions leads to insecure storage of service account credentials, creating a critical vulnerability that allows for unauthorized access to GCP resources and potentially Google Analytics data.
