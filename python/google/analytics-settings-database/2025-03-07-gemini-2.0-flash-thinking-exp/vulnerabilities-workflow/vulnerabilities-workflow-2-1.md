### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Service Account Credentials in Cloud Function Environment Variable

*   **Description:**
    1.  The project's README.md instructs users to create a service account with the 'BigQuery Admin' and 'Cloud Functions Invoker' roles.
    2.  Users are then guided to download the service account's JSON key file (`credentials.json`).
    3.  The README further instructs users to upload this `credentials.json` file directly into the Cloud Function's environment as a file named `credentials.json`.
    4.  This action embeds the highly sensitive service account private key directly within the Cloud Function's environment.
    5.  Any attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment (e.g., through a separate Cloud Function vulnerability, GCP misconfiguration, or compromised GCP account with sufficient permissions) can retrieve this `credentials.json` file.
    6.  With the `credentials.json` file, the attacker obtains full 'BigQuery Admin' privileges within the project.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Data Breach:** An attacker can gain full control over the BigQuery dataset where Google Analytics settings are stored. This includes the ability to read, modify, and delete sensitive Google Analytics configuration data.
    *   **Confidentiality Violation:** Sensitive Google Analytics settings, which might include business strategies, marketing configurations, and user data configurations, can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can modify Google Analytics settings, potentially disrupting data collection, reporting, and analytics accuracy, leading to flawed business decisions based on compromised data.
    *   **Availability Violation:** Attackers can delete or corrupt the BigQuery dataset, leading to a loss of historical Google Analytics settings backups and potentially impacting the ability to restore previous configurations.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** In a broader GCP environment, a compromised service account key with 'BigQuery Admin' role might allow for lateral movement to other BigQuery datasets or GCP resources if the service account has been granted wider permissions than strictly necessary (though in this setup, the provided instructions limit the scope to BigQuery Admin and Cloud Functions Invoker).

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The provided documentation and scripts actively encourage insecure credential storage.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Credential Management:** The project should utilize secure credential management practices like Google Cloud Secret Manager to store the service account key. The Cloud Function should retrieve the key from Secret Manager at runtime instead of embedding it in the function's environment.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** While the instructions suggest granting 'BigQuery Admin', it's crucial to review if 'BigQuery Admin' is strictly necessary.  Ideally, the service account should be granted only the minimum required BigQuery permissions, such as 'BigQuery Data Editor' and 'BigQuery Job User', if these are sufficient for the Cloud Function's operation.  'BigQuery Admin' is a very powerful role and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (for future enhancements):** Although not directly related to this vulnerability but as a general security practice, if the project is extended to accept external input, proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Reviews:** Implement regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The project must be deployed following the instructions in the README.md, specifically uploading the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function.
    2.  An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment or the underlying GCP project with permissions to access Cloud Function environment variables/files.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`/code/README.md`:** Step 5 in the "Downloader Function" section explicitly instructs users to:
        ```
        Click "+" to create a new file. Name this file credentials.json and add the contents of the key file you downloaded earlier after you created your service account.
        Click deploy.
        ```
        This directly leads to storing the service account private key within the Cloud Function's environment.

    2.  **`/code/settings_downloader_function/main.py`:**
        ```python
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'
        ...
        def authorize_ga_apis():
          """Fetches the Google Analytics Admin API client.
          ...
          """
          source_credentials, project_id = google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)
          ga_admin_api = AnalyticsAdminServiceClient(credentials=source_credentials)
          return ga_admin_api
        ```
        While the code itself uses `google.auth.default()`, which is intended to securely fetch credentials from the environment, the README instructions force users to place the sensitive `credentials.json` file *into* the environment, negating the security benefits of `google.auth.default()`.  If `credentials.json` is present in the Cloud Function's environment, `google.auth.default()` will prioritize using it.

    **Visualization:**

    ```

                                                                         ^
    [Attacker Compromises Cloud Function/GCP] ----------------------------|
                                                                         |
    [Attacker Accesses Cloud Function Environment] --> Retrieves credentials.json --> [Attacker Obtains BigQuery Admin Key]
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    **Pre-test setup:**
    1.  Deploy the Cloud Function and BigQuery tables following all steps in the README.md, including uploading the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function environment.
    2.  Ensure the Cloud Function is successfully deployed and configured.
    3.  You will need GCP credentials with at least 'Cloud Functions Developer' role on the project where the Cloud Function is deployed to simulate an attacker with compromised access.

    **Test steps (simulating attacker actions after gaining access to GCP project):**
    1.  **Access Cloud Function details:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to 'Cloud Functions' and select the deployed Cloud Function.
    2.  **Attempt to download function source code:**  While direct download of environment files isn't typically available through the console, an attacker with sufficient GCP permissions (e.g., 'Cloud Functions Developer') could potentially use the `gcloud functions describe` command or Cloud Functions API to retrieve function details, which, depending on internal GCP implementation and permissions, *might* reveal file contents if directly embedded. (Note: Direct file download from Cloud Function environment is usually restricted, but the configuration itself leads to insecure storage).
    3.  **Simulate environment access (Alternative more direct approach if direct file download is restricted):**  A more reliable approach to demonstrate the vulnerability is to modify the Cloud Function code temporarily to directly expose the contents of `credentials.json`.
        *   **Modify `main.py` temporarily:** Add code to the `ga_settings_download` function to read and return the contents of `credentials.json` as the HTTP response. For example:
            ```python
            def ga_settings_download(event):
                ...
                with open('credentials.json', 'r') as f:
                    credentials_content = f.read()
                return credentials_content
            ```
        *   **Deploy the modified Cloud Function.**
        *   **Trigger the Cloud Function:** Send an HTTP request to the Cloud Function URL.
        *   **Observe the response:** The HTTP response body will contain the contents of the `credentials.json` file, including the private key.

    **Expected result:**
    *   By modifying the Cloud Function code (or potentially through advanced GCP API access depending on permissions), the attacker can retrieve the contents of the `credentials.json` file, which contains the service account private key.
    *   With this key, the attacker can authenticate as the service account and gain 'BigQuery Admin' access, proving the vulnerability.

    **Post-test cleanup:**
    1.  Revert the changes made to `main.py` in the security test case.
    2.  Redeploy the original Cloud Function code.
    3.  Ideally, delete the `credentials.json` file from the Cloud Function environment after testing (though the vulnerability is the instruction to put it there in the first place).

This test case demonstrates that following the project's README instructions leads to insecure storage of service account credentials, creating a critical vulnerability.
