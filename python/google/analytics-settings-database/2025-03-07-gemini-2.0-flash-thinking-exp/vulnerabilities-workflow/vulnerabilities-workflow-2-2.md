### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Service Account Credentials in Cloud Function
- Description:
    1. The project's deployment instructions in the README.md guide users to create a service account key file (`credentials.json`).
    2. Users are then instructed to upload this `credentials.json` file directly into the Cloud Function's file system during deployment as an additional file.
    3. The Cloud Function code (`settings_downloader_function/main.py`) is configured to use `google.auth.default()` for authentication, which, in the Cloud Function environment, will detect and use the `credentials.json` file if it exists in the function's file system.
    4. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the deployed Cloud Function's environment (e.g., by exploiting a GCP misconfiguration or other vulnerabilities) can access the function's file system.
    5. The attacker can then retrieve the `credentials.json` file, which contains the private key for the service account.
    6. With the `credentials.json` file, the attacker can impersonate the service account and gain the permissions associated with it, including modifying Google Analytics settings of connected accounts.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full control over the Google Analytics settings of all accounts accessible by the compromised service account. This includes the ability to read, modify, and delete Google Analytics configurations, leading to potential data manipulation, reporting inaccuracies, and disruption of analytics tracking for the affected Google Analytics accounts.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project's documentation explicitly instructs users to embed the service account key file within the Cloud Function.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Use Google Cloud Secret Manager**: Instead of embedding the service account key file directly in the Cloud Function, the project should be reconfigured to store the service account key securely in Google Cloud Secret Manager. The Cloud Function should then retrieve the key from Secret Manager at runtime using the Cloud Secret Manager API. This would prevent the key from being directly accessible within the Cloud Function's environment.
    - **Implement Workload Identity Federation**: The project could leverage Workload Identity Federation, which allows the Cloud Function to assume the identity of the service account without requiring long-lived credentials like service account keys. This would eliminate the need to store and manage service account keys altogether.
- Preconditions:
    - The project must be deployed according to the instructions in the README.md, which includes creating a service account key and uploading the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function.
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the deployed Cloud Function's environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/settings_downloader_function/main.py`:
        ```python
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'
        ...
        def authorize_ga_apis():
          """Fetches the Google Analytics Admin API client.
          ...
          source_credentials, project_id = google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)
        ```
        - The `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'` line defines the expected filename for the service account credentials.
        - The `authorize_ga_apis` function uses `google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)`. When running in a Google Cloud Function environment and with a `credentials.json` file present in the function's root directory (due to the upload in deployment), `google.auth.default()` will automatically load credentials from this file. This embeds the long-lived service account key directly within the Cloud Function.
    - `/code/README.md`:
        - Step 5 in the "Downloader Function" implementation guide explicitly instructs users to:
            - "Click "+" to create a new file. Name this file credentials.json and add the contents of the key file you downloaded earlier after you created your service account."
            - "Click deploy."
        - These instructions directly lead to embedding the service account key file within the deployed Cloud Function.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the Google Analytics Settings Database Cloud Function as described in the `/code/README.md`, specifically following step 5 to upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function during deployment.
    2. After successful deployment, simulate gaining access to the Cloud Function's execution environment. *Note: In a real-world scenario, an attacker would need to find an independent vulnerability to achieve this access. For testing purposes in a controlled environment, methods to simulate this could include GCP internal access, or in a less secure test setup, intentionally misconfiguring function permissions temporarily.*
    3. Once you have simulated access to the Cloud Function's environment, navigate to the function's file system.
    4. Locate and download the `credentials.json` file. This file should be present in the root directory of the Cloud Function's deployment.
    5. On a local machine or another GCP environment, use the downloaded `credentials.json` file to authenticate as the service account. For example, using the Google Cloud SDK:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=credentials.json
        ```
    6. After successful authentication, attempt to perform an action that requires the permissions granted to the service account. For instance, use the `ga-admins` library or `gcloud` command to list Google Analytics accounts that the service account has access to:
        ```bash
        gcloud analytics admin accounts list
        ```
    7. If the command in step 6 successfully lists Google Analytics accounts, it confirms that the service account credentials extracted from the Cloud Function are valid and can be used to access and potentially modify Google Analytics settings. This demonstrates the vulnerability of embedding service account keys within the Cloud Function.
