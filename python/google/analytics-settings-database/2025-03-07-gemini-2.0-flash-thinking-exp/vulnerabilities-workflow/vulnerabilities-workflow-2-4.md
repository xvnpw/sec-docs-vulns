### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Service Account Credentials

- **Description:**
    1. The project's deployment instructions in the README.md guide users to create a service account key in JSON format (`credentials.json`).
    2. Users are then instructed to upload this `credentials.json` file directly into the Cloud Function's file system by adding it as a new file during function deployment in the Google Cloud Console.
    3. This practice stores sensitive service account credentials directly within the Cloud Function's environment.
    4. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment (e.g., through a GCP misconfiguration, another vulnerability in GCP, or insider threat), they can potentially retrieve the `credentials.json` file.
    5. With the `credentials.json` file, the attacker can impersonate the service account.
    6. This impersonation allows the attacker to leverage all permissions granted to the service account, which in this project includes BigQuery Admin and Cloud Functions Invoker roles, as well as access to Google Analytics data via the Admin API.
    7. Consequently, the attacker can exfiltrate sensitive Google Analytics settings stored in BigQuery, manipulate these settings, or potentially pivot to other resources within the Google Cloud project.

- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    - Gain full control over the `analytics_settings_database` BigQuery dataset, including reading, modifying, and deleting data. This could lead to data loss, data corruption, or unauthorized access to historical Google Analytics settings.
    - Invoke the Cloud Function, potentially disrupting its intended functionality or using it for malicious purposes within the Google Cloud environment.
    - Access and potentially manipulate Google Analytics settings for all accounts and properties accessible by the compromised service account. This could result in unauthorized changes to analytics configurations, impacting data collection and reporting integrity.
    - Potentially escalate privileges or move laterally within the Google Cloud project, depending on the specific roles and permissions assigned to the compromised service account beyond those explicitly required by this project.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project, as described in the provided files, does not implement any specific mitigations for the insecure storage of `credentials.json`. The README instructions actively encourage this insecure practice.
    - While the principle of least privilege is implicitly encouraged by granting specific roles (BigQuery Admin and Cloud Functions Invoker) to the service account, the insecure storage of the key negates much of this benefit, as full control over these roles is achievable with the leaked key.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Use Google Cloud Secret Manager:** Instead of storing `credentials.json` directly in the Cloud Function's file system, the project should leverage Google Cloud Secret Manager. The `credentials.json` file should be stored securely in Secret Manager. The Cloud Function should then be configured to retrieve the service account key from Secret Manager at runtime using the Secret Manager API. This prevents the key from being directly exposed within the function's environment.
    - **Implement Workload Identity Federation:** The most secure approach would be to eliminate the need for `credentials.json` altogether by using Workload Identity Federation. This feature allows the Cloud Function to assume the identity of the service account automatically without needing to store or manage long-lived credentials. By enabling Workload Identity on the Cloud Function and granting it the necessary IAM roles, the function can authenticate with Google Cloud services securely.
    - **Documentation Update:** The README.md should be updated to explicitly warn against storing `credentials.json` in the Cloud Function's file system and provide clear instructions on how to use Secret Manager or Workload Identity Federation for secure credential management.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user has followed the deployment instructions in the README.md and created a service account key file (`credentials.json`).
    - The user has uploaded the `credentials.json` file into the Cloud Function's file system as instructed.
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's execution environment or underlying storage.  *(Note: Direct external access to Cloud Function's filesystem is generally restricted by GCP security measures.  For the purpose of demonstrating the vulnerability, we assume a scenario where an attacker has bypassed these controls, possibly through other GCP vulnerabilities, insider access, or misconfigurations unrelated to this project's code.)*

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/settings_downloader_function/main.py`:
        - `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'`: This line defines the expected filename for the service account credentials, indicating that the application is designed to use a `credentials.json` file.
        - The code uses `google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)` to obtain credentials for authenticating with Google Cloud APIs. When `google.auth.default()` is used without explicitly providing credentials, it searches for credentials in the environment, including the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and well-known file locations, which would include files uploaded to the Cloud Function's filesystem.
    - `/code/README.md`:
        - Step 5 in the "Downloader Function" implementation section explicitly instructs users to:
            - "Click '+' to create a new file. Name this file `credentials.json` and add the contents of the key file you downloaded earlier after you created your service account."
            - "Click deploy."
        - This step clearly directs users to store the sensitive `credentials.json` file directly within the deployed Cloud Function's environment, making it accessible if the function's environment is compromised.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy the Cloud Function with Insecure Credentials:** Follow the steps in the README.md to deploy the `analytics-settings-downloader` Cloud Function. Critically, ensure you create a new file named `credentials.json` within the Cloud Function's configuration and paste the contents of your downloaded service account key file into it, as instructed in the README.md. Deploy the function.
    2. **Simulate Unauthorized Access to Cloud Function Environment:** *(Note: Directly accessing the Cloud Function's filesystem from outside is generally restricted. For this test, we simulate gaining access. In a real-world scenario, this might involve exploiting other vulnerabilities in GCP or gaining internal access. For testing purposes, assume you have a method to execute commands within the Cloud Function's container or access its storage bucket. One potential (though complex and likely against GCP terms of service for production systems) method for testing within a controlled environment could involve exploiting a hypothetical vulnerability or misconfiguration that allows for function introspection or container access. For a simplified demonstration, we can assume we have gained access to the Cloud Function's storage.)*
    3. **Retrieve `credentials.json`:** Access the Cloud Function's file system (or simulated access point). Navigate to the location where files added during deployment are stored. Locate and download the `credentials.json` file.
    4. **Impersonate Service Account:** On a separate machine or GCP environment (outside the project where the Cloud Function is deployed), set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the downloaded `credentials.json` file.
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/downloaded/credentials.json"
        ```
    5. **Verify Impersonation - BigQuery Access:** Use the `gcloud bq ls` command to list BigQuery datasets in the project where the Cloud Function is deployed.
        ```bash
        gcloud bq ls --project=<your-gcp-project-id>
        ```
        If the command successfully lists the BigQuery datasets, it confirms that you have successfully impersonated the service account and have BigQuery access.
    6. **Verify Impersonation - Google Analytics Admin API Access:** Use a Python script with the Google Analytics Admin API client library, authenticated using `google.auth.default()`, to attempt to access Google Analytics settings for an account the service account should have access to. If you can successfully retrieve account or property information, it further confirms the successful impersonation and access to Google Analytics data.
    7. **Impact Confirmation:** The successful execution of steps 5 and 6 demonstrates that an attacker who retrieves the `credentials.json` file gains the ability to act as the service account, achieving unauthorized access to BigQuery and Google Analytics data, thus validating the "Insecure Storage of Service Account Credentials" vulnerability and its critical impact.
