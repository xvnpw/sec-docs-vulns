### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Credentials Exposure via Cloud Function File System
- Description:
    1. The project's deployment instructions in the README.md guide users to create a service account and download its JSON key file (`credentials.json`).
    2. Users are then instructed to upload this `credentials.json` file directly into the Google Cloud Function's file system as part of the deployment process. This is done by navigating to the Cloud Function's edit page in the Google Cloud Console, adding a new file, naming it `credentials.json`, pasting the contents of the downloaded key file, and deploying the function.
    3. By storing the `credentials.json` file within the Cloud Function's file system, the service account's private key material becomes persistently accessible within the function's execution environment.
    4. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's execution environment (e.g., through a separate vulnerability in the Cloud Function runtime, dependencies, or due to insider threat/misconfiguration) can potentially read the `credentials.json` file.
    5. Once the `credentials.json` file is compromised, the attacker can extract the service account's private key and email address.
    6. With these stolen credentials, the attacker can impersonate the service account and perform actions with the permissions granted to that service account.
- Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Access to Google Cloud Resources:** The compromised service account in this project is granted the "BigQuery Admin" and "Cloud Functions Invoker" roles. This allows an attacker to:
        - **BigQuery Admin:** Gain full control over BigQuery datasets and tables within the Google Cloud Project, including the `analytics_settings_database` dataset. This includes the ability to read, modify, delete data, and manage BigQuery resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or data loss.
        - **Cloud Functions Invoker:** Invoke other Cloud Functions within the project, potentially disrupting services or further escalating attacks if other functions have vulnerabilities or sensitive functionalities.
    - **Unauthorized Access to Google Analytics Data:** The service account is also granted access to Google Analytics 4 accounts. By impersonating the service account, an attacker could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive Google Analytics settings data beyond the intended scope of the backup.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the overall Google Cloud project configuration and the specific permissions of the compromised service account, the attacker might be able to further escalate privileges and gain broader access to other Google Cloud resources beyond BigQuery and Cloud Functions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project's README.md explicitly instructs users to upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function. There are no security measures in place to prevent credentials exposure through this method.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Credential Management using Workload Identity:** The most secure approach is to leverage Google Cloud's Workload Identity feature. This eliminates the need to manually manage and upload `credentials.json` files.
        - By enabling Workload Identity for the Cloud Function, the function can automatically authenticate as a service account without needing a key file.
        - Google Cloud manages the service account credentials securely in the background.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The service account should be granted only the minimum necessary permissions required for the function to perform its intended tasks (exporting Google Analytics settings to BigQuery).
        - Instead of granting the broad "BigQuery Admin" role, consider using more granular BigQuery roles like "BigQuery Data Editor" and "BigQuery Job User" if they suffice for the function's operations. This limits the potential impact if the service account is compromised.
    - **Secret Manager (Less Recommended for this specific use case but still an improvement over file system storage):** Alternatively, although less ideal than Workload Identity for Cloud Functions, the service account key could be stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager.
        - The Cloud Function code would then need to be modified to fetch the credentials from Secret Manager at runtime using the Secret Manager API.
        - This is still better than storing the file in the function's file system but adds complexity and is not as seamless as Workload Identity.
- Preconditions:
    1. The user must follow the deployment instructions in the project's README.md and upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function as instructed.
    2. An attacker must be able to gain unauthorized access to the deployed Google Cloud Function's execution environment. This could occur through various means, such as:
        - Exploiting a vulnerability in the Cloud Function's runtime environment or its dependencies.
        - Insider threat with access to the Google Cloud project.
        - Misconfiguration of Cloud Function security settings.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`settings_downloader_function/main.py`**: This Python code is the main logic of the Cloud Function.
    2. **`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'credentials.json'`**:  This line defines a variable suggesting the intended use of a `credentials.json` file, although it's not directly used in the authentication logic in the provided code.
    3. **`authorize_ga_apis()` function**:
        ```python
        def authorize_ga_apis():
          """Fetches the Google Analytics Admin API client.

          Returns:
            The admin API client.
          """
          source_credentials, project_id = google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)
          ga_admin_api = AnalyticsAdminServiceClient(credentials=source_credentials)
          return ga_admin_api
        ```
        - This function uses `google.auth.default(scopes=GA_SCOPES)` to obtain Google Cloud credentials.
        - When running within a Google Cloud Function, `google.auth.default()` automatically attempts to obtain credentials from the environment. This includes checking for:
            - Workload Identity (if enabled).
            - Service account attached to the Cloud Function.
            - Credentials specified by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
        - **Crucially, `google.auth.default()` will also look for and use the `credentials.json` file if it is present in the function's file system.** This is because uploading `credentials.json` as instructed in the README makes it accessible within the Cloud Function's environment, and `google.auth.default()` is designed to detect and use such credentials.
    4. **`README.md` Deployment Instructions**: The README explicitly directs users to:
        - Create a service account and download the `credentials.json` key file.
        - In the Google Cloud Console, when editing the deployed Cloud Function, add a new file named `credentials.json` and paste the contents of the downloaded key file into it.
        - Deploy the Cloud Function with this embedded `credentials.json` file.
    5. **Vulnerability Point**: By following these instructions, the `credentials.json` file is directly embedded into the Cloud Function's deployment package and becomes persistently stored in the function's file system. This makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access if an attacker can somehow access the function's environment.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy the Google Cloud Function as described in the README.md, ensuring you upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Function's file system during deployment.
        - Ensure the service account associated with the Cloud Function (via `credentials.json`) has the "BigQuery Admin" role on the target Google Cloud project and access to Google Analytics accounts.
    2. **Gain Access to Cloud Function Execution Environment (Simulated):** In a real-world scenario, an attacker would need to find a way to compromise the Cloud Function's environment. For the purpose of this test case, we will *simulate* gaining such access.  **Note:** Direct external access to a standard Cloud Function's file system is generally not possible. This test case simulates a scenario where an attacker has achieved internal access or exploited another vulnerability to gain code execution within the Cloud Function's environment.
    3. **Access `credentials.json`:**
        - Once "inside" the Cloud Function's environment (simulated), use standard file system commands (e.g., in a debugging session or through a hypothetical remote code execution vulnerability) to read the contents of the `/tmp/credentials.json` file (or the root directory, depending on where the file was actually placed during upload and how the function's environment is structured).
        - For example, in a Python debugging context within the function, you could execute:
          ```python
          with open('/tmp/credentials.json', 'r') as f: # or potentially just 'credentials.json'
              credentials_content = f.read()
          print(credentials_content)
          ```
    4. **Extract Service Account Credentials:**
        - Parse the `credentials_content` (which is a JSON string) to extract the service account's `client_email` and `private_key`.
    5. **Impersonate Service Account:**
        - Using a separate machine or environment *outside* the Cloud Function, use a tool like `gcloud` CLI or a Google Cloud client library with the extracted `client_email` and `private_key` to authenticate as the compromised service account.
        - For example, using `gcloud`:
          ```bash
          gcloud auth activate-service-account <client_email> --key-file=<(echo '<credentials_content>')
          gcloud config set project <your-gcp-project-id> # Set to the project where the service account is.
          ```
    6. **Verify Unauthorized Access (BigQuery Admin Role):**
        - Attempt to perform administrative actions in BigQuery using the impersonated service account. For example:
          ```bash
          bq ls # List datasets in the project.
          bq mk -d <your-gcp-project-id>:attacker_dataset_test # Attempt to create a new dataset.
          ```
        - If these commands succeed, it confirms that the attacker has successfully impersonated the service account and gained BigQuery Admin privileges, demonstrating the impact of the credentials exposure vulnerability.
    7. **Verify Unauthorized Access (Cloud Functions Invoker Role):**
        - Attempt to invoke the deployed Cloud Function itself (or any other Cloud Function in the project if you know its name/URL) using the impersonated service account.
        - If invocation is successful, it demonstrates the attacker can also leverage the Cloud Functions Invoker role.
    8. **Verification of Google Analytics Data Access (Conceptual):** While directly testing Google Analytics data access from outside requires more setup (GA account access, API calls), the successful impersonation of the service account, which has GA access permissions, conceptually proves that the attacker *could* also access Google Analytics data if they chose to use the compromised credentials for that purpose.

This test case demonstrates that by following the project's deployment instructions, the service account credentials become exposed within the Cloud Function's environment, allowing an attacker who gains access to that environment to steal the credentials and impersonate the service account, gaining unauthorized control over Google Cloud resources and potentially Google Analytics data.
