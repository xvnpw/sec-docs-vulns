### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Input Validation in Definition Files
- Description:
  1. An attacker gains the ability to modify object definition files (`.net`, `.svc`).
  2. The attacker injects malicious data into these files, such as invalid IP addresses, malformed service definitions, or unexpected characters in token names.
  3. Capirca processes these modified definition files. Due to insufficient input validation, the malicious data is parsed and incorporated into the policy object.
  4. When ACL configurations are generated, the malicious data is translated into firewall rules.
  5. These injected rules could bypass intended security controls, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.
- Impact: An attacker could inject arbitrary firewall rules by manipulating definition files, leading to unauthorized network access and bypassing security policies.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Procedural mitigation: The README.md states "The Capirca threat model assumes some control and verification of policy definitions". It is recommended to test generated ACLs before production.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement input validation for token names and definitions in `.net` and `.svc` files.
    - Validate IP address formats and ranges in `.net` files.
    - Validate port numbers and protocol names in `.svc` files.
    - Sanitize token names to prevent injection of control characters or potentially harmful names.
    - Implement error handling for invalid input formats in definition files to prevent parsing errors or misinterpretations.
- Preconditions:
  - Attacker needs write access to the object definition files (`.net`, `.svc`) used by Capirca.
- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/capirca/lib/naming.py`
  2. Functions: `ParseNetworkList(self, data)` and `ParseServiceList(self, data)` parse `.net` and `.svc` files.
  3. **Network parsing (`ParseNetworkList`)**:
     - Iterates through lines, splits by `=`, token is before `=`, definitions after `=`.
     - Uses `nacaddr.IP` for basic IP format validation, but no token name validation or comprehensive range validation.
  4. **Service parsing (`ParseServiceList`)**:
     - Similar structure to `ParseNetworkList`.
     - Splits lines, token before `=`, service definitions after `=`.
     - Minimal validation on `port_proto` format, no token name validation.
  5. **Vulnerability**: Lack of input validation in `ParseNetworkList` and `ParseServiceList` allows injection of malicious data via definition files, as token names and definitions are not strictly validated beyond basic format checks.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Setup:
     - Set up Capirca environment with sample policy and definition files.
     - Modify `def/NETWORK.net` to include:
       ```
       MALICIOUS_NET = 1.2.3.4/32 # Malicious Network
       INJECTED_CMD = `$(malicious_command)` # Attempt command injection (benign in this context)
       INVALID_IP = 999.999.999.999/32 # Invalid IP address
       ```
     - Create `policies/test_injection.pol`:
       ```pol
       header {
         target:: cisco test-injection
       }

       term malicious-term {
         source-address:: MALICIOUS_NET
         destination-address:: ANY
         action:: accept
         comment:: "Injected malicious rule"
       }

       term invalid-ip-term {
         source-address:: INVALID_IP
         destination-address:: ANY
         action:: deny
         comment:: "Term with invalid IP"
       }
       ```
  2. Run Capirca:
     ```bash
     ./aclgen --policy_file policies/test_injection.pol --output_directory ./filters_test_injection --definitions_directory ./def
     ```
  3. Analyze Output (`filters_test_injection/test_injection.acl`):
     - Vulnerable Expected Result: ACL generated without errors, including rule for `MALICIOUS_NET` (1.2.3.4/32). `INVALID_IP` term ideally skipped or warned about, but no crashes. `INJECTED_CMD` treated as comment.
     - Mitigated Expected Result: Capirca reports error/warning for `INVALID_IP`, skips `invalid-ip-term`. `INJECTED_CMD` ignored. ACL generated (potentially partial/warning-annotated), preventing rules based on invalid definitions.
  4. Conclusion: If ACL generated with `malicious-term` and no errors for `INVALID_IP`, it validates insufficient input validation vulnerability, enabling policy injection via definition files.
