### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via Policy File Inclusion

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the system managing policy definition files (`.pol` files). This could be achieved through various means such as compromising a user account with write access to the policy file repository, exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that manage these files (e.g., version control systems, shared file systems), or through social engineering.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious policy file (`.pol`) containing an `#include` directive designed to access files outside the intended 'includes/' subdirectory. For example, the attacker could insert `#include '../malicious_include.inc'` or `#include '../../../../sensitive_file.inc'`.
    3. The Capirca tool is executed to generate ACL configurations, processing the attacker's malicious policy file.
    4. If the tool fails to properly sanitize or validate the include path, it may follow the attacker-provided path and include files from unintended locations.
    5. This could lead to the inclusion of:
        - Malicious policy terms from attacker-controlled files, allowing injection of arbitrary ACL rules.
        - Sensitive data from files outside the policy directory, if the included file content is somehow exposed or processed by Capirca in a way that reveals its content (less likely but possible depending on how includes are processed).
    6. When the generated ACL configurations are deployed to network devices, the injected malicious rules could weaken network security, grant unauthorized access, or disrupt network operations, depending on the content of the malicious include file.

- Impact:
    - **High:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary ACL rules into network configurations generated by Capirca. This can lead to significant security breaches, including unauthorized network access, data exfiltration, and disruption of services. The impact depends on the attacker's ability to craft effective malicious rules and the scope of the deployed ACLs.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation in `README.md` and `doc/generators_patterns.md` mentions that "Includes are only read from the subdirectories of your base_directory, all other directories will error out." This suggests an attempt to restrict include paths to prevent traversal. However, the provided files do not contain the source code that enforces this restriction, so the effectiveness of this mitigation cannot be verified from these files alone.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The project is missing explicit input validation and sanitization of the include path in the `#include` directive processing logic. It should strictly validate that the included file path is within the allowed 'includes/' subdirectory of the base policy directory and reject any paths attempting to traverse outside of it or using absolute paths.
    - **Path Canonicalization:** Before attempting to include a file, the include path should be canonicalized to resolve symbolic links and remove path components like `..` and `.`. This would prevent attackers from bypassing path validation using directory traversal sequences.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The process running Capirca should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to access policy and definition files. This would limit the impact if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited, as the attacker would only be able to access files that the Capirca process itself has access to.

- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker needs write access to the policy definition files (`.pol`, `.net`, `.svc`) or the system managing them.
    2. Capirca tool must be configured to process the attacker-modified policy file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/README.md**
        - The README.md file describes the `#include` directive and mentions the restriction to subdirectories of the `base_directory`.
        ```markdown
        NOTE: Includes are only read from the subdirectories of your base_directory,
        all other directories will error out.
        ```
        - This is the only indication of a mitigation related to include paths in the provided documentation.

    - **File: /code/doc/generators_patterns.md**
        - This file does not provide any information related to include directive security.

    - **Other Files:**
        - The rest of the provided files (generator documentation, setup files, test files, etc.) do not contain information relevant to the `#include` directive's implementation or security.
        - The provided files lack the core parsing logic (likely in `lib/policy.py` or related files, which are not fully provided), so it's impossible to analyze how the `#include` directive is actually processed and if the subdirectory restriction is implemented and correctly enforced in the code.

    - **Visualization:**
        ```

    - **Code Walkthrough (Conceptual - based on documentation, actual code not available):**
        1. The `policy.ParsePolicy` function (or related parsing functions) in `policy.py` likely handles the parsing of `.pol` files.
        2. When the parser encounters an `#include` directive, it extracts the file path.
        3. **Vulnerability Point:** The parser needs to validate the extracted file path. It should:
            - Check if the path is relative or absolute. Absolute paths should be rejected.
            - If relative, it should resolve the path relative to the base policy directory, and then verify if the resolved path is still within a designated 'includes/' subdirectory (or similar allowed location) under the base directory.
            - It should prevent directory traversal sequences like `..` in the path.
        4. If the path is validated, the parser reads the content of the included file and injects it into the policy at the location of the `#include` directive.
        5. If validation is missing or insufficient, a path traversal vulnerability exists.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume you have a Capirca project setup with a base policy directory (e.g., `./policies`) and a definitions directory (e.g., `./def`).
        - Create an 'includes' subdirectory within the policy directory (e.g., `./policies/includes/`).
        - Place a legitimate include file (e.g., `legitimate.inc`) inside the 'includes' directory.
        - Create a sensitive file outside the policy directory but accessible by the user running Capirca (e.g., `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`) containing some identifiable content like "THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA".
        - Create a malicious include file (e.g., `malicious_include.inc`) within the 'includes' directory that, for testing purposes, attempts to include the sensitive file:
          ```
          # malicious_include.inc
          #include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'
          ```
        - Alternatively, for a simpler test without creating a malicious include file, directly embed the path traversal in the main policy file.

    2. **Craft Malicious Policy File:**
        - Create a new policy file (e.g., `policies/pol/malicious_policy.pol`) with the following content:
          ```
          header {
            target:: juniper test-filter inet
          }

          term test-include {
            action:: accept
            verbatim:: juniper "This is before included content:"
            verbatim:: juniper "#include '../malicious_include.inc'"  # or #include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'
            verbatim:: juniper "This is after included content:"
          }
          ```
           - Or directly:
          ```
          header {
            target:: juniper test-filter inet
          }

          term test-include {
            action:: accept
            verbatim:: juniper "This is before included content:"
            verbatim:: juniper "#include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'"
            verbatim:: juniper "This is after included content:"
          }
          ```

    3. **Run Capirca:**
        - Execute the Capirca tool to generate ACLs, targeting the malicious policy file:
          ```bash
          ./aclgen --policy_file policies/pol/malicious_policy.pol --output_directory ./filters
          ```

    4. **Analyze Output:**
        - Examine the generated output file (e.g., `filters/test_filter.jcl` for Juniper).
        - **Check for Sensitive Data Inclusion:** If the path traversal is successful and includes `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`, the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` ("THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA") might be present in the generated ACL configuration, likely within the `verbatim` sections of the `test-include` term or potentially causing parser errors if the included content is not valid policy syntax.
        - **Check for Error Messages:** If the tool correctly prevents path traversal, it should output an error message indicating an invalid include path or restricted directory access, and the sensitive data should not be included in the output.

    5. **Expected Results (Vulnerable Case):**
        - The generated ACL configuration will contain the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` (or parser errors due to invalid content if directly including a non-policy file).
        - This confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the tool included a file from outside the intended policy directory due to the `#include` directive.

    6. **Expected Results (Mitigated Case):**
        - The Capirca tool will output an error message related to invalid include path or directory restriction.
        - The generated ACL configuration will *not* contain the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`.
        - This indicates that the path traversal vulnerability is mitigated, and the tool correctly restricts include paths.

    7. **Rank Adjustment (If Mitigated):** If the test shows that the vulnerability is mitigated (step 6), the vulnerability rank should be adjusted to Low or Medium (depending on the strength of the mitigation and potential for bypass), or the vulnerability should be removed from the list if the mitigation is deemed fully effective. Deeper code analysis would be needed to confirm the robustness of the mitigation.
