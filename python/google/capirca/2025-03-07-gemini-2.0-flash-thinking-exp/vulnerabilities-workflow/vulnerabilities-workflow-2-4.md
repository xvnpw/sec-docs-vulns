- **Vulnerability Name:** Improper Handling of Exclude Keywords Leading to Permissive Rules
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious policy file that uses `source-exclude` or `destination-exclude` in combination with other complex term conditions (e.g., multiple source/destination addresses, ports, protocols).
    2. Due to a parsing or logical flaw in Capirca, the exclude conditions are not correctly applied when combined with other conditions.
    3. Capirca generates firewall configurations where the exclusion is ineffective or partially effective, leading to rules that are more permissive than intended by the policy author.
    4. A user, unaware of the vulnerability, processes this malicious policy file using Capirca.
    5. The generated firewall configuration is deployed, unintentionally allowing traffic that should have been blocked by the exclude condition.
- **Impact:**
    - Network access control bypass. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to network resources due to overly permissive firewall rules.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None apparent from the provided documentation files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust parsing and validation of policy files, especially when using exclude keywords in combination with complex conditions.
    - Security testing focused on edge cases and complex policy combinations to ensure correct rule generation.
    - Input sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks (though less relevant to this specific vulnerability).
    - Code review focusing on the logic handling exclude keywords and complex term conditions.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can trick a user into using a maliciously crafted policy file.
    - User has Capirca installed and uses it to generate firewall configurations.
    - User deploys the generated firewall configurations.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    (Hypothetical - Source code access needed for accurate analysis)
    1. Assume the parsing logic for `term` blocks in `capirca/lib/policy.py` iterates through keywords.
    2. When processing `source-exclude` or `destination-exclude`, the code might not correctly handle the interaction with other conditions like `source-address`, `destination-address`, `protocol`, `destination-port`, etc.
    3. For example, consider a term:
       ```
       term test-exclude {
         source-address:: NET-A
         source-exclude:: NET-B
         destination-address:: NET-C
         protocol:: tcp
         destination-port:: HTTP
         action:: accept
       }
       ```
    4. If the parser incorrectly processes `source-exclude` in combination with `destination-address`, `protocol` and `destination-port`, it might generate rules that allow traffic from `NET-A` to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp` regardless of the `source-exclude NET-B` condition.
    5. The vulnerability could be in the code that translates the abstract policy terms into concrete ACL rules for specific platforms within the generator libraries (e.g., `cisco.py`, `juniper.py`, etc.).
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a network definition file (`test_net.net`) with the following content in the `def` directory:
       ```
       NET-A = 10.0.0.0/24
       NET-B = 10.0.0.0/28
       NET-C = 20.0.0.0/24
       ```
    2. Create a service definition file (`test_svc.svc`) with the following content in the `def` directory:
       ```
       HTTP = 80/tcp
       ```
    3. Create a malicious policy file (`malicious.pol`) with the following content in the `policies/pol` directory:
       ```
       header {
         target:: cisco test-acl extended
       }

       term test-exclude {
         source-address:: NET-A
         source-exclude:: NET-B
         destination-address:: NET-C
         protocol:: tcp
         destination-port:: HTTP
         action:: accept
       }
       ```
    4. Run Capirca to generate Cisco ACL configuration using the following command from the project root:
       ```bash
       ~/.local/bin/aclgen --policy_file policies/pol/malicious.pol --definitions_directory def --output_directory output
       ```
       (Adjust `~/.local/bin/aclgen` path according to your installation)
    5. Examine the generated Cisco ACL configuration file (`output/test_acl.acl`).
    6. **Expected correct behavior:** The generated ACL should *not* permit traffic from `NET-B` (10.0.0.0/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`. It should only permit traffic from the rest of `NET-A` (e.g., 10.0.0.16/28, 10.0.0.32/27, ... , 10.0.0.224/27, 10.0.0.256/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`.
    7. **Vulnerability confirmation:** If the generated ACL *incorrectly* permits traffic from `NET-B` (10.0.0.0/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`, it confirms the vulnerability. To further confirm, deploy this ACL on a Cisco device (or simulator) and test connectivity:
        - Attempt to establish a TCP connection to port 80 on a host in `20.0.0.0/24` from a source host in `10.0.0.0/28`. If the connection is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.
        - Attempt to establish a TCP connection to port 80 on a host in `20.0.0.0/24` from a source host in `10.0.0.16/28`. If the connection is successful, this is expected behavior.
