## Combined Vulnerability List

### Insufficient Input Validation in Definition Files

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Input Validation in Definition Files
- **Description:**
  1. An attacker gains the ability to modify object definition files (`.net`, `.svc`).
  2. The attacker injects malicious data into these files, such as invalid IP addresses, malformed service definitions, or unexpected characters in token names.
  3. Capirca processes these modified definition files. Due to insufficient input validation, the malicious data is parsed and incorporated into the policy object.
  4. When ACL configurations are generated, the malicious data is translated into firewall rules.
  5. These injected rules could bypass intended security controls, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.
- **Impact:** An attacker could inject arbitrary firewall rules by manipulating definition files, leading to unauthorized network access and bypassing security policies.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Procedural mitigation: The README.md states "The Capirca threat model assumes some control and verification of policy definitions". It is recommended to test generated ACLs before production.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implement input validation for token names and definitions in `.net` and `.svc` files.
    - Validate IP address formats and ranges in `.net` files.
    - Validate port numbers and protocol names in `.svc` files.
    - Sanitize token names to prevent injection of control characters or potentially harmful names.
    - Implement error handling for invalid input formats in definition files to prevent parsing errors or misinterpretations.
- **Preconditions:**
  - Attacker needs write access to the object definition files (`.net`, `.svc`) used by Capirca.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. File: `/code/capirca/lib/naming.py`
  2. Functions: `ParseNetworkList(self, data)` and `ParseServiceList(self, data)` parse `.net` and `.svc` files.
  3. **Network parsing (`ParseNetworkList`)**:
     - Iterates through lines, splits by `=`, token is before `=`, definitions after `=`.
     - Uses `nacaddr.IP` for basic IP format validation, but no token name validation or comprehensive range validation.
  4. **Service parsing (`ParseServiceList`)**:
     - Similar structure to `ParseNetworkList`.
     - Splits lines, token before `=`, service definitions after `=`.
     - Minimal validation on `port_proto` format, no token name validation.
  5. **Vulnerability**: Lack of input validation in `ParseNetworkList` and `ParseServiceList` allows injection of malicious data via definition files, as token names and definitions are not strictly validated beyond basic format checks.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Setup:
     - Set up Capirca environment with sample policy and definition files.
     - Modify `def/NETWORK.net` to include:
       ```
       MALICIOUS_NET = 1.2.3.4/32 # Malicious Network
       INJECTED_CMD = `$(malicious_command)` # Attempt command injection (benign in this context)
       INVALID_IP = 999.999.999.999/32 # Invalid IP address
       ```
     - Create `policies/test_injection.pol`:
       ```pol
       header {
         target:: cisco test-injection
       }

       term malicious-term {
         source-address:: MALICIOUS_NET
         destination-address:: ANY
         action:: accept
         comment:: "Injected malicious rule"
       }

       term invalid-ip-term {
         source-address:: INVALID_IP
         destination-address:: ANY
         comment:: "Term with invalid IP"
       }
       ```
  2. Run Capirca:
     ```bash
     ./aclgen --policy_file policies/test_injection.pol --output_directory ./filters_test_injection --definitions_directory ./def
     ```
  3. Analyze Output (`filters_test_injection/test_injection.acl`):
     - Vulnerable Expected Result: ACL generated without errors, including rule for `MALICIOUS_NET` (1.2.3.4/32). `INVALID_IP` term ideally skipped or warned about, but no crashes. `INJECTED_CMD` treated as comment.
     - Mitigated Expected Result: Capirca reports error/warning for `INVALID_IP`, skips `invalid-ip-term`. `INJECTED_CMD` ignored. ACL generated (potentially partial/warning-annotated), preventing rules based on invalid definitions.
  4. Conclusion: If ACL generated with `malicious-term` and no errors for `INVALID_IP`, it validates insufficient input validation vulnerability, enabling policy injection via definition files.

### Path Traversal via Policy File Inclusion

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal via Policy File Inclusion
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains access to the system managing policy definition files (`.pol` files). This could be achieved through various means such as compromising a user account with write access to the policy file repository, exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that manage these files (e.g., version control systems, shared file systems), or through social engineering.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious policy file (`.pol`) containing an `#include` directive designed to access files outside the intended 'includes/' subdirectory. For example, the attacker could insert `#include '../malicious_include.inc'` or `#include '../../../../sensitive_file.inc'`.
    3. The Capirca tool is executed to generate ACL configurations, processing the attacker's malicious policy file.
    4. If the tool fails to properly sanitize or validate the include path, it may follow the attacker-provided path and include files from unintended locations.
    5. This could lead to the inclusion of:
        - Malicious policy terms from attacker-controlled files, allowing injection of arbitrary ACL rules.
        - Sensitive data from files outside the policy directory, if the included file content is somehow exposed or processed by Capirca in a way that reveals its content (less likely but possible depending on how includes are processed).
    6. When the generated ACL configurations are deployed to network devices, the injected malicious rules could weaken network security, grant unauthorized access, or disrupt network operations, depending on the content of the malicious include file.
- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary ACL rules into network configurations generated by Capirca. This can lead to significant security breaches, including unauthorized network access, data exfiltration, and disruption of services. The impact depends on the attacker's ability to craft effective malicious rules and the scope of the deployed ACLs.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation in `README.md` and `doc/generators_patterns.md` mentions that "Includes are only read from the subdirectories of your base_directory, all other directories will error out." This suggests an attempt to restrict include paths to prevent traversal. However, the provided files do not contain the source code that enforces this restriction, so the effectiveness of this mitigation cannot be verified from these files alone.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The project is missing explicit input validation and sanitization of the include path in the `#include` directive processing logic. It should strictly validate that the included file path is within the allowed 'includes/' subdirectory of the base policy directory and reject any paths attempting to traverse outside of it or using absolute paths.
    - **Path Canonicalization:** Before attempting to include a file, the include path should be canonicalized to resolve symbolic links and remove path components like `..` and `.`. This would prevent attackers from bypassing path validation using directory traversal sequences.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The process running Capirca should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to access policy and definition files. This would limit the impact if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited, as the attacker would only be able to access files that the Capirca process itself has access to.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. Attacker needs write access to the policy definition files (`.pol`, `.net`, `.svc`) or the system managing them.
    2. Capirca tool must be configured to process the attacker-modified policy file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: /code/README.md**
        - The README.md file describes the `#include` directive and mentions the restriction to subdirectories of the `base_directory`.
        ```markdown
        NOTE: Includes are only read from the subdirectories of your base_directory,
        all other directories will error out.
        ```
        - This is the only indication of a mitigation related to include paths in the provided documentation.

    - **File: /code/doc/generators_patterns.md**
        - This file does not provide any information related to include directive security.

    - **Other Files:**
        - The rest of the provided files (generator documentation, setup files, test files, etc.) do not contain information relevant to the `#include` directive's implementation or security.
        - The provided files lack the core parsing logic (likely in `lib/policy.py` or related files, which are not fully provided), so it's impossible to analyze how the `#include` directive is actually processed and if the subdirectory restriction is implemented and correctly enforced in the code.

    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User (Attacker) --> Policy File Repository --> Malicious .pol File (with #include '../...')
                                    |
                                    V
        Capirca Tool -------> Policy Parser (Processes #include directive)

        ACL Configuration Generation --> Deployed to Network Devices (Malicious Rules)
        ```

    - **Code Walkthrough (Conceptual - based on documentation, actual code not available):**
        1. The `policy.ParsePolicy` function (or related parsing functions) in `policy.py` likely handles the parsing of `.pol` files.
        2. When the parser encounters an `#include` directive, it extracts the file path.
        3. **Vulnerability Point:** The parser needs to validate the extracted file path. It should:
            - Check if the path is relative or absolute. Absolute paths should be rejected.
            - If relative, it should resolve the path relative to the base policy directory, and then verify if the resolved path is still within a designated 'includes/' subdirectory (or similar allowed location) under the base directory.
            - It should prevent directory traversal sequences like `..` in the path.
        4. If the path is validated, the parser reads the content of the included file and injects it into the policy at the location of the `#include` directive.
        5. If validation is missing or insufficient, a path traversal vulnerability exists.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume you have a Capirca project setup with a base policy directory (e.g., `./policies`) and a definitions directory (e.g., `./def`).
        - Create an 'includes' subdirectory within the policy directory (e.g., `./policies/includes/`).
        - Place a legitimate include file (e.g., `legitimate.inc`) inside the 'includes' directory.
        - Create a sensitive file outside the policy directory but accessible by the user running Capirca (e.g., `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`) containing some identifiable content like "THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA".
        - Create a malicious include file (e.g., `malicious_include.inc`) within the 'includes' directory that, for testing purposes, attempts to include the sensitive file:
          ```
          # malicious_include.inc
          #include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'
          ```
        - Alternatively, for a simpler test without creating a malicious include file, directly embed the path traversal in the main policy file.

    2. **Craft Malicious Policy File:**
        - Create a new policy file (e.g., `policies/pol/malicious_policy.pol`) with the following content:
          ```
          header {
            target:: juniper test-filter inet
          }

          term test-include {
            action:: accept
            verbatim:: juniper "This is before included content:"
            verbatim:: juniper "#include '../malicious_include.inc'"  # or #include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'
            verbatim:: juniper "This is after included content:"
          }
          ```
           - Or directly:
          ```
          header {
            target:: juniper test-filter inet
          }

          term test-include {
            action:: accept
            verbatim:: juniper "This is before included content:"
            verbatim:: juniper "#include '../../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt'"
            verbatim:: juniper "This is after included content:"
          }
          ```

    3. **Run Capirca:**
        - Execute the Capirca tool to generate ACLs, targeting the malicious policy file:
          ```bash
          ./aclgen --policy_file policies/pol/malicious_policy.pol --output_directory ./filters
          ```

    4. **Analyze Output:**
        - Examine the generated output file (e.g., `filters/test_filter.jcl` for Juniper).
        - **Check for Sensitive Data Inclusion:** If the path traversal is successful and includes `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`, the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` ("THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA") might be present in the generated ACL configuration, likely within the `verbatim` sections of the `test-include` term or potentially causing parser errors if the included content is not valid policy syntax.
        - **Check for Error Messages:** If the tool correctly prevents path traversal, it should output an error message indicating an invalid include path or restricted directory access, and the sensitive data should not be included in the output.

    5. **Expected Results (Vulnerable Case):**
        - The generated ACL configuration will contain the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` (or parser errors due to invalid content if directly including a non-policy file).
        - This confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the tool included a file from outside the intended policy directory due to the `#include` directive.

    6. **Expected Results (Mitigated Case):**
        - The Capirca tool will output an error message related to invalid include path or directory restriction.
        - The generated ACL configuration will *not* contain the content of `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`.
        - This indicates that the path traversal vulnerability is mitigated, and the tool correctly restricts include paths.

    7. **Rank Adjustment (If Mitigated):** If the test shows that the vulnerability is mitigated (step 6), the vulnerability rank should be adjusted to Low or Medium (depending on the strength of the mitigation and potential for bypass), or the vulnerability should be removed from the list if the mitigation is deemed fully effective. Deeper code analysis would be needed to confirm the robustness of the mitigation.

### Improper Handling of Exclude Keywords Leading to Permissive Rules

- **Vulnerability Name:** Improper Handling of Exclude Keywords Leading to Permissive Rules
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious policy file that uses `source-exclude` or `destination-exclude` in combination with other complex term conditions (e.g., multiple source/destination addresses, ports, protocols).
    2. Due to a parsing or logical flaw in Capirca, the exclude conditions are not correctly applied when combined with other conditions.
    3. Capirca generates firewall configurations where the exclusion is ineffective or partially effective, leading to rules that are more permissive than intended by the policy author.
    4. A user, unaware of the vulnerability, processes this malicious policy file using Capirca.
    5. The generated firewall configuration is deployed, unintentionally allowing traffic that should have been blocked by the exclude condition.
- **Impact:**
    - Network access control bypass. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to network resources due to overly permissive firewall rules.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None apparent from the provided documentation files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust parsing and validation of policy files, especially when using exclude keywords in combination with complex conditions.
    - Security testing focused on edge cases and complex policy combinations to ensure correct rule generation.
    - Input sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks (though less relevant to this specific vulnerability).
    - Code review focusing on the logic handling exclude keywords and complex term conditions.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can trick a user into using a maliciously crafted policy file.
    - User has Capirca installed and uses it to generate firewall configurations.
    - User deploys the generated firewall configurations.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    (Hypothetical - Source code access needed for accurate analysis)
    1. Assume the parsing logic for `term` blocks in `capirca/lib/policy.py` iterates through keywords.
    2. When processing `source-exclude` or `destination-exclude`, the code might not correctly handle the interaction with other conditions like `source-address`, `destination-address`, `protocol`, `destination-port`, etc.
    3. For example, consider a term:
       ```
       term test-exclude {
         source-address:: NET-A
         source-exclude:: NET-B
         destination-address:: NET-C
         protocol:: tcp
         destination-port:: HTTP
         action:: accept
       }
       ```
    4. If the parser incorrectly processes `source-exclude` in combination with `destination-address`, `protocol` and `destination-port`, it might generate rules that allow traffic from `NET-A` to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp` regardless of the `source-exclude NET-B` condition.
    5. The vulnerability could be in the code that translates the abstract policy terms into concrete ACL rules for specific platforms within the generator libraries (e.g., `cisco.py`, `juniper.py`, etc.).
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a network definition file (`test_net.net`) with the following content in the `def` directory:
       ```
       NET-A = 10.0.0.0/24
       NET-B = 10.0.0.0/28
       NET-C = 20.0.0.0/24
       ```
    2. Create a service definition file (`test_svc.svc`) with the following content in the `def` directory:
       ```
       HTTP = 80/tcp
       ```
    3. Create a malicious policy file (`malicious.pol`) with the following content in the `policies/pol` directory:
       ```
       header {
         target:: cisco test-acl extended
       }

       term test-exclude {
         source-address:: NET-A
         source-exclude:: NET-B
         destination-address:: NET-C
         protocol:: tcp
         destination-port:: HTTP
         action:: accept
       }
       ```
    4. Run Capirca to generate Cisco ACL configuration using the following command from the project root:
       ```bash
       ~/.local/bin/aclgen --policy_file policies/pol/malicious.pol --definitions_directory def --output_directory output
       ```
       (Adjust `~/.local/bin/aclgen` path according to your installation)
    5. Examine the generated Cisco ACL configuration file (`output/test_acl.acl`).
    6. **Expected correct behavior:** The generated ACL should *not* permit traffic from `NET-B` (10.0.0.0/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`. It should only permit traffic from the rest of `NET-A` (e.g., 10.0.0.16/28, 10.0.0.32/27, ... , 10.0.0.224/27, 10.0.0.256/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`.
    7. **Vulnerability confirmation:** If the generated ACL *incorrectly* permits traffic from `NET-B` (10.0.0.0/28) to `NET-C:HTTP/tcp`, it confirms the vulnerability. To further confirm, deploy this ACL on a Cisco device (or simulator) and test connectivity:
        - Attempt to establish a TCP connection to port 80 on a host in `20.0.0.0/24` from a source host in `10.0.0.0/28`. If the connection is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.
        - Attempt to establish a TCP connection to port 80 on a host in `20.0.0.0/24` from a source host in `10.0.0.16/28`. If the connection is successful, this is expected behavior.
