### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via Non-Public API Data Leakage
* Description:
    1. The library is designed to access undocumented, non-public GitHub API endpoints.
    2. These endpoints are not officially supported and their response structure and data content are not guaranteed to be stable or secure for public consumption.
    3. The library fetches data from these endpoints and processes it, potentially including sensitive information that is not intended for public access.
    4. If the library or applications using it do not properly sanitize or handle the data retrieved from these non-public APIs, sensitive information could be inadvertently exposed through logs, error messages, or insecure data handling practices in consuming applications.
    5. Changes in GitHub's non-public APIs could also lead to new, unexpected sensitive data being included in responses, which the library might not be designed to handle securely, increasing the risk of information leakage.
* Impact:
    * Exposure of sensitive information obtained from non-public GitHub APIs. This could include organizational details, internal configurations, usage statistics, or other data not meant for public knowledge.
    * Unauthorized access to information that could potentially be used for reconnaissance or further attacks against GitHub organizations or users.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The provided code does not include any specific mitigations for handling sensitive data from non-public APIs. The library focuses on fetching and submitting forms without explicit data sanitization or security considerations for API responses.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Data Sanitization:** Implement sanitization and validation of data received from non-public APIs before it is processed, logged, or returned to the user application. This should include identifying and removing or masking potentially sensitive information.
    * **Secure Logging Practices:** Avoid logging raw API responses, especially in production environments. If logging is necessary, ensure sensitive data is scrubbed from logs. Implement logging configurations that minimize the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    * **Error Handling and Data Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive data from being exposed in error messages or during unexpected API responses. Ensure that data structures and handling mechanisms used in the library are designed to minimize the risk of accidental data leakage.
    * **Documentation and Warnings:** Clearly document the risks associated with using this library, particularly the reliance on non-public APIs. Warn users about the potential for information disclosure and the need for careful handling of data retrieved using this library. Advise users to implement their own security measures when using this library in applications that handle sensitive data.
* Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to have access to an application or system that utilizes this library to interact with GitHub's non-public APIs.
    * The application must be configured to perform actions that retrieve data from non-public API endpoints using the library.
    * The vulnerability is triggered when the non-public API returns sensitive data and this data is not properly handled by the library or the application, leading to its exposure.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * **`github_nonpublic_api/api.py`**:
        * The functions `_get_and_submit_form` and `_get_url_with_session` are core functions for interacting with GitHub URLs. They fetch content using `requests.get` and `requests.post` and parse HTML using `html5lib`.
        * The library uses hardcoded URLs (e.g., `_CREATE_ORG_URL`, `_INSTALL_APP_URL`, `_UPDATE_SECURITY_ANALYSIS_URL`) that point to non-public GitHub API endpoints.
        * The responses from these non-public APIs are treated as standard HTML forms, and data is extracted based on form input names and values. There is no explicit check or sanitization of the content of these responses for sensitive data.
        * The `logging.info` calls in `_get_and_submit_form` and `_get_url_with_session` log the URLs being fetched. If verbose logging is enabled, these logs could potentially contain sensitive information if non-public API URLs themselves contain sensitive parameters or if URL paths are considered sensitive.
        * Example in `download_dormant_users_report`: It parses the page content using regex to find a download link, but it does not analyze the content for sensitive data before returning it to the caller.
        * The library's design focuses on functionality (accessing non-public APIs) without incorporating security measures to protect potentially sensitive data retrieved from these APIs.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Install the library and its dependencies in a test environment.
        * Configure the library with valid GitHub credentials (username, password, and optionally OTP).
        * Set up basic logging to capture HTTP requests and responses (or examine responses directly in the test).
    2. **Execution:**
        * Use the `Api` class to call a function that interacts with a non-public API endpoint. For example, use `api.request_usage(enterprise_name='test-enterprise', days=7)` or `api.request_dormant_users_report(enterprise_name='test-enterprise')`. Replace `'test-enterprise'` with a valid enterprise name if needed for the test to execute without errors related to permissions or invalid names.
        * Observe the HTTP requests made by the library and the responses received from GitHub. You can use network interception tools or examine the `response.text` attribute in test code if you modify the library to expose responses.
    3. **Verification:**
        * Examine the HTTP responses and logs for any signs of sensitive data that should not be publicly accessible. Look for patterns that might indicate exposure of internal GitHub information, user details, or organizational configurations within the HTML content or headers of the responses.
        * Specifically, check the content returned by functions like `download_usage_report` or `download_dormant_users_report` if you can successfully trigger them. These reports, even if dummy in a test scenario, could reveal the type of data the non-public APIs might expose.
        * If possible, try to access non-public API endpoints directly using a tool like `curl` or `Postman` with authenticated credentials to further investigate the type of data these APIs might return and assess the potential sensitivity of this data.

This test case is designed to highlight the potential for information disclosure by observing the data retrieved from non-public APIs. It relies on manual inspection of responses, as without more context on *exactly* what sensitive data *could* be returned by these undocumented APIs, automated detection is challenging. The key is to demonstrate that the library retrieves data from non-public sources without explicit security measures to handle potentially sensitive information.
