### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Type error due to incompatible leaf data types in binary operations
- Description:
    1. A user creates two `tree_math.Vector` instances, `v1` and `v2`, with incompatible data types in corresponding leaves of their underlying pytrees. For example, `v1` could have an integer leaf and `v2` a string leaf at the same tree location.
    2. The user performs a binary operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) between `v1` and `v2`.
    3. The `broadcasting_map` function, used for binary operations in `tree-math`, applies the operation to corresponding leaves of `v1` and `v2` using `jax.tree_util.tree_map`.
    4. If the operation is not defined or not compatible between the data types of the corresponding leaves (e.g., adding an integer and a string), a `TypeError` exception is raised by Python or JAX during the leaf-wise operation within `tree_util.tree_map`.
    5. This exception is not explicitly handled by `tree-math`, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior in the user's application if it does not anticipate and handle `TypeError` exceptions when using `tree-math` operations.
- Impact:
    - The application using `tree-math` may crash due to an unhandled `TypeError` exception.
    - Users might experience unexpected behavior if they assume that `tree-math` operations will gracefully handle or validate input data types, leading to potential data corruption or incorrect results if exceptions are not properly caught in user code.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not perform any explicit type checking or input validation to ensure that the data types within the pytree leaves of `tree_math.Vector` instances are compatible for the intended mathematical operations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation should be added to the `Vector` class or within the binary operation functions to check for data type compatibility before performing operations on the leaves.
    - Alternatively, type casting could be implemented to coerce leaves to a compatible type if feasible and semantically correct for the library's use cases. If automatic casting is not desired, clear error messages indicating the type incompatibility should be raised by `tree-math` itself instead of letting raw `TypeError` exceptions propagate.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must provide two `tree_math.Vector` instances as operands for a binary operation.
    - These `tree_math.Vector` instances must have underlying pytrees with corresponding leaves that have data types incompatible with the binary operation being performed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability occurs in the binary operations defined in `tree_math._src.vector.VectorMixin` (and consequently in `tree_math.Vector`).
    - These operations rely on `tree_math._src.vector.broadcasting_map`.
    - `broadcasting_map` utilizes `jax.tree_util.tree_map` to apply the given binary function (`func`) to the leaves of the input `Vector` instances.
    - **File: /code/tree_math/_src/vector.py**
    ```python
    def broadcasting_map(func, *args):
      """Like tree_map, but scalar arguments are broadcast to all leaves."""
      static_argnums = [
          i for i, x in enumerate(args) if not isinstance(x, VectorMixin)
      ]
      func2, vector_args = _argnums_partial(func, args, static_argnums)
      for arg in args:
        if not isinstance(arg, VectorMixin):
          shape = jnp.shape(arg)
          if shape:
            raise TypeError(
                f"non-tree_math.VectorMixin argument is not a scalar: {arg!r}"
            )
      if not vector_args:
        return func2()  # result is a scalar
      _flatten_together(*[arg for arg in vector_args])  # check shapes
      return tree_util.tree_map(func2, *vector_args)
    ```
    - As seen in the code, `broadcasting_map` only checks if non-`VectorMixin` arguments are scalars. It does not validate the data types of the leaves within the `VectorMixin` arguments.
    - When `tree_util.tree_map(func2, *vector_args)` is executed, `func2` (which is the operator like `operator.add`) is directly applied to the corresponding leaves. If these leaves have incompatible types, a `TypeError` will be raised by the underlying Python or JAX operations, which is not caught or handled by `tree-math`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Python file, e.g., `test_incompatible_types.py`.
    2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```python
    import tree_math as tm
    import jax.numpy as jnp

    try:
        v1 = tm.Vector({'a': 1, 'b': jnp.array([2, 3])})
        v2 = tm.Vector({'a': 'str', 'b': jnp.array([4.0, 5.0])})
        result = v1 + v2
        print("Vulnerability test failed: No TypeError raised.")
        print("Result:", result)
    except TypeError as e:
        print("Vulnerability test passed: TypeError raised as expected.")
        print("Error details:", e)
        assert "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'" in str(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Vulnerability test error: Unexpected exception raised:", e)
        raise

    try:
        v3 = tm.Vector({'x': jnp.array([1, 2]), 'y': 3})
        v4 = tm.Vector({'x': jnp.array(['a', 'b']), 'y': 4.0})
        result = v3 * v4
        print("Vulnerability test failed: No TypeError raised for multiplication.")
        print("Result:", result)
    except TypeError as e:
        print("Vulnerability test passed: TypeError raised for multiplication as expected.")
        print("Error details:", e)
        assert "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'str'" in str(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Vulnerability test error: Unexpected exception raised for multiplication:", e)
        raise
    ```
    3. Run the Python file: `python test_incompatible_types.py`.
    4. Observe the output. The test should pass, indicating a `TypeError` is raised when attempting to add or multiply `tree_math.Vector` instances with incompatible leaf types, confirming the vulnerability. The output should contain messages indicating "Vulnerability test passed: TypeError raised as expected." for both addition and multiplication, along with error details that include "unsupported operand type(s)".
