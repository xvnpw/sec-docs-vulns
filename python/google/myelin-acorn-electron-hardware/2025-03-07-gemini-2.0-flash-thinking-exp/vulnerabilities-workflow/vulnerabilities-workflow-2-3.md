### Vulnerability 1: Potential Buffer Overflow in UPURS USB Serial Port Firmware

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Buffer Overflow in `upurs_usb_port` serial receive handling.
*   **Description:** The `upurs_usb_port` firmware, designed for an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller, handles serial data received over USB. A buffer overflow vulnerability could occur in the serial data handling routine if incoming data is not properly validated and exceeds the buffer size. An attacker could send a specially crafted long string via USB serial to the `upurs_usb_port` device. If the firmware's serial receive buffer overflows, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller, and potentially compromise the retro computer system connected to it.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller. This could allow an attacker to control the serial communication with the retro computer, potentially leading to further exploitation of the retro system itself.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None apparent from the provided project files.
*   **Missing Mitigations:** Input validation and bounds checking on the serial data received via USB. Implement safe buffer handling functions like `strncpy` or `fgets` with buffer size limits to prevent overflows.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   User builds and flashes the `upurs_usb_port` firmware onto an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller.
    *   The hardware is connected to a retro Acorn Electron or BBC Micro computer.
    *   An attacker can send data via USB serial to the `upurs_usb_port` device.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   Unfortunately, the source code for `upurs_usb_port` project is not provided within the PROJECT FILES. Without the source code of `upurs_usb_port.ino`, a detailed step-by-step source code analysis is not possible. However, based on the description and typical patterns in serial handling code, the vulnerability likely resides in the serial data reception and processing logic. Standard Arduino `Serial.read()` functions often require manual buffer management to avoid overflows. If the `upurs_usb_port.ino` code uses a fixed-size buffer to store incoming serial data and doesn't check the length of the incoming data before writing to the buffer, a buffer overflow vulnerability is highly probable.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Build the `upurs_usb_port` firmware and flash it onto an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller.
    2.  Connect the ATMEGA32U4 hardware to a host computer via USB serial.
    3.  Open a serial terminal or use a script to send data to the serial port of the ATMEGA32U4.
    4.  Send a string longer than the expected buffer size in the `upurs_usb_port` firmware (e.g., several hundred or thousands of characters).
    5.  Observe the behavior of the ATMEGA32U4 device and the connected retro computer. A successful buffer overflow exploit might manifest as:
        *   Device crash or unexpected reset.
        *   Corruption of data being sent to the retro computer.
        *   Changes in the expected serial communication behavior.
        *   In a more advanced scenario, arbitrary code execution could be verified by attempting to leak memory or control output pins after sending the oversized string.

### Vulnerability 2: Potential Buffer Overflow in Emulated Keyboard Firmware

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Buffer Overflow in `emulated_keyboard` keyboard input processing.
*   **Description:** The `emulated_keyboard` firmware, intended for a Pro Micro (ATMEGA32U4) and CPLD, processes keyboard input received via Pygame and forwards it to a BBC Master 128. A buffer overflow could occur in the firmware if the handling of keyboard input from Pygame doesn't include proper bounds checking. If an attacker can somehow influence the keyboard input processing (though less likely in this direct USB-to-retro-computer scenario compared to network-based attacks), sending excessively long or malformed keyboard input sequences could potentially overflow internal buffers within the `prototype_firmware.ino` code. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Pro Micro.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Pro Micro microcontroller. While the attack vector is less direct than in `upurs_usb_port` (as it relies on manipulating Pygame input, which is typically locally controlled), a vulnerability here is still concerning if the firmware is intended to be robust against unexpected input scenarios.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None apparent from the provided project files.
*   **Missing Mitigations:** Input validation and sanitization of keyboard data received from Pygame within the `prototype_firmware.ino` code. Implement buffer overflow protection measures in keyboard input handling routines.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   User programs both the CPLD (`prototype_cpld/`) and Pro Micro (`prototype_firmware/`) with the provided code.
    *   `prototype_keyboard_sender.py` is run on a host computer.
    *   The Pro Micro hardware is connected to a BBC Master 128 motherboard.
    *   An attacker could theoretically try to influence the input to `prototype_keyboard_sender.py` or directly craft input that exploits vulnerabilities in `prototype_firmware.ino` keyboard processing.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   Similar to `upurs_usb_port`, the source code of `prototype_firmware.ino` is not directly provided in PROJECT FILES. Without the code, a precise analysis is not possible. However, if `prototype_firmware.ino` directly processes Pygame keyboard events and stores them in fixed-size buffers without sufficient size checks, it could be vulnerable to buffer overflows. For example, if key press events are concatenated into a command string buffer without validation, sending a very large number of key presses could cause a buffer overflow.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Program the XC9572XL CPLD with the code in `prototype_cpld/`.
    2.  Program the Pro Micro with the code in `prototype_firmware/`.
    3.  Run `prototype_keyboard_sender.py` on a host computer and connect a USB keyboard.
    4.  In `prototype_keyboard_sender.py`, attempt to simulate or inject a very long sequence of key presses (e.g., programmatically generate and send hundreds or thousands of key press events rapidly).
    5.  Observe the behavior of the Pro Micro and the connected BBC Master 128. A buffer overflow might be indicated by:
        *   Pro Micro device crashing or resetting.
        *   Erratic keyboard behavior on the BBC Master 128.
        *   Failure of `prototype_keyboard_sender.py` due to communication errors with the Pro Micro.
        *   In more advanced cases, attempt to trigger specific code execution by crafting particular keyboard input sequences if more details about the firmware's input handling were known.
