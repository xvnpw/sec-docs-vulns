### List of High and Critical Vulnerabilities

- **Vulnerability Name:** CPU Socket Overvoltage
  - **Description:** An attacker could modify the `cpu_socket_expansion` hardware design to incorrectly route the 5V power supply to a pin on the CPU socket intended for a 3.3V signal or ground. If a user builds this malicious design and plugs it into their Acorn Electron or BBC computer, the overvoltage could cause permanent damage to the CPU or other motherboard components. This could be achieved by altering the PCB layout or schematic files to create a direct connection between a 5V pin and a pin connected to the CPU's 3.3V rail or a ground pin.
  - **Impact:** Critical hardware damage to the retro computer, potentially rendering it unusable. Damage could include CPU burnout, motherboard trace damage, or failure of other components.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The project provides hardware designs without any built-in security measures against malicious modifications.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Design review process: Implement a thorough review process for all hardware designs to identify and prevent potentially harmful configurations.
    - Security guidelines: Provide clear security guidelines for users, emphasizing the risks of using hardware designs from untrusted sources.

    - The user plugs the built board into the CPU socket of their retro computer and powers it on.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    - Vulnerability is in hardware design files (schematic and PCB layout), not in software source code files provided.
    - To analyse, review schematic for `cpu_socket_expansion` project (files not provided in PROJECT FILES, but assumed to exist within the project structure).
    - Look for direct connections between 5V input pins and pins on the CPU socket that should be connected to 3.3V or ground.
    - Review PCB layout to ensure no unintended shorts are introduced that could route 5V to incorrect pins on the CPU socket.
  - **Security test case:**

    8. User: Powers on the retro computer.
    9. Expected result: The retro computer fails to boot, exhibits erratic behavior, or the CPU chip is visibly damaged (overheating, smoke, etc.) due to overvoltage.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Power Distribution Overvoltage
  - **Description:** An attacker could maliciously alter the `bbc_power_distribution` hardware design to cause the voltage regulator to output an incorrect and damaging voltage, such as +12V instead of +5V or generate a reversed -5V supply. If a user builds this compromised board, it could deliver excessive voltage to the retro computer's motherboard, leading to component failure. This can be achieved by modifying the voltage regulator circuit in the schematic or PCB layout to change the voltage feedback resistors or the regulator IC itself to a higher voltage variant.
  - **Impact:** High risk of hardware damage to the retro computer's motherboard and components. Overvoltage can destroy sensitive ICs, capacitors, and other circuitry.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The project lacks any safeguards against intentional voltage misconfiguration.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Design verification: Implement design verification steps to ensure the power distribution circuit correctly outputs the intended voltages.
    - Component selection review: Review and lock down the specific voltage regulator components to prevent easy substitution with higher voltage variants.

    4. Attacker: Upload the modified design files.
    5. User: Download the modified design files.
    6. User: Builds the modified `bbc_power_distribution` board.
    7. User: Connects the modified board to a 5V power supply and a BBC Model B or Master motherboard.
    8. User: Powers on the system.
    9. Expected result: The retro computer components are damaged due to incorrect power supply voltages. Smoke, overheating, or complete system failure may occur.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cartridge/Expansion Board Short Circuit
  - **Description:** An attacker could intentionally introduce a short circuit in the design of any cartridge or expansion board (e.g., `32kb_flash_cartridge`, `minus_one`, `expansion_minispartan_breakout`). This short circuit, typically between power and ground pins on the cartridge or expansion connector, would directly short circuit the retro computer's power supply when the board is plugged in. Building and using such a maliciously designed board could lead to damage to the computer's power supply and potentially other components due to excessive current flow. This can be achieved by manipulating the PCB layout files to create unintended copper traces connecting power and ground pins on the edge connector footprint.
  - **Impact:** High risk of hardware damage, primarily to the retro computer's power supply unit (PSU). A severe short circuit could also damage motherboard components or traces due to excessive current.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The project lacks any mechanisms to prevent short circuits in user-built boards from modified designs.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Design rule checks (DRC): Implement and enforce stricter DRC during design to flag potential short circuits, although malicious shorts might be intentionally designed to pass basic DRC.
    - User education: Educate users about the risks of short circuits and the importance of careful PCB assembly and inspection.
    - Warnings: Include explicit warnings in project documentation and build instructions about the dangers of short circuits and the need to verify gerber files and assembled boards against the original design before use.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker gains access to cartridge or expansion board design files.
    - Attacker modifies PCB layout to create a short circuit between power and ground pins on the connector.
    - User downloads the malicious design files.
    - User builds the cartridge or expansion board based on the modified design.
    - User plugs the board into their retro computer.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    - Vulnerability is in hardware PCB layout files for various cartridge/expansion board projects (e.g., `32kb_flash_cartridge`, `minus_one`, `expansion_minispartan_breakout`).
    - Analyse PCB layout files using a PCB design software.
    - Inspect the copper traces around the cartridge or expansion connector footprint for unintended direct connections between power (5V or 3.3V) and GND pins.
    - Verify that design rule checks are enabled and configured to detect short circuits, but note that intentional malicious shorts may be designed to bypass standard DRC.
  - **Security test case:**
    1. Attacker: Download the design files for `32kb_flash_cartridge`.
    2. Attacker: Open the PCB layout file and draw a copper trace directly connecting the 5V pin to a GND pin on the cartridge edge connector footprint.
    3. Attacker: Generate gerber files for the modified design.
    4. Attacker: Upload the modified design files.
    5. User: Download the modified design files.
    6. User: Fabricates the PCB and assembles the `32kb_flash_cartridge` board.
    7. User: Plugs the modified cartridge into a retro Acorn Electron cartridge slot or Plus 1 expansion.
    8. User: Powers on the retro computer.
    9. Expected result: The retro computer's power supply trips immediately upon power-on, or the power supply or components on the motherboard are damaged due to the short circuit.

- **Vulnerability Name:** XC9500XL Breakout Board v1 Power Pin Errata
  - **Description:** The v1 version of the XC9500XL breakout board has an errata where the 5V and 0V pins are marked incorrectly on the power header. If a user builds the v1 board and connects power according to the markings on the PCB, they will reverse the power supply, potentially damaging the CPLD or the connected vintage computer system if the board is used in an expansion.
  - **Impact:** High. Reverse polarity can damage electronic components, potentially destroying the CPLD or damaging the vintage computer system it is connected to.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** The vulnerability is documented in the `xc9500xl_44_breakout/README.md` file under the "Errata" section.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Hardware Mitigation: Revision v2 of the board should correct the PCB marking error. Making v2 the primary and recommended design would mitigate this.
    - Software/Documentation Mitigation: Prominently display the errata in the README.md and potentially add a warning to the build instructions.
  - **Preconditions:** User building the v1 version of the `xc9500xl_44_breakout` board. User not carefully checking the schematic and relying only on PCB markings.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/xc9500xl_44_breakout/README.md`
    - Content:
    ```
    ## Errata

    v1 has 5V and 0V marked the wrong way around on the power pins at the top of
    the board.
    ```
    - The `README.md` file clearly states the vulnerability in the "Errata" section. This is a documentation mitigation, but not a prevention of the issue if the user doesn't read it carefully. The PCB design files for v1 are still present in the repository, which could lead to users building the flawed version.
  - **Security test case:**
    1. Download the v1 PCB design files for `xc9500xl_44_breakout`.
    2. Fabricate the v1 PCB.
    3. Connect a power supply to the power header using the markings on the PCB (5V to "5V" and 0V to "0V").
    4. Measure the voltage at the CPLD's power pins. The voltage will be reversed, with negative voltage applied to the intended positive rail and vice versa.
    5. Power on a CPLD on the board in this reversed polarity configuration. Observe if the CPLD is damaged or malfunctions.
    6. Connect the v1 board to a vintage computer expansion port with reversed polarity. Observe if the vintage computer is damaged or malfunctions.

- **Vulnerability Name:** 32kb_flash_cartridge pcb-mini PCB Error
  - **Description:** The `pcb-mini` version of the 32kb_flash_cartridge has a PCB design error where "several data lines are shorted to ground". If a user builds the `pcb-mini` board, the shorted data lines can cause malfunction of the cartridge and potentially damage the Electron computer when plugged in.
  - **Impact:** High. Shorted data lines can cause unpredictable behavior, data corruption and potentially damage the Acorn Electron hardware due to electrical faults.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** The vulnerability is documented in the `32kb_flash_cartridge/README.md` file, stating "Mini PCB built but had a PCB error.".
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Hardware Mitigation: Remove or clearly mark the `pcb-mini` design as broken and discourage its use. Provide the `pcb-standard` design as the recommended option. Correct the PCB design for `pcb-mini` and release a fixed version.
    - Software/Documentation Mitigation: Prominently display a warning in the README.md for `pcb-mini` and potentially remove the design files to prevent accidental fabrication.
  - **Preconditions:** User building the `pcb-mini` version of the `32kb_flash_cartridge`. User unaware of the PCB error.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/32kb_flash_cartridge/README.md`
    - Content:
    ```
    - [pcb-mini](pcb-mini/): This is designed to just barely protrude from
      the Plus 1 when plugged in.  Unfortunately I forgot to re-pour the
      power and ground planes before generating gerbers to send off to the
      fab, and several data lines are shorted to ground in the units that
      I have.
    ```
    - The `README.md` file clearly documents the PCB error in the `pcb-mini` design. This serves as documentation mitigation but doesn't prevent users from fabricating the flawed design.
  - **Security test case:**
    1. Download the PCB design files for `32kb_flash_cartridge/pcb-mini`.
    2. Fabricate the `pcb-mini` PCB.
    3. Using a multimeter in continuity mode, check for shorts between data lines and ground on the fabricated PCB. Confirm that "several data lines are shorted to ground".
    4. Program a flash chip with test ROM image.
    5. Plug the `pcb-mini` cartridge into an Acorn Electron.
    6. Power on the Acorn Electron. Observe if the Electron malfunctions, crashes, or exhibits data corruption due to the shorted data lines on the cartridge.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Buffer Overflow in `upurs_usb_port` serial receive handling
  - **Description:** The `upurs_usb_port` firmware, designed for an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller, handles serial data received over USB. A buffer overflow vulnerability could occur in the serial data handling routine if incoming data is not properly validated and exceeds the buffer size. An attacker could send a specially crafted long string via USB serial to the `upurs_usb_port` device. If the firmware's serial receive buffer overflows, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller, and potentially compromise the retro computer system connected to it.
  - **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller. This could allow an attacker to control the serial communication with the retro computer, potentially leading to further exploitation of the retro system itself.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** None apparent from the provided project files.
  - **Missing mitigations:** Input validation and bounds checking on the serial data received via USB. Implement safe buffer handling functions like `strncpy` or `fgets` with buffer size limits to prevent overflows.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - User builds and flashes the `upurs_usb_port` firmware onto an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller.
    - The hardware is connected to a retro Acorn Electron or BBC Micro computer.
    - An attacker can send data via USB serial to the `upurs_usb_port` device.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    - Unfortunately, the source code for `upurs_usb_port` project is not provided within the PROJECT FILES. Without the source code of `upurs_usb_port.ino`, a detailed step-by-step source code analysis is not possible. However, based on the description and typical patterns in serial handling code, the vulnerability likely resides in the serial data reception and processing logic. Standard Arduino `Serial.read()` functions often require manual buffer management to avoid overflows. If the `upurs_usb_port.ino` code uses a fixed-size buffer to store incoming serial data and doesn't check the length of the incoming data before writing to the buffer, a buffer overflow vulnerability is highly probable.
  - **Security test case:**
    1. Build the `upurs_usb_port` firmware and flash it onto an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller.
    2. Connect the ATMEGA32U4 hardware to a host computer via USB serial.
    3. Open a serial terminal or use a script to send data to the serial port of the ATMEGA32U4.
    4. Send a string longer than the expected buffer size in the `upurs_usb_port` firmware (e.g., several hundred or thousands of characters).
    5. Observe the behavior of the ATMEGA32U4 device and the connected retro computer. A successful buffer overflow exploit might manifest as:
        * Device crash or unexpected reset.
        * Corruption of data being sent to the retro computer.
        * Changes in the expected serial communication behavior.
        * In a more advanced scenario, arbitrary code execution could be verified by attempting to leak memory or control output pins after sending the oversized string.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Keystroke Injection via USB Serial Interface
  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains control of the host computer connected to the "emulated_keyboard" Pro Micro via USB.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious payload consisting of keystroke commands according to the protocol implemented in `prototype_keyboard_sender.py`.
    3. The attacker sends this payload through the USB serial interface to the Pro Micro.
    4. The Pro Micro firmware, running `prototype_firmware/prototype_firmware.ino`, receives the payload and interprets it as keyboard input.
    5. The Pro Micro communicates with the CPLD, running the design from `prototype_cpld/prototype_cpld.vhd`, via SPI to simulate keystrokes to the BBC Master 128.
    6. The BBC Master 128 interprets these injected keystrokes as legitimate keyboard input, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary commands or system compromise.
  - **Impact:**
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary keystrokes into a BBC Master 128 via the emulated keyboard, potentially bypassing intended system security measures.
    - This could allow for unauthorized command execution, data modification, or installation of malicious software on the retro system.
    - The impact is significant as it allows control over a system that is expected to be isolated or controlled through its original keyboard interface.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The provided code implements the basic functionality of keyboard emulation without any security considerations.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: The Pro Micro firmware should validate and sanitize the incoming serial data to ensure it conforms to the expected keystroke command structure and prevent injection of malicious commands.
    - Authentication/Authorization: Implement a mechanism to authenticate or authorize the host computer sending keystrokes, preventing unauthorized injection from malicious sources.
    - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on keystroke processing to mitigate potential abuse or denial-of-service attempts.
    - Secure Communication Protocol: Consider using a more secure communication protocol than plain serial, if feasible for the retro system context.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - A user must build and deploy the "emulated_keyboard" hardware and firmware as described in the `README.md`.
    - An attacker must gain control of the computer connected to the Pro Micro via USB serial.
  - **Source code analysis:**
    1. **`prototype_keyboard_sender.py`**: This Python script uses `pygame` to capture keyboard events and sends them over serial. It defines the basic protocol for sending keystrokes.
    ```python
    def set_keys(self, key1, key2, shift_down, ctrl_down, break_down):
        msg = '*%c%c%c#' % (
            key1,
            key2,
            (0x80 if shift_down else 0) | (0x40 if ctrl_down else 0) | (0x20 if break_down else 0),
        )
        self.ser.write(msg)
        print(repr(self.ser.read(1)))
    ```
    The `set_keys` function formats the keystroke data into a simple string message starting with `*` and ending with `#`.  There is no input validation or security mechanism in this sender script.

    2. **`prototype_firmware/prototype_firmware.ino`**: This Arduino code receives serial data and parses it to control the CPLD via SPI.
    ```arduino
    void serialEvent() {
      while (Serial.available()) {
        char inChar = (char)Serial.read();
        if (receivingChars) {
          if (inChar == endMarker) {
            receivedChars[dataIndex] = '\0';
            receivingChars = false;
            parse_message();
          }
          else if (dataIndex < numChars) {
            receivedChars[dataIndex] = inChar;
            dataIndex++;
          }
        }
        else if (inChar == startMarker) {
          receivingChars = true;
          dataIndex = 0;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    The `serialEvent` function reads serial data until it finds an `endMarker` (`#`). It assumes that any data between `startMarker` (`*`) and `endMarker` is a valid keystroke command.

    ```arduino
    void parse_message() {
      if (receivedChars[0] == '*') {
        key1 = receivedChars[1];
        key2 = receivedChars[2];
        flags = receivedChars[3];
        update_keyboard();
      }
    }
    ```
    The `parse_message` function directly extracts `key1`, `key2`, and `flags` from the received serial data without any validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary byte values that will be directly interpreted as keystrokes by the `update_keyboard()` function and forwarded to the CPLD.

    3. **`prototype_cpld/prototype_cpld.vhd`**: This VHDL code running on the CPLD receives SPI commands from the Pro Micro and simulates keyboard signals for the BBC Master 128. The code is designed to directly translate the SPI commands into keyboard signals without any security checks.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. Build and upload the `prototype_firmware` to a Pro Micro, and program the `prototype_cpld` design to a CPLD connected as described in `emulated_keyboard/README.md`.
    2. Connect the Pro Micro to a host computer and the CPLD to a BBC Master 128.
    3. On the host computer, use a serial communication tool (e.g., `PuTTY`, `screen`, `minicom`).
    4. Open a serial connection to the Pro Micro's serial port.
    5. Send a crafted serial payload designed to execute a command on the BBC Master 128. For example, to execute `*RUN`, send the following serial data (corresponding to 'R', 'U', 'N' and ENTER keystrokes, along with necessary flags):
        * Payload (ASCII representation for clarity): `*RUN\r#`
        * Payload (Hex representation): `2A 52 55 4E 0D 23`
    6. Observe the BBC Master 128. If the vulnerability is present, the BBC Master 128 should execute the injected `*RUN` command, demonstrating arbitrary keystroke injection.  Further more complex and potentially harmful commands can be injected to confirm the full impact.
