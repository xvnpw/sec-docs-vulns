- Vulnerability Name: SendGrid API Key Exposure through Environment Variables
- Description:
  - The application uses SendGrid API to send email alerts for anomaly detection.
  - The SendGrid API key is configured as an environment variable named `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in the Cloud Function.
  - An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cloud Function's environment variables can retrieve the SendGrid API key.
  - This access can be achieved through various means, such as compromising the Google Cloud project credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the deployment pipeline, or insider threats.
  - Once the API key is obtained, the attacker can use it to send emails through the project's SendGrid account.
- Impact:
  - **Spoofed Emails:** The attacker can send emails that appear to originate from the legitimate alerting system. These spoofed emails can be used for phishing attacks, tricking recipients into divulging sensitive information or clicking malicious links.
  - **Malicious Content Distribution:** Attackers can send emails containing malicious content, misinformation, or propaganda to recipients of anomaly notifications, potentially damaging the reputation of the project and the organization.
  - **SendGrid Account Abuse:** The attacker can utilize the compromised SendGrid account for their own email sending purposes, potentially exceeding usage limits, incurring unexpected costs for the project owner, or damaging the sender reputation of the associated SendGrid account.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Using environment variables for storing the API key is a partial mitigation compared to hardcoding the key in the source code. However, environment variables in Cloud Functions are still accessible to authorized personnel and potentially vulnerable if access control is mismanaged or the cloud environment is compromised.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secret Management System:** Implement a robust secret management system like Google Cloud Secret Manager to store and manage the SendGrid API key. Secret Manager provides features like access control, audit logging, and versioning, significantly enhancing security compared to relying solely on environment variables.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict access to the Cloud Function's environment variables and the secret management system to only authorized personnel and services that absolutely require it.
  - **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of the SendGrid API key. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker if a key is compromised. Automated key rotation through Secret Manager lifecycle policies should be considered.
  - **Monitoring and Alerting for API Abuse:** Implement monitoring of SendGrid API usage for unusual patterns or suspicious activities, such as a sudden surge in email sending volume, sending emails to unusual recipients, or changes in sender email addresses. Set up alerts to notify security teams of any anomalies that could indicate a compromised API key.
- Preconditions:
  - The application must be deployed as a Cloud Function and configured to send email alerts using SendGrid.
  - The attacker needs to gain unauthorized access to the Google Cloud project and specifically to the Cloud Function's configuration or runtime environment where environment variables are accessible.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/config.example.py`
    ```python
    SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ["SENDGRID_API_KEY"]
    ```
    - This line in the example configuration file demonstrates that the application is designed to retrieve the SendGrid API key from the environment variable `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.
  - File: `/code/src/anomaly_detector.py`
    ```python
    from config import SENDGRID_API_KEY
    ...
    sg = SendGridAPIClient(SENDGRID_API_KEY)
    ...
    sg.send(message)
    ```
    - The `anomaly_detector.py` script imports the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` from the `config.py` module.
    - It then initializes the `SendGridAPIClient` using this API key.
    - Subsequently, the `sg.send(message)` function is called to send emails, utilizing the API key for authentication with the SendGrid service.
    - This code snippet confirms that the SendGrid API key, sourced from the environment variable, is directly used to authenticate and send emails, making it a critical security element. Compromise of this key directly leads to the ability to send emails on behalf of the application.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Deploy the `ad-manager-alerter` Cloud Function as per the instructions in `README.md`.
     - Configure SendGrid and obtain a valid SendGrid API key.
     - Set the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable for the deployed Cloud Function with the obtained API key.
     - Ensure you have sufficient permissions in the Google Cloud project to view Cloud Function details, including environment variables (e.g., `roles/cloudfunctions.viewer`).
  2. **Steps:**
     - Access the Google Cloud Console.
     - Navigate to Cloud Functions and select the deployed `ad-manager-alerter` function.
     - Go to the "Configuration" tab and then to "Runtime environment variables".
     - **Note:** While in a real production environment, the actual API key value might be masked or not directly visible in the console, assume an attacker with compromised project access or through other means (e.g., Cloud Functions API, misconfigured logging) has retrieved the value of the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable.
     - **Simulate API Key Compromise:**  Assume the attacker now possesses the SendGrid API key.
     - Using the compromised `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, execute the following Python script (or a similar script using `curl` or another HTTP client) from an external system (outside of the Google Cloud project):
       ```python
       import os
       from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
       from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

       COMPROMISED_SENDGRID_API_KEY = "YOUR_RETRIEVED_SENDGRID_API_KEY"  # Replace with the assumed compromised API key value
       SENDER_ADDRESS = "attacker@example.com"  # Attacker's spoofed sender address
       RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = ["victim@example.com"]  # Recipient's email address

       message = Mail(
           from_email=SENDER_ADDRESS,
           to_emails=RECIPIENT_ADDRESS,
           subject="SECURITY VULNERABILITY TEST - SPOOFED EMAIL",
           html_content="<p>This email is sent by an attacker exploiting the compromised SendGrid API key of the Ad Manager Alerter project. This is a security vulnerability test to demonstrate the impact of API key exposure.</p>"
       )
       try:
           sg = SendGridAPIClient(COMPROMISED_SENDGRID_API_KEY)
           response = sg.send(message)
           print(f"Email sent successfully. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error sending email: {e}")
       ```
     - Replace `"YOUR_RETRIEVED_SENDGRID_API_KEY"` with the actual (or assumed compromised) SendGrid API key value.
     - Replace `"attacker@example.com"` and `"victim@example.com"` with appropriate sender and recipient email addresses for testing.
     - Run the Python script.
  3. **Expected Result:**
     - The Python script should execute successfully, and the SendGrid API should send an email to the `victim@example.com` address.
     - The recipient (`victim@example.com`) should receive an email that:
       - Appears to be sent from the spoofed sender address (`attacker@example.com`).
       - Contains the subject "SECURITY VULNERABILITY TEST - SPOOFED EMAIL" and the body content defined in the script.
     - Successful email delivery confirms that an attacker, possessing the `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, can indeed send arbitrary emails through the project's SendGrid account, thus validating the SendGrid API Key Exposure vulnerability.
