- Vulnerability name: Service Account Credential Exposure and Abuse

- Description: The project relies on a Google Cloud Service Account for authentication and authorization to access various Google Cloud services, including Google Ad Manager API, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and BigQuery. The service account's credentials are used by the Cloud Function to perform actions such as downloading reports, building machine learning models, and sending alerts. If the service account's credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to these services. This compromise could occur due to various reasons, including:
    - **IAM Misconfiguration:** Overly permissive IAM roles granted to the service account, allowing access to resources beyond what is strictly necessary for the application to function.
    - **Credential Leakage (less likely in GCP managed environment, but possible if misconfigured):** If the service account key was somehow exported and stored insecurely outside of Google Cloud, or if there's a vulnerability in the metadata service allowing unauthorized access to tokens (unlikely but theoretically possible).
    - **Insider Threat:** Malicious insiders with access to the Google Cloud project could potentially exfiltrate or misuse the service account credentials.

    If compromised, the service account could be abused to:
    - **Exfiltrate Ad Manager Reports:** Download sensitive advertising data from Google Ad Manager reports stored in GCS, potentially gaining insights into business performance, advertising strategies, and customer data (depending on the report content and Ad Manager setup).
    - **Access and Manipulate BigQuery Data:** Read, modify, or delete data in the BigQuery datasets used by the project. This could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or manipulation of anomaly detection models.
    - **Disrupt Anomaly Detection and Alerting:** Modify or disable the anomaly detection system, preventing alerts from being sent and potentially masking malicious activities or performance issues.
    - **Potentially Access Other GCP Resources:** Depending on the IAM roles assigned to the service account, the attacker might be able to access other Google Cloud resources within the project, expanding the scope of the attack.

- Impact:  A compromised service account can lead to a significant data breach, disruption of services, financial loss, and reputational damage. The severity depends on the scope of access granted to the service account and the sensitivity of the data and systems it can access. In this project, the impact is considered critical due to potential access to Ad Manager reports and BigQuery datasets, which can contain sensitive business data.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - **Google-managed Service Account:** The project utilizes Google-managed service accounts, which are generally more secure than manually managed service account keys, as Google handles key rotation and storage within its infrastructure.
    - **OIDC Authentication for Workflow:** The workflow example uses OIDC authentication when calling the Cloud Function, which is a secure way to authenticate service-to-service communication within Google Cloud.
    - **Metadata Server Token Retrieval:** The `report_downloader.py` retrieves the service account access token from the metadata server, which is a secure method within the Google Cloud environment, avoiding hardcoding or storing credentials in the code.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for Service Account Roles:**  Implement the principle of least privilege by granting the service account only the minimum necessary IAM roles and permissions required for the project to function.  Specifically, review and restrict roles related to Ad Manager API, GCS, and BigQuery to the least permissive options that still allow the application to operate correctly. For example, instead of "BigQuery Data Owner," consider using roles with more granular permissions if possible.
    - **Regular Audit of Service Account Permissions:**  Establish a process for regularly auditing the IAM roles and permissions assigned to the service account to ensure they remain appropriate and are not overly permissive.
    - **Monitoring Service Account Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging of the service account's activity to detect any suspicious or unauthorized usage patterns. This could include monitoring API calls, data access patterns, and resource modifications.  Google Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring can be used for this purpose.
    - **IAM Policy Controls:** Implement IAM policy controls and constraints to further restrict what the service account can do, even within its granted roles. For example, use organizational policies to limit the regions or services the service account can access.
    - **VPC Service Controls (if applicable):** For highly sensitive deployments, consider using VPC Service Controls to create a security perimeter around the Google Cloud resources used by the project. This can help mitigate data exfiltration risks even if a service account is compromised.

- Preconditions:
    - The Google Cloud Service Account used by the Cloud Function is compromised. This could happen due to IAM misconfiguration, credential leakage (less likely in GCP), or insider threat.

- Source code analysis:
    - **Service Account Usage:** The code explicitly uses the service account in multiple modules:
        - `report_downloader.py`:  Retrieves service account access token using metadata server:
          ```python
          def get_access():
              url = (f"{METADATA_URL}instance/service-accounts/" +
                     f"{SERVICE_ACCOUNT}/token?scopes={SCOPES}")
              # ...
              r = requests.get(url, headers=METADATA_HEADERS, timeout=60)
              # ...
              return r.json()

          def get_ad_manager_client():
              oauth2_client = get_oauth2_client_access_token(get_access())
              ad_manager_client = ad_manager.AdManagerClient(oauth2_client,
                                                             APPLICATION_NAME,
                                                             network_code=NETWORK_CODE)
              return ad_manager_client
          ```
          This function obtains an access token for the service account to interact with the Ad Manager API.
        - `report_downloader.py`: Uses `google.cloud.storage.Client()` to interact with Google Cloud Storage:
          ```python
          def upload_to_gcs(filename, gcs_filename):
              client = storage.Client()
              bucket = client.get_bucket(BUCKET)
              blob = bucket.blob(gcs_filename)
              blob.upload_from_filename(filename)
          ```
        - `ml_builder.py` and `anomaly_detector.py`: Use `bigquery.Client()` to interact with BigQuery:
          ```python
          from google.cloud import bigquery
          client = bigquery.Client() # ... used in queries
          ```
    - **Implicit Service Account Context:**  When deployed as a Cloud Function within Google Cloud, the code implicitly runs under the context of the configured service account. Any operations performed using the Google Cloud client libraries (like `google-cloud-bigquery` and `google-cloud-storage`) will use the credentials of this service account.

- Security test case:
    1. **Identify Service Account:** Determine the service account associated with the deployed Cloud Function. This can be found in the Cloud Function's settings in the Google Cloud Console or using `gcloud` commands.
    2. **Review Service Account IAM Roles:** Examine the IAM roles granted to the identified service account. Check for overly permissive roles such as `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/bigquery.admin`, `roles/admanager.administrator` (or similar broad roles) that might grant excessive privileges.
    3. **Simulate Service Account Compromise (Conceptual/Permissions Check):**  Assuming you have sufficient permissions in the GCP project (or in a test environment):
        - **Attempt Unauthorized GCS Access:**  Try to use the service account's credentials (or simulate them if direct credential access is not possible - e.g., by impersonating the service account if you have necessary IAM permissions) to access and download files from the GCS bucket defined in `config.py`, even files that should be outside the scope of the anomaly detection application.
        - **Attempt Unauthorized BigQuery Access:** Similarly, try to use the service account's credentials to query, modify, or delete data in the BigQuery datasets defined in `config.py`, beyond what the anomaly detection application should be doing.
        - **Attempt Unauthorized Ad Manager API Access:** Attempt to use the service account's credentials to access Ad Manager API functionalities beyond running reports, if possible, depending on the Ad Manager permissions granted to the service account.
    4. **Verify Unauthorized Access (if successful):** If steps in #3 are successful in accessing resources beyond the intended scope, it confirms that a potential compromise of the service account could lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation.  This test case primarily focuses on *verifying permissions* and the *potential impact* of service account compromise, rather than demonstrating a direct exploit to *obtain* the service account credentials themselves (which is a broader GCP security concern).
