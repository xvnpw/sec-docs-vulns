* Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Service Account Permissions
* Description:
    1. The project's documentation instructs users to create a service account and grant it overly broad permissions. Specifically, it recommends granting the "BigQuery Data Owner" role and the "Executive" role in Google Ad Manager.
    2. The "BigQuery Data Owner" role grants extensive control over BigQuery datasets, potentially beyond what is necessary for the anomaly detection application.
    3. The "Executive" role in Ad Manager provides broad access to advertising data and settings.
    4. If a user follows these instructions and an attacker gains access to the service account's credentials (e.g., through misconfiguration or compromised infrastructure outside of this project's scope), the attacker can leverage these excessive permissions.
    5. With "BigQuery Data Owner", the attacker can access, modify, or delete any data in the specified BigQuery dataset, potentially including sensitive advertising data or other datasets if permissions are not narrowly scoped.
    6. With "Executive" role in Ad Manager, the attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive advertising reports and potentially modify Ad Manager settings depending on the exact permissions granted by the "Executive" role.
* Impact:
    * Unauthorized access to sensitive advertising data within the victim's Google Ad Manager account.
    * Potential data exfiltration of advertising performance metrics, revenue data, and potentially customer-related information depending on the reports being accessed.
    * Risk of unauthorized modification or deletion of data within the BigQuery dataset used by the application.
    * Potential for further unauthorized actions within the victim's Google Cloud project and Ad Manager account if the attacker pivots from the compromised service account.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None in the project code itself. The project relies on the user to configure service account permissions correctly.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Principle of Least Privilege Documentation:** The documentation should be updated to strongly recommend granting the service account only the minimum necessary permissions.  Instead of "BigQuery Data Owner", suggest more restrictive roles like "BigQuery Data Editor" or "BigQuery Query User" depending on the project's actual needs. For Ad Manager, the documentation should guide users to choose the least permissive role that still allows report generation, instead of broadly recommending "Executive".
    * **Clarification of Required Permissions:** The documentation should clearly list the specific permissions (not just roles) required for each component of the application (report downloading, BigQuery operations, email sending). This allows users to create custom roles with even finer-grained control.
    * **Security Best Practices Warning:** The README should include a prominent warning about the security implications of granting overly broad service account permissions and emphasize the importance of following the principle of least privilege.
* Preconditions:
    1. The user must deploy the project to Google Cloud and configure it to access their Google Ad Manager account.
    2. The user must follow the project's documentation and create a service account.
    3. The user must grant the service account the roles as suggested in the documentation ("BigQuery Data Owner" and "Executive" in Ad Manager).
    4. An attacker must gain knowledge of the service account's email address (which might be predictable or discoverable if not kept secret) and then compromise the service account credentials or gain access through other means if overly permissive roles are granted.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * **README.md:**
        * The "Setup" section under "Create service account", "Create a Google Cloud Bucket", and "Create a BigQuery dataset (used for alerting)" guides the user to grant permissions to the service account.
        * Specifically, under "Create a BigQuery dataset (used for alerting)", it states: "**Important!** Make sure you grant access for the service account to run queries on this data set. You can do this by adding them as a Principal with the role **"Big Query Data Owner"**."
        * Under "Grant access to run Ad Manager Reports", it states: "2. [Add the service account email to Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6078734?hl=en) with rights to run reports. (Eg. role "[Executive](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/177403?hl=en)")"
        * These instructions directly encourage users to grant overly permissive roles.
    * **Codebase:** The code itself does not enforce or check service account permissions. It relies on the underlying Google Cloud and Ad Manager IAM systems for access control. The vulnerability lies in the documented instructions leading to insecure configurations.
    * **config.example.py:** This file contains `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` variable which is used in `report_downloader.py` to get access token. This reinforces the service account based authentication mechanism, making the permissions granted to this service account critical for security.
    * **report_downloader.py:** The `get_access()` function retrieves an access token for the configured service account. The security of this token and the permissions associated with the service account are paramount.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        * Deploy the ad-manager-alerter project as a Google Cloud Function and Workflow in your own Google Cloud project, following the instructions in the README.md.
        * Create a service account as instructed and grant it the "BigQuery Data Owner" role on a BigQuery dataset and the "Executive" role in your test Ad Manager network.
        * Ensure the application is functioning correctly and can download reports and detect anomalies.
        * Obtain the email address of the service account you created.
    2. **Simulate Attacker Access (Manual Test - Requires GCP Project Access):**
        * As an attacker who has somehow gained access to your Google Cloud project with sufficient permissions (e.g., Project IAM Admin, or impersonation capability), but *not* the original service account's private key (to simulate external attacker who only knows the service account email and relies on overly broad permissions).
        * In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to BigQuery.
        * Impersonate the service account.  This can often be done if an attacker has sufficient broader GCP permissions to impersonate service accounts within the project.  *(In a real external attack scenario, gaining access to impersonate a service account would be a significant escalation of privilege, but for a test case within a controlled environment, this simulates the impact if such broader access were achieved.)*
        * Using the BigQuery console while impersonating the service account, attempt to:
            * Query and view all tables in the BigQuery dataset that the service account has "BigQuery Data Owner" access to.  Verify you can access sensitive advertising data.
            * Attempt to delete tables or the entire dataset. Verify that "BigQuery Data Owner" allows destructive actions beyond just reading the data used for anomaly detection.
        * In the Google Ad Manager UI, attempt to access and download reports, and explore different sections of Ad Manager to see what data and settings are accessible with the "Executive" role granted to the service account. Verify access to sensitive advertising data and configuration.
    3. **Expected Results:**
        * As the attacker impersonating the service account, you should be able to successfully query and view sensitive advertising data in BigQuery.
        * You should be able to perform destructive actions in BigQuery (if "BigQuery Data Owner" is granted).
        * You should be able to access and download Ad Manager reports, and potentially access other sensitive areas within Ad Manager, depending on the specifics of the "Executive" role.
    4. **Remediation:**
        * Update the documentation to strongly recommend and guide users to implement the principle of least privilege. Replace the recommendation of "BigQuery Data Owner" with more restrictive roles like "BigQuery Data Editor" or "BigQuery Query User" and similarly for Ad Manager roles, recommending the least permissive role necessary for report generation.
        * Provide specific lists of required permissions instead of just roles to enable users to create custom roles for even tighter security.
        * Add a security warning to the README.md emphasizing the risks of overly permissive service account configurations.
