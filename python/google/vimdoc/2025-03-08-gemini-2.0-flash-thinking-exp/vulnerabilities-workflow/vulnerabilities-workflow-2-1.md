- Vulnerability name: Path Traversal via Plugin Path

- Description:
    1. The `vimdoc` tool takes a plugin directory path as input from the command line argument `plugin`.
    2. The tool constructs the output directory for the generated help file by joining the user-provided plugin path with the subdirectory "doc".
    3. Specifically, in `__main__.py`, the output directory `docdir` is created using `os.path.join(args.plugin, 'doc')`.
    4. If a user provides a malicious plugin path that includes path traversal sequences like `../`, the `os.path.join` function will resolve this path.
    5. For example, if the user provides `plugins/myplugin/../../../` as the plugin path, the resulting `docdir` will be `plugins/myplugin/../../../doc`, which simplifies to `doc` relative to the current working directory.
    6. Subsequently, when `vimdoc` generates the help file, it will be written to this potentially manipulated `docdir`.
    7. This allows an attacker to write the generated help file to an arbitrary location outside of the intended plugin directory by crafting a malicious plugin path.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the user's system if the user runs `vimdoc` on a maliciously crafted vim plugin path.
    - This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
        - Overwriting system configuration files, potentially leading to system compromise.
        - Overwriting user data files, leading to data loss or corruption.
        - Planting malicious scripts in locations where they might be automatically executed.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `os.path.join` with the user-provided path without any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the plugin path.
    - Ensuring that the output directory is always within the intended plugin directory.
    - Using secure path manipulation functions that prevent path traversal.
    - Restricting output directory creation to only subdirectories within the plugin directory.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must run the `vimdoc` tool on a vim plugin for which the attacker has control over the directory path.
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious plugin path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

- Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/vimdoc/__main__.py**
    ```python
    import os
    import sys

    import vimdoc.args
    from vimdoc.module import Modules
    from vimdoc.output import Helpfile


    def main(argv=None):
      if argv is None:
        argv = sys.argv
      args = vimdoc.args.parser.parse_args(argv[1:])

      docdir = os.path.join(args.plugin, 'doc') # Vulnerable line
      if not os.path.isdir(docdir):
        os.mkdir(docdir)

      for module in Modules(args.plugin):
        Helpfile(module, docdir).Write()
    ```
    - The `main` function takes user input `args.plugin` directly from command line arguments.
    - `os.path.join(args.plugin, 'doc')` constructs the `docdir` without validating `args.plugin`.
    - If `args.plugin` contains `../`, `os.path.join` will resolve the path, leading to potential path traversal.

    2. **File: /code/vimdoc/args.py**
    ```python
    import argparse
    import os

    import vimdoc

    try:
      import shtab
    except ImportError:
      from . import _shtab as shtab


    def Source(path):
      if not os.path.isdir(path):
        raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError('{} not found'.format(path))
      if not os.access(path, os.R_OK):
        raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError('Cannot access {}'.format(path))
      return path


    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        'vimdoc',
        formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter,
        description='''\
    Generate vim helpfiles

    Basic usage:
      %(prog)s vim-someplugin/
      (or %(prog)s .)''')
    shtab.add_argument_to(parser)
    parser.add_argument(
        'plugin', type=Source, metavar='PLUGIN',
        help='a vim plugin directory').complete = shtab.DIR
    parser.add_argument('--version', action='version',
        version='%(prog)s ' + vimdoc.__version__)
    ```
    - The `Source` function only checks if the path is a directory and is readable, but does not perform any sanitization to prevent path traversal.
    - The `plugin` argument in `argparse` uses the `Source` type, which means the raw user input is passed to `os.path.join` in `__main__.py` after basic checks.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a directory named `malicious_plugin`.
    2. Inside `malicious_plugin`, create an empty file named `plugin.vim`.
    3. Navigate to a temporary directory in your terminal.
    4. Run the `vimdoc` tool with the following command, assuming `vimdoc` script is in your PATH or you are running it from the project root:
       ```bash
       vimdoc malicious_plugin/../../../tmp/
       ```
       (Here, `malicious_plugin/../../../tmp/` is the crafted malicious plugin path aiming to write the help file to `/tmp/doc/malicious_plugin.txt`)
    5. Check if a directory named `doc` and a file named `malicious_plugin.txt` are created inside the `/tmp/` directory.
    6. If the file `/tmp/doc/malicious_plugin.txt` is created, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the help file was written outside the expected `malicious_plugin` directory and into the `/tmp/doc` directory.
