- Vulnerability name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Query
- Description: A malicious user could craft a search query containing Javascript code. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs before displaying search results, this Javascript code could be executed in the browser of other users viewing the search results. This could happen if the search query is reflected in the DOM without proper encoding, or if the search results themselves contain unsanitized data that is rendered in a way that allows Javascript execution.
- Impact: Successful XSS could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the web page.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None apparent from the provided files. The files are mostly configuration and setup, and do not include client-side code where input sanitization or output encoding would be implemented.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization of search queries on the client-side before sending to the server.
  - Output encoding of search results and any user-controlled data displayed on the page to prevent Javascript execution.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and protect against XSS.
- Preconditions: An attacker needs to be able to submit a search query to the application.
- Source code analysis: No new source code was provided in this batch that is relevant to client-side rendering or search query handling. The provided files are related to gRPC transport for server-side API functionalities (ResultStoreUpload and ResultStoreFileDownload), and do not expose client-side code where XSS vulnerabilities related to search queries would typically be found. Therefore, no further source code analysis can be performed based on these files to confirm or deny this vulnerability.
- Security test case:
  1. Access the Resultstore Search web application.
  2. In the search bar, enter a payload designed to trigger Javascript execution, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
  3. Click the "Search" button.
  4. Observe if an alert box appears when the search results are displayed. If an alert box appears, it indicates that the Javascript code from the search query was executed, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
