- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Bar
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Javascript payload.
    2. The attacker injects this payload into the search bar input field.
    3. A user performs a search, including the malicious payload.
    4. The application processes the search query and displays results.
    5. If the application fails to properly sanitize the search query before rendering it in the user interface, the malicious Javascript payload is executed within the user's browser.
- Impact:
    - Session hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Data theft: Sensitive data displayed on the search results page or accessible within the application context can be exfiltrated.
    - Account takeover: In some scenarios, attackers might be able to perform actions on behalf of the user or completely take over their account.
    - Defacement: The attacker could alter the visual appearance of the web page.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the provided files, there is no client-side code to analyze, so it's impossible to determine if any input sanitization or output encoding is implemented within the search functionality.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization on the client-side to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious Javascript code before sending the search query to the server.
    - Output encoding: Implement context-aware output encoding on the client-side when rendering search results to prevent Javascript code from being executed in the browser. Use appropriate encoding functions based on the rendering context (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, Javascript encoding for Javascript strings).
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be vulnerable to XSS, meaning it doesn't properly sanitize user input in the search bar before displaying search results.
    - An attacker needs to be able to access the search bar input field to inject malicious code.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code for client-side components, specifically the search bar functionality and result rendering, is not provided in PROJECT FILES. The provided files are related to gRPC transport layer in Python and do not contain any information about client-side implementation or vulnerability mitigation. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability and confirm its existence is not possible at this time based on these files.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Access the Resultstore Search web application in a browser.
    2. In the search bar, enter the following payload: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    3. Click the "Search" button.
    4. Observe the behavior of the application.
    5. Expected behavior (Vulnerability Absent):
        - The search query is executed, and the results page is displayed without any Javascript alert box appearing. The search term might be displayed literally in the results page, or properly encoded.
    6. Vulnerable Behavior (Vulnerability Present):
        - An alert box with the text "XSS" is displayed in the browser, indicating that the Javascript code from the payload was executed. This confirms the presence of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
