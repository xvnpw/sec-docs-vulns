- Vulnerability name: Command Injection via Configuration File Parsing
- Description:
    - The `weather-dl` tool is designed to download weather data based on configurations provided in `.cfg` or `.json` files.
    - An attacker could create a malicious configuration file.
    - This malicious file would contain specially crafted input within configuration parameters (e.g., `target_path`, `dataset` or any other processed parameter).
    - If `weather-dl`'s configuration parser does not properly sanitize or validate these inputs, it could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    - When a user, such as a climate or weather researcher, unknowingly uses `weather-dl` with this malicious configuration file, the injected commands would be executed by the system.
- Impact:
    - **Critical Impact:** Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution.
        - **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the user's local system or cloud environment.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data, including weather data, API keys, or personal files, could be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled locations.
        - **System Compromise:** The attacker could fully compromise the user's environment, potentially installing malware, creating backdoors, or using the compromised system as a staging point for further attacks.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers might modify or delete weather data or other critical files.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - No specific mitigations are mentioned in the provided project files to prevent command injection during configuration file parsing. The documentation emphasizes reviewing configuration files but does not mention any automated security measures in the tool itself.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input validation for all configuration parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious commands. Sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences before processing them.
    - **Secure Parsing Libraries:** Utilize secure parsing libraries that are designed to prevent common injection vulnerabilities. Avoid using unsafe functions like `eval()` or `os.system()` directly on configuration parameters.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the `weather-dl` tool and any processes it spawns operate with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful command injection.
    - **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Consider running `weather-dl` within a sandboxed or containerized environment to restrict its access to system resources and limit the impact of potential exploits.
- Preconditions:
    - **User Trust and Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to convince a user to download and use a malicious configuration file. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by hosting the malicious file on a seemingly legitimate website.
    - **Execution of `weather-dl` with Malicious Configuration:** The user must execute the `weather-dl` command and explicitly specify the attacker's crafted configuration file as input.
- Source code analysis:
    - **Configuration File Handling:** The `weather-dl` tool uses configuration files (as mentioned in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/Configuration.md`, `weather_dl/README.md`).
    - **File Parsing Logic:** The `PROJECT FILES` include `weather_dl/download_pipeline/parsers.py` and `weather_dl/download_pipeline/config.py`, suggesting that parsing logic is implemented within the project.
    - **Absence of Security Measures:**  Review of the provided files (READMEs, documentation) does not reveal any explicit security measures implemented to prevent command injection during configuration parsing. There's no mention of input sanitization, validation, or secure parsing practices.
    - **Vulnerable Code Points (Hypothetical):** Without access to the actual Python code that parses the configuration files, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact vulnerable code points. However, potential areas of concern within `weather_dl/download_pipeline/parsers.py` could include:
        - Functions that process string values from the configuration files, especially if these values are used to construct system commands or interact with the operating system.
        - Use of Python's `eval()` or `exec()` functions, which are notoriously unsafe for processing untrusted input.
        - Insufficient escaping or quoting of configuration parameters when they are passed to shell commands.
    - **Visualization (Conceptual):**

    ```
    User -> weather-dl (reads malicious config file) --> Insecure Parser --> System Command Execution (malicious commands injected from config) --> Attacker Actions (data breach, system compromise etc.)
    ```

- Security test case:
    - **Objective:** Verify if `weather-dl` is vulnerable to command injection through malicious configuration files.
    - **Precondition:** Attacker has created a malicious configuration file (e.g., `malicious.cfg`) designed to inject a command. Assumes the attacker can deliver this file to the victim (e.g., via website, email etc.).
    - **Steps:**
        1. **Craft a Malicious Configuration File (`malicious.cfg`):** Create a configuration file that includes a parameter likely to be processed as part of a system command. For example, if `target_path` is used in shell commands, inject a command within it. A sample malicious `malicious.cfg` could look like this (assuming `target_path` is vulnerable):

        ```cfg
        [parameters]
        client=cds
        dataset=reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels
        target_path=malicious_$(touch /tmp/pwned).nc
        partition_keys=year
        [selection]
        year=2024
        ```

        This `target_path` is designed to execute `touch /tmp/pwned` command when processed, creating a file `/tmp/pwned` as proof of concept.

        2. **Prepare Test Environment:** Set up a controlled environment where you can run `weather-tools`. This could be a virtual machine or a container to isolate potential damage. Install `weather-tools` as described in the `README.md`.

        3. **Execute `weather-dl` with the Malicious Configuration:** Run the `weather-dl` tool, providing the malicious configuration file as an argument and using `--local-run` for safety and easier observation.

        ```bash
        weather-dl malicious.cfg --local-run
        ```

        4. **Check for Command Execution:** After running the command, check if the injected command was executed. In this example, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created:

        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```

        If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful.

    - **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created, indicating successful command injection. If the vulnerability is mitigated, the command should not be executed, and the file `/tmp/pwned` will not be present.
