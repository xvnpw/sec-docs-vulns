## Vulnerabilities Found

### Vulnerability Name: Malicious Colab Notebook Execution

**Description:**
1. An attacker identifies that the project uses Colab notebooks as the primary way for users to interact with the library and learn how to use it.
2. The attacker creates a modified version of one of the provided Colab notebooks (e.g., `design_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb` or `post_analysis_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb`).
3. The attacker injects malicious Python code into the modified Colab notebook. This code could perform various actions, such as stealing user data, accessing Google Drive files, or compromising the user's Google Colab environment.
4. The attacker hosts this malicious notebook on a public platform, potentially using a deceptive link or a socially engineered scenario to distribute it.
5. The attacker uses social engineering tactics to trick a user into opening and executing the malicious Colab notebook. This could involve:
    - Creating a website or social media post that appears to be a legitimate tutorial or guide for the `matched_markets` library, but links to the malicious notebook instead of the official one.
    - Sending emails or messages to users interested in geo experiments or statistical analysis, enticing them to use the "improved" or "enhanced" notebook.
    - Compromising a platform where users might search for resources related to geo experiments and replacing legitimate links with links to the malicious notebook.
6. The unsuspecting user, believing they are accessing a legitimate resource, opens the malicious notebook in their Google Colab environment and executes the cells, including the injected malicious code.
7. The malicious code executes within the user's Google Colab environment, leveraging the permissions and access granted to the user's Colab session.

**Impact:**
- Arbitrary Python code execution within the user's Google Colab environment.
- Potential compromise of the user's Google account and data, including access to Google Drive, emails, and other services accessible from the Colab environment.
- Data theft from the user's Colab environment.
- Installation of malware or backdoors within the user's Colab environment or potentially their local system if Colab interacts with it.
- Credential harvesting if the malicious code attempts to steal API keys or other sensitive information stored in the Colab environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Disclaimer in `README.md`: "This is not an officially supported Google product. For research purposes only." - This disclaimer weakly mitigates liability but does little to prevent users from falling victim to social engineering attacks. It does not actively warn users about the risks of executing notebooks from untrusted sources.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Code signing or verification of the Colab notebooks to ensure their integrity and origin.
- Displaying security warnings within the Colab notebooks themselves, cautioning users about the risks of executing code from untrusted sources, even within seemingly legitimate notebooks.
- Prominent security warnings in the `README.md` and any documentation, explicitly advising users to only download and execute notebooks from the official repository and to verify notebook integrity.
- Providing clear instructions or guidance on how users can verify the integrity of the Colab notebooks they are using, such as checksums or digital signatures if implemented.

**Preconditions:**
- The user must have access to Google Colab and be willing to execute Colab notebooks.
- The user must be socially engineered into downloading or accessing a malicious Colab notebook, believing it to be a legitimate resource for the `matched_markets` library.
- The user must execute the cells within the malicious Colab notebook in their Google Colab environment.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- The vulnerability is not directly within the Python code of the `matched_markets` library itself. The library code appears to be focused on statistical analysis and does not inherently introduce code execution vulnerabilities.
- The attack vector is introduced by the project's distribution and usage model, which heavily relies on Colab notebooks as the primary means of interaction.
- The `README.md` file, while providing useful information, inadvertently becomes part of the attack vector by directing users to Colab notebooks without sufficient security warnings or integrity verification mechanisms. The links provided in `README.md` are currently safe, but an attacker could distribute a modified README with links to malicious notebooks.
- The lack of any code signing or integrity checks for the notebooks allows attackers to easily distribute modified versions that are indistinguishable from legitimate ones to the average user.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Malicious Notebook:** Create a copy of a legitimate Colab notebook from the repository (e.g., `design_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb`). Modify this notebook by adding a new code cell at the beginning that contains malicious Python code. This code could be designed to:
    - Display a prominent warning message to the user indicating that this notebook might be malicious (for ethical testing and demonstration purposes).
    - As a proof of concept of malicious activity, attempt to access and list files in the user's Google Drive root directory. This action requires the appropriate Google Colab permissions, which the user grants when executing the notebook.
    - Optionally, include code to exfiltrate a harmless piece of data (e.g., Colab environment details) to an attacker-controlled server as further proof of concept, but ensure this is done ethically and with minimal risk.
2. **Host Malicious Notebook:** Host the modified Colab notebook on a publicly accessible platform. This could be:
    - A separate, attacker-controlled GitHub repository.
    - A personal website or blog.
    - A file-sharing service.
3. **Social Engineering Attack:** Devise a social engineering scenario to lure a user into using the malicious notebook. Examples include:
    - Create a fake tutorial video or blog post demonstrating the "benefits" of using the `matched_markets` library, subtly directing users to the malicious notebook link instead of the official repository.
    - Post in online forums or communities frequented by data scientists or statisticians, recommending the "improved" notebook for geo experiment design, again linking to the malicious version.
    - Send targeted emails to researchers or analysts who might be interested in geo experiments, offering the "easier-to-use" notebook.
4. **User Execution:**  Assume the role of a targeted user and, following the social engineering lure, access and open the malicious Colab notebook in a Google Colab environment.
5. **Verify Vulnerability:** Execute the cells in the malicious notebook sequentially.
    - Observe if the warning message (if implemented) is displayed, indicating the injected malicious code is running.
    - Check if the code successfully lists files in the Google Drive root directory, confirming the ability to access user data.
    - If exfiltration code was included, verify if data was successfully sent to the attacker-controlled server (check server logs).
6. **Document and Report:** Document the steps taken, the social engineering scenario used, and the successful execution of malicious code within the Colab environment. This constitutes proof of the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Geo Index Validation in TBRMMData

**Description:**
1. An attacker can craft a `TBRMMData` object with a valid DataFrame and response column.
2. The attacker then attempts to set the `geo_index` property of the `TBRMMData` object with a list of indices.
3. The `geo_index` setter performs a check to ensure that the provided geo IDs are within the `assignable` geos.
4. However, the setter does not validate if the provided indices are valid *integer indices* for the internal geo indexing, or if they are out of bounds for the expected index range.
5. If the attacker provides a list of integers that are out of the expected range for geo indices (e.g., larger than the number of geos considered), the code may not raise an error during index assignment.
6. Subsequently, when methods like `aggregate_time_series` or `aggregate_geo_share` are called with these invalid indices, it can lead to `IndexError` or incorrect data aggregation due to out-of-bounds access in the internal `_array`. This can cause unexpected behavior or incorrect analysis results.

**Impact:**
- Providing crafted, out-of-bound geo indices can lead to incorrect data processing and potentially flawed statistical analysis.
- This could result in misleading experimental design recommendations and incorrect business decisions based on flawed analysis.
- In certain scenarios, it might lead to runtime errors (e.g., `IndexError`), disrupting the intended workflow of the library.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The `geo_index` setter in `TBRMMData` checks if the provided geo IDs are within the `assignable` set, which is a partial mitigation against completely invalid geo inputs.
- Source code analysis in `TBRMMData.geo_index.setter` at `/code/matched_markets/methodology/tbrmmdata.py`:
  ```python
  missing_geos = set(geos) - self.assignable
  if missing_geos:
    missing_geos = sorted(list(missing_geos))
    raise ValueError('Unassignable geo(s): ' + ', '.join(missing_geos))
  ```
  This check prevents the use of geo IDs that are not in the `assignable` set.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Missing validation to ensure that the provided `geo_index` values are valid *indices* within the expected range (0 to number of geos - 1).
- No explicit checks within methods like `aggregate_time_series` or `aggregate_geo_share` to validate the input `geo_indices` against the valid index range.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `TBRMMData` object, specifically when setting the `geo_index` property.
- This assumes the attacker can control or manipulate the data or parameters fed into the library, which could be possible in scenarios where user-provided data is used for geo experiment design.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- File: `/code/matched_markets/methodology/tbrmmdata.py`
- Class: `TBRMMData`
- Method: `geo_index.setter`
  ```python
  @geo_index.setter
  def geo_index(self, geos: OrderedGeos):
      """Fix the set of geos that will be used.
      ...
      """
      missing_geos = set(geos) - self.assignable
      if missing_geos:
        missing_geos = sorted(list(missing_geos))
        raise ValueError('Unassignable geo(s): ' + ', '.join(missing_geos))

      self.geo_assignments = self.geo_eligibility.get_eligible_assignments(
          geos,
          indices=True)

      self._geo_index = geos
      self._array = self.df.loc[geos].to_numpy()
      self._array_geo_share = np.array(self.geo_share[geos])
  ```
- The setter validates if provided `geos` are within `self.assignable`.
- It does not validate if the *indices* (0, 1, 2, ...) used in methods like `aggregate_time_series` are valid against the assigned `geo_index`.
- In methods like `aggregate_time_series`:
  ```python
  def aggregate_time_series(self, geo_indices: GeoIndexSet) -> Vector:
      """Return the aggregate the time series over a set of chosen geos.
      ...
      """
      return self._array[list(geo_indices)].sum(axis=0)
  ```
- If `geo_indices` contains out-of-bound indices based on the length of `self._array`, it will cause an `IndexError` or potentially incorrect summation if the indices wrap around (though numpy indexing usually raises errors for out of bound access rather than wrapping).

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a sample Pandas DataFrame and `TBRMMData` object.
2. Set a valid `geo_index` with a small number of geos, e.g., `['0', '1', '2']`.
3. Attempt to call `aggregate_time_series` with a crafted `geo_indices` set containing an out-of-bound index, e.g., `{0, 5}` where index `5` is out of bounds for `geo_index` of length 3.
4. Verify if the code raises an `IndexError` or produces incorrect aggregated results due to the out-of-bound index.
5. Expected result: The code should ideally raise a `ValueError` during `geo_index` assignment if invalid indices are directly provided, or raise an `IndexError` when accessing `_array` with invalid indices in `aggregate_time_series`, indicating a vulnerability due to lack of index validation.

### Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Input Data in TBRMMData leading to potential Pandas DataFrame errors

**Description:**
1. An attacker can craft a malicious CSV or Pandas DataFrame intended as input to the `TBRMMData` class.
2. This malicious data can contain unexpected data types in 'geo', 'date' or response columns, such as non-string 'geo' identifiers, dates in incorrect formats, or non-numeric response values.
3. When `TBRMMData` processes this data, specifically in the `__init__` method during operations like `pivot_table`, `mean(axis=1)`, or `sort_values()`, it may trigger exceptions within the Pandas library due to unexpected data types.
4. While these exceptions might not directly lead to remote code execution or data breaches, they can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect or unreliable results, effectively undermining the integrity of the experiment design and analysis. This can be exploited to generate misleading results about advertising effectiveness.

**Impact:**
- The application may crash or produce incorrect results.
- An attacker can manipulate the experiment analysis to generate misleading conclusions about advertising effectiveness by providing maliciously crafted input data.
- The reliability of the geo experiment design and analysis is compromised.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None. The code attempts to convert the 'geo' column to string (`df.geo = df.geo.astype('str')`), but there's no comprehensive validation for data types or formats of other critical columns like 'date' and response columns before using Pandas operations.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Data Validation:** Implement robust input validation in the `TBRMMData` class, specifically within the `__init__` method. This should include:
    - **Data Type Checks:** Verify that 'geo' column is consistently string type, 'date' column is in valid datetime format, and response column is numeric.
    - **Format Validation:** For 'date' column, enforce a specific date format. For response column, ensure it contains only numeric values within expected ranges if applicable.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for data conversion and Pandas operations. Instead of letting exceptions propagate, catch them and return informative error messages to the user, or gracefully handle invalid data by skipping or sanitizing it (if appropriate for the analysis context).

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input data to the `TBRMMData` class. In the context of the described attack vector, this means manipulating or crafting input data files (like CSVs) or directly providing malicious DataFrames if the library is used programmatically.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- File: `/code/matched_markets/methodology/tbrmmdata.py`
- Function: `__init__`
  ```python
  def __init__(
      self,
      df: pd.DataFrame,
      response_column: str,
      geo_eligibility: Optional[GeoEligibility] = None):
      """Initialize and validate a TBRMMData object.
      ...
      """
      df = df.copy()

      required_columns = {'date', 'geo', response_column}
      missing_columns = required_columns - set(df.columns)
      if missing_columns:
        raise ValueError('Missing column(s): ' + ', '.join(missing_columns))

      # Ensure that the geo column is a string.
      df.geo = df.geo.astype('str') # Line 39

      # Transform into a canonical format with geos in rows, dates in columns,
      # geos (rows) sorted with those with the largest volume first so that
      # the largest geos are iterated first (those with the smallest row index).
      df = df.pivot_table(values=response_column, index='geo', columns='date', # Line 45
                          fill_value=0)

      # Calculate the average 'market share' based on all data.
      geo_means = df.mean(axis=1).sort_values(ascending=False) # Line 49
      geo_share = geo_means / sum(geo_means)
      geos_in_data = set(geo_means.index)

      # For convenience sort the geos (rows) in descending order.
      self.df = df.loc[list(geo_means.index)] # Line 55
      self.geo_share = geo_share
      self.geos_in_data = geos_in_data
      ...
  ```
- **Analysis:**
    - Line 39: The code attempts to cast the 'geo' column to string, which is a basic form of sanitization.
    - Lines 45, 49, 55: These lines use Pandas DataFrame operations (`pivot_table`, `mean`, `sort_values`, `loc`) which are potentially vulnerable to errors if the input DataFrame `df` contains unexpected data types or formats in 'date' or `response_column`. For instance, if `response_column` contains non-numeric data, `mean(axis=1)` will raise an error. If 'date' column has inconsistent formats, `pivot_table` might fail or produce unexpected results.
    - There are checks for missing columns, but no checks for data types or format validity of the data within these columns beyond the attempted string conversion of 'geo'.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Assume a publicly accessible instance of the project where a user can upload a CSV file for experiment design. For a programmatic test, create a test script that directly instantiates `TBRMMData` with a malicious DataFrame.
2. **Craft Malicious CSV:** Create a CSV file named `malicious_data.csv` with the following content:
  ```csv
  date,geo,sales
  2020-03-01,geo1,100
  2020-03-02,geo1,200
  2020-03-01,geo2,invalid_sales_value
  2020-03-02,geo2,400
  invalid_date,geo3,500
  2020-03-02,geo3,600
  ```
  This CSV contains:
    - A non-numeric value `invalid_sales_value` in the 'sales' column.
    - An invalid date format `invalid_date` in the 'date' column.
3. **Attempt to Load Malicious Data:** In the publicly accessible instance (or test script):
    - Upload `malicious_data.csv` as input data for experiment design.
    - Or, in a test script, read the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame and try to instantiate `TBRMMData`:
      ```python
      import pandas as pd
      from matched_markets.methodology.tbrmmdata import TBRMMData

      malicious_df = pd.read_csv("malicious_data.csv")
      try:
          data = TBRMMData(malicious_df, response_column='sales')
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Vulnerability Triggered: {e}")
          assert isinstance(e, ValueError) or isinstance(e, TypeError) or isinstance(e, KeyError), "Expected Pandas related exception"
          return # Test Pass
      assert False, "Vulnerability not triggered, no exception raised"
      ```
4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
    - **Expected Outcome:** The application should either crash, display an error message indicating data format issues, or produce incorrect results due to the invalid data. The security test case in the code should catch a Pandas related exception.
    - **Success Condition:** If the application crashes or raises a Pandas-related exception (like ValueError, TypeError, or KeyError) during the data loading or processing phase in `TBRMMData.__init__`, the vulnerability is confirmed. If the test script catches a Pandas related exception, the test passes. If the code processes the data without error and continues, the vulnerability is not directly exploitable in this way, but further analysis might be needed to check for logical errors or incorrect results.
