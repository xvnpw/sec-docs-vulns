- vulnerability name: Malicious Colab Notebook Execution
- description:
    1. An attacker identifies that the project uses Colab notebooks as the primary way for users to interact with the library and learn how to use it.
    2. The attacker creates a modified version of one of the provided Colab notebooks (e.g., `design_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb` or `post_analysis_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb`).
    3. The attacker injects malicious Python code into the modified Colab notebook. This code could perform various actions, such as stealing user data, accessing Google Drive files, or compromising the user's Google Colab environment.
    4. The attacker hosts this malicious notebook on a public platform, potentially using a deceptive link or a socially engineered scenario to distribute it.
    5. The attacker uses social engineering tactics to trick a user into opening and executing the malicious Colab notebook. This could involve:
        - Creating a website or social media post that appears to be a legitimate tutorial or guide for the `matched_markets` library, but links to the malicious notebook instead of the official one.
        - Sending emails or messages to users interested in geo experiments or statistical analysis, enticing them to use the "improved" or "enhanced" notebook.
        - Compromising a platform where users might search for resources related to geo experiments and replacing legitimate links with links to the malicious notebook.
    6. The unsuspecting user, believing they are accessing a legitimate resource, opens the malicious notebook in their Google Colab environment and executes the cells, including the injected malicious code.
    7. The malicious code executes within the user's Google Colab environment, leveraging the permissions and access granted to the user's Colab session.
- impact:
    - Arbitrary Python code execution within the user's Google Colab environment.
    - Potential compromise of the user's Google account and data, including access to Google Drive, emails, and other services accessible from the Colab environment.
    - Data theft from the user's Colab environment.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors within the user's Colab environment or potentially their local system if Colab interacts with it.
    - Credential harvesting if the malicious code attempts to steal API keys or other sensitive information stored in the Colab environment.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations:
    - Disclaimer in `README.md`: "This is not an officially supported Google product. For research purposes only." - This disclaimer weakly mitigates liability but does little to prevent users from falling victim to social engineering attacks. It does not actively warn users about the risks of executing notebooks from untrusted sources.
- missing mitigations:
    - Code signing or verification of the Colab notebooks to ensure their integrity and origin.
    - Displaying security warnings within the Colab notebooks themselves, cautioning users about the risks of executing code from untrusted sources, even within seemingly legitimate notebooks.
    - Prominent security warnings in the `README.md` and any documentation, explicitly advising users to only download and execute notebooks from the official repository and to verify notebook integrity.
    - Providing clear instructions or guidance on how users can verify the integrity of the Colab notebooks they are using, such as checksums or digital signatures if implemented.
- preconditions:
    - The user must have access to Google Colab and be willing to execute Colab notebooks.
    - The user must be socially engineered into downloading or accessing a malicious Colab notebook, believing it to be a legitimate resource for the `matched_markets` library.
    - The user must execute the cells within the malicious Colab notebook in their Google Colab environment.
- source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the Python code of the `matched_markets` library itself. The library code appears to be focused on statistical analysis and does not inherently introduce code execution vulnerabilities.
    - The attack vector is introduced by the project's distribution and usage model, which heavily relies on Colab notebooks as the primary means of interaction.
    - The `README.md` file, while providing useful information, inadvertently becomes part of the attack vector by directing users to Colab notebooks without sufficient security warnings or integrity verification mechanisms. The links provided in `README.md` are currently safe, but an attacker could distribute a modified README with links to malicious notebooks.
    - The lack of any code signing or integrity checks for the notebooks allows attackers to easily distribute modified versions that are indistinguishable from legitimate ones to the average user.
- security test case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Notebook:** Create a copy of a legitimate Colab notebook from the repository (e.g., `design_colab_for_tbrmm.ipynb`). Modify this notebook by adding a new code cell at the beginning that contains malicious Python code. This code could be designed to:
        - Display a prominent warning message to the user indicating that this notebook might be malicious (for ethical testing and demonstration purposes).
        - As a proof of concept of malicious activity, attempt to access and list files in the user's Google Drive root directory. This action requires the appropriate Google Colab permissions, which the user grants when executing the notebook.
        - Optionally, include code to exfiltrate a harmless piece of data (e.g., Colab environment details) to an attacker-controlled server as further proof of concept, but ensure this is done ethically and with minimal risk.
    2. **Host Malicious Notebook:** Host the modified Colab notebook on a publicly accessible platform. This could be:
        - A separate, attacker-controlled GitHub repository.
        - A personal website or blog.
        - A file-sharing service.
    3. **Social Engineering Attack:** Devise a social engineering scenario to lure a user into using the malicious notebook. Examples include:
        - Create a fake tutorial video or blog post demonstrating the "benefits" of using the `matched_markets` library, subtly directing users to the malicious notebook link instead of the official repository.
        - Post in online forums or communities frequented by data scientists or statisticians, recommending the "improved" notebook for geo experiment design, again linking to the malicious version.
        - Send targeted emails to researchers or analysts who might be interested in geo experiments, offering the "easier-to-use" notebook.
    4. **User Execution:**  Assume the role of a targeted user and, following the social engineering lure, access and open the malicious Colab notebook in a Google Colab environment.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability:** Execute the cells in the malicious notebook sequentially.
        - Observe if the warning message (if implemented) is displayed, indicating the injected malicious code is running.
        - Check if the code successfully lists files in the Google Drive root directory, confirming the ability to access user data.
        - If exfiltration code was included, verify if data was successfully sent to the attacker-controlled server (check server logs).
    6. **Document and Report:** Document the steps taken, the social engineering scenario used, and the successful execution of malicious code within the Colab environment. This constitutes proof of the vulnerability.
