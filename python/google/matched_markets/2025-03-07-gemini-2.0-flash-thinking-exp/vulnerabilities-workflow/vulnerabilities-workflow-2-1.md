### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Geo Index Validation in TBRMMData

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a `TBRMMData` object with a valid DataFrame and response column.
    2. The attacker then attempts to set the `geo_index` property of the `TBRMMData` object with a list of indices.
    3. The `geo_index` setter performs a check to ensure that the provided geo IDs are within the `assignable` geos.
    4. However, the setter does not validate if the provided indices are valid *integer indices* for the internal geo indexing, or if they are out of bounds for the expected index range.
    5. If the attacker provides a list of integers that are out of the expected range for geo indices (e.g., larger than the number of geos considered), the code may not raise an error during index assignment.
    6. Subsequently, when methods like `aggregate_time_series` or `aggregate_geo_share` are called with these invalid indices, it can lead to `IndexError` or incorrect data aggregation due to out-of-bounds access in the internal `_array`. This can cause unexpected behavior or incorrect analysis results.

* Impact:
    - Providing crafted, out-of-bound geo indices can lead to incorrect data processing and potentially flawed statistical analysis.
    - This could result in misleading experimental design recommendations and incorrect business decisions based on flawed analysis.
    - In certain scenarios, it might lead to runtime errors (e.g., `IndexError`), disrupting the intended workflow of the library.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `geo_index` setter in `TBRMMData` checks if the provided geo IDs are within the `assignable` set, which is a partial mitigation against completely invalid geo inputs.
    - Source code analysis in `TBRMMData.geo_index.setter` at `/code/matched_markets/methodology/tbrmmdata.py`:
      ```python
      missing_geos = set(geos) - self.assignable
      if missing_geos:
        missing_geos = sorted(list(missing_geos))
        raise ValueError('Unassignable geo(s): ' + ', '.join(missing_geos))
      ```
      This check prevents the use of geo IDs that are not in the `assignable` set.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Missing validation to ensure that the provided `geo_index` values are valid *indices* within the expected range (0 to number of geos - 1).
    - No explicit checks within methods like `aggregate_time_series` or `aggregate_geo_share` to validate the input `geo_indices` against the valid index range.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `TBRMMData` object, specifically when setting the `geo_index` property.
    - This assumes the attacker can control or manipulate the data or parameters fed into the library, which could be possible in scenarios where user-provided data is used for geo experiment design.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/matched_markets/methodology/tbrmmdata.py`
    - Class: `TBRMMData`
    - Method: `geo_index.setter`
    ```python
    @geo_index.setter
    def geo_index(self, geos: OrderedGeos):
        """Fix the set of geos that will be used.
        ...
        """
        missing_geos = set(geos) - self.assignable
        if missing_geos:
          missing_geos = sorted(list(missing_geos))
          raise ValueError('Unassignable geo(s): ' + ', '.join(missing_geos))

        self.geo_assignments = self.geo_eligibility.get_eligible_assignments(
            geos,
            indices=True)

        self._geo_index = geos
        self._array = self.df.loc[geos].to_numpy()
        self._array_geo_share = np.array(self.geo_share[geos])
    ```
    - The setter validates if provided `geos` are within `self.assignable`.
    - It does not validate if the *indices* (0, 1, 2, ...) used in methods like `aggregate_time_series` are valid against the assigned `geo_index`.
    - In methods like `aggregate_time_series`:
    ```python
    def aggregate_time_series(self, geo_indices: GeoIndexSet) -> Vector:
        """Return the aggregate the time series over a set of chosen geos.
        ...
        """
        return self._array[list(geo_indices)].sum(axis=0)
    ```
    - If `geo_indices` contains out-of-bound indices based on the length of `self._array`, it will cause an `IndexError` or potentially incorrect summation if the indices wrap around (though numpy indexing usually raises errors for out of bound access rather than wrapping).

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a sample Pandas DataFrame and `TBRMMData` object.
    2. Set a valid `geo_index` with a small number of geos, e.g., `['0', '1', '2']`.
    3. Attempt to call `aggregate_time_series` with a crafted `geo_indices` set containing an out-of-bound index, e.g., `{0, 5}` where index `5` is out of bounds for `geo_index` of length 3.
    4. Verify if the code raises an `IndexError` or produces incorrect aggregated results due to the out-of-bound index.
    5. Expected result: The code should ideally raise a `ValueError` during `geo_index` assignment if invalid indices are directly provided, or raise an `IndexError` when accessing `_array` with invalid indices in `aggregate_time_series`, indicating a vulnerability due to lack of index validation.
