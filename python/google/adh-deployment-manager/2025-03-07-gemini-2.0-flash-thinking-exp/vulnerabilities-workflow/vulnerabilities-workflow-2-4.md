### Vulnerability 1: Hardcoded Developer Key in Sample Configuration

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded Developer Key
*   **Description:** The sample configuration file (`/code/tests/sample_config.yml`) contains a hardcoded developer key (`developer_key: A`). If a user were to use this sample configuration directly or if it were inadvertently exposed (e.g., committed to a public repository), the hardcoded developer key could be compromised. An attacker could potentially use this key to access the Ads Data Hub API, although the permissions associated with this key would depend on how it was set up in the Ads Data Hub project.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of a developer key, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Ads Data Hub API. The severity of the impact depends on the permissions granted to the compromised developer key within the Ads Data Hub project.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Remove the hardcoded developer key from the sample configuration file.
    *   Add a comment in the sample configuration file explicitly warning users not to use it directly in production and to replace the placeholder with their actual developer key, preferably sourced from a secure environment variable or secret management system.
    *   In the documentation, strongly advise against hardcoding developer keys in configuration files.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A user uses the sample configuration file `/code/tests/sample_config.yml` directly without replacing the hardcoded developer key.
    *   The sample configuration file (or a configuration file based on it) is accidentally exposed, for example, by being committed to a public version control repository.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  Inspect the file `/code/tests/sample_config.yml`.
    2.  Observe the line `developer_key: A`.
    3.  This line directly assigns the value "A" as the `developer_key`, which is a hardcoded credential.
    ```yaml
    # /code/tests/sample_config.yml
    developer_key:
      A
    customer_id:
      0
    bq_project:
      a
    bq_dataset:
      t
    # parameters used to generate ADH temp table
    date_range_setup:
      start_date: YYYYMMDD-10
      end_date: YYYYMMDD-1
    queries_setup:
      - queries:
        - a3
        - a4
        parameters:
          s:
            type: STRING
          e:
            type: STRING
        filtered_row_summary:
          text:
            type: CONSTANT
            value: filtered
        execution_mode: batch
        wait: block
    ```
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Manual Inspection:** Open the file `/code/tests/sample_config.yml` in a text editor or directly through a code repository browser (e.g., on GitHub).
    2.  **Verify Hardcoded Key:** Locate the line `developer_key: A`. Observe that the developer key is explicitly set to a static value "A" within the configuration file.
    3.  **Conclude Vulnerability:** Based on the direct presence of a hardcoded developer key in the sample configuration, conclude that this constitutes a potential vulnerability if this file is misused or exposed.

### Vulnerability 2: Potential Exposure of Service Account Key File Path in Configuration

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Service Account Key File Path Exposure via Configuration File
*   **Description:** While the `adm.py` script correctly retrieves the service account key file path from the environment variable `ADH_SECRET_FILE`, the project's documentation and the use of configuration files (`config.yml`) for other settings create an indirect vulnerability. Users might be tempted, for convenience, to store the path to their sensitive service account key file within the `config.yml` file or similar configuration files that are managed alongside the project. If these configuration files are not properly secured (e.g., accidentally committed to version control, stored in insecure locations), the path to the service account key file could be exposed to unauthorized parties. An attacker gaining access to this path, and potentially the configuration file itself if it contains the path directly, could then attempt to access the service account key file and gain unauthorized access to the Ads Data Hub API.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of the service account key file path, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Ads Data Hub API if the attacker can access the key file itself.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** The `adm.py` script itself reads the secret file path from an environment variable, which is a good practice.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Strongly discourage storing paths to sensitive credential files within any configuration files managed by the project.
    *   In documentation and examples, explicitly advise users to manage service account key files and OAuth 2.0 credentials securely, emphasizing the risks of storing file paths in configuration files.
    *   Recommend using environment variables or secure secret management solutions for handling credential file paths and the credentials themselves.
    *   Consider adding a security warning to the documentation about the risks of exposing credential file paths and credentials.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A user, misunderstanding best practices or for convenience, stores the path to their service account key file within a configuration file (like `config.yml`) managed by the project.
    *   This configuration file is then exposed to an attacker, for example, by being committed to a public version control repository or stored in an insecure location.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  Examine `/code/cli/adm.py`: Observe that the script uses `os.environ['ADH_SECRET_FILE']` to retrieve the path, showing awareness of environment variables for secrets.
    2.  Review `README.md`: Notice examples and instructions that heavily rely on `config.yml` for project configuration. The documentation encourages the use of configuration files for various settings.
    3.  Infer User Behavior: Recognize that users might extend the use of `config.yml` to store the path to the service account key file alongside other configuration parameters for convenience, despite the script reading it from an environment variable.
    4.  Identify Risk: Understand that if users store the path in `config.yml` and expose this file, they indirectly expose the location of a sensitive credential file.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Code Review `adm.py`:** Inspect the `adm.py` script and confirm it retrieves the credential file path from the `ADH_SECRET_FILE` environment variable, which is secure in principle.
    2.  **Documentation Review `README.md`:** Read through the `README.md` and note the emphasis on using `config.yml` for configuration. Observe examples that show configuration file usage.
    3.  **Scenario Creation (Hypothetical User Error):** Imagine a user who, for simplicity, decides to add a line like `adh_secret_file_path: /path/to/credentials.json` to their `config.yml` file, even though the script expects the environment variable.
    4.  **Simulate Exposure:** Assume this user then accidentally commits their `config.yml` file to a public repository.
    5.  **Conclude Vulnerability:** Based on the project's encouragement of configuration files and the likely user tendency to consolidate settings, conclude that there is a vulnerability arising from the potential exposure of the service account key file path if users are not explicitly warned against storing such paths in configuration files and educated on secure credential management practices.
