Based on the provided vulnerability list and instructions, both vulnerabilities are valid and should be included in the updated list. They both relate to configuration manipulation, are realistic, well-described, evidenced in the source code analysis, and are ranked as high severity.

Here is the updated list in markdown format:

### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Configuration Injection - Customer IDs and Ads Data From Manipulation
* Description:
    An attacker who gains write access to the `config.yml` file can modify the `customer_ids` and `ads_data_from` parameters. These parameters are used to specify the Google Ads Data Hub (ADH) customer IDs for which queries are deployed and from which ads data is accessed. By altering these values, an attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to data belonging to different ADH customers or manipulate queries to run against unintended customer data.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `config.yml` file within the deployment project.
    2. The attacker modifies the `customer_ids` list or the `ads_data_from` list in the `config.yml` file to include ADH customer IDs that they are not authorized to access.
    3. The attacker executes any command that utilizes the configuration file, such as `adm run` or `adm deploy`.
    4. The application, using the modified `config.yml`, will then use the attacker-specified customer IDs in subsequent API calls to ADH.
    5. If the attacker's account has sufficient permissions within the Ads Data Hub project associated with the modified customer IDs (or if there are misconfigurations in ADH permissions), the attacker may successfully deploy or run queries against these unauthorized customer IDs, potentially exfiltrating or manipulating sensitive data.

* Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data from Google Ads Data Hub belonging to customer IDs that they are not authorized to access.
    - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate or corrupt data within the Ads Data Hub environment by running queries with modified customer ID configurations.
    - **Compliance Violation:** Accessing and manipulating data of unauthorized customers can lead to serious compliance violations and legal repercussions.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application currently reads and uses the `customer_ids` and `ads_data_from` values from the `config.yml` file without any validation or authorization checks.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation for `customer_ids` and `ads_data_from` in `config.py` to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., numeric values) and potentially check against an allowed list or authorized customer IDs.
    - **Authorization Checks:**  Ideally, the application should incorporate an authorization mechanism to verify that the user or service account running the deployment has the necessary permissions to access and process data for the specified `customer_ids` and `ads_data_from`. This could involve integrating with an identity and access management (IAM) system.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Recommend and document that users should grant the service account running the deployment manager only the minimum necessary permissions in Google Ads Data Hub and related Google Cloud projects.
    - **Configuration File Protection:**  Document and emphasize the importance of securing the `config.yml` file and restricting write access to authorized personnel only. This is an infrastructure-level mitigation, but crucial.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must gain write access to the `config.yml` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising the system where the file is stored, exploiting vulnerabilities in related systems, or through insider threats.
    - The attacker needs to have some level of access to the Google Cloud project and ADH API to execute the `adm` tool and trigger API calls.
    - The targeted Ads Data Hub environment must not have overly restrictive access controls that would prevent the attacker's actions even with modified configurations (though relying solely on ADH access controls is not a sufficient mitigation within the deployment manager itself).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/config.py`:**
        - The `Config` class in `config.py` reads the `config.yml` file and directly accesses the `customer_id` and `ads_data_from` values from the loaded YAML data without any validation.
        ```python
        class Config:
            def __init__(self, path, working_directory=None):
                # ...
                self.config = self.get_config()
                self.customer_id = self._atomic_to_list(self.config.get("customer_id")) # Vulnerable line
                self.ads_data_from = self._atomic_to_list(
                    self.config.get("ads_data_from")) or self._atomic_to_list( # Vulnerable line
                        self.config.get("customer_id"))
                # ...
        ```
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/deployment.py`:**
        - The `Deployment` class initializes the `Config` object, making the potentially attacker-modified `customer_ids` and `ads_data_from` accessible throughout the application.
        ```python
        class Deployment:
            def __init__(self, ... config, ...):
                self.config = Config(config) # Config object is created here, parsing config.yml
                # ...
            def _get_queries(self, is_buildable=False):
                for query in self.config.queries:
                    # ...
                    for customer_id, ads_data_from in zip(self.config.customer_id, # Vulnerable line: using config.customer_id
                                                      self.config.ads_data_from): # Vulnerable line: using config.ads_data_from
                        analysis_query = AnalysisQuery(
                            adh_service=self.adh_service.adh_service,
                            customer_id=customer_id, # Vulnerable line: using customer_id from config
                            ads_data_from=ads_data_from, # Vulnerable line: using ads_data_from from config
                            query=adh_query)
                        # ...
        ```
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/query.py`:**
        - The `AnalysisQuery` class uses the `customer_id` and `ads_data_from` values (originating from `config.yml`) when making API calls to ADH.
        ```python
        class AnalysisQuery(AdhQuery):
            def __init__(self, ..., customer_id, ads_data_from=None, ...):
                # ...
                self.customer_id = f"customers/{customer_id:>09}" # Vulnerable line: using customer_id from Deployment (config.yml)
                self.ads_data_from = f"{ads_data_from:>09}" if ads_data_from else f"{customer_id:>09}" # Vulnerable line: using ads_data_from from Deployment (config.yml)
                # ...
            def _run(self, ...):
                queryExecuteBody: Dict[str, Any] = {
                    "spec": {
                        "adsDataCustomerId": self.ads_data_from, # Vulnerable line: using self.ads_data_from
                        # ...
                    },
                    # ...
                }
                # ...
                op = (self.adh_service.customers().analysisQueries().start(
                    name=self.name, body=queryExecuteBody)) # API call with customer IDs
                return op
        ```

    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Set up a test environment with the ADH Deployment Manager library installed and configured to connect to a test Ads Data Hub environment.
        - Have access to two distinct ADH customer IDs: `CUSTOMER_ID_A` (authorized) and `CUSTOMER_ID_B` (unauthorized - assume current user/service account should not access data for this ID).
        - Create a simple SQL query (e.g., `SELECT 1;`) named `test_query.sql` in the `sql` folder.
        - Create a `config.yml` file that initially includes `CUSTOMER_ID_A` in the `customer_ids` list and is configured to deploy and run `test_query.sql`.
    2. **Initial Deployment and Run (Baseline):**
        - Run `adm deploy -c config.yml -q sql deploy` and then `adm run -c config.yml run`.
        - Verify that the query runs successfully for `CUSTOMER_ID_A` and the output is as expected in the designated BigQuery dataset.
    3. **Modify `config.yml` to Unauthorized Customer ID:**
        - Edit the `config.yml` file.
        - Replace `CUSTOMER_ID_A` in the `customer_ids` list with `CUSTOMER_ID_B`.
        - Save the modified `config.yml`.
    4. **Attempt to Deploy and Run with Modified Config:**
        - Run `adm deploy -c config.yml -q sql deploy` and then `adm run -c config.yml run` again, using the *modified* `config.yml`.
    5. **Verification:**
        - **Successful Exploitation:** If the commands execute successfully *without any errors related to authorization for `CUSTOMER_ID_B`*, and if you can observe actions being performed in ADH context of `CUSTOMER_ID_B` (e.g., jobs started, tables created if possible in test environment), then the vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the application used the attacker-supplied `CUSTOMER_ID_B` from the modified `config.yml` without proper authorization checks.
        - **Expected Mitigation (if implemented):** If proper authorization checks were in place, you would expect the `adm` commands to fail with an authorization error when attempting to access or operate on `CUSTOMER_ID_B`, indicating that the application correctly prevented unauthorized access even with a modified configuration file.

* Vulnerability Name: Configuration Injection - BigQuery Project and Dataset Manipulation
* Description:
    An attacker with write access to `config.yml` can modify the `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` parameters. These parameters define the BigQuery project and dataset where the query results from Ads Data Hub will be stored. By changing these values, an attacker can redirect the output of ADH queries to a BigQuery project and dataset under their control. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate potentially sensitive data from the organization's ADH environment to an external location.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `config.yml` file.
    2. The attacker modifies the `bq_project` and/or `bq_dataset` parameters in the `config.yml` file to point to a BigQuery project and dataset that is controlled by the attacker (or to an unintended project/dataset).
    3. The attacker executes a command that runs queries, such as `adm run`.
    4. The application, using the modified `config.yml`, will use the attacker-specified `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` in the ADH query execution request.
    5. When the ADH query completes, the results will be written to the BigQuery dataset specified by the attacker, allowing for potential data exfiltration.

* Impact:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data processed by Ads Data Hub queries can be exfiltrated to a BigQuery project and dataset controlled by the attacker.
    - **Data Exposure:**  Data intended to be stored within the organization's controlled BigQuery environment can be exposed to external parties if the attacker-controlled project is outside the organization's security perimeter.
    - **Unauthorized Data Access (Indirect):** While not direct access to ADH data, this allows attackers to gain access to the *results* of ADH queries, which can still contain sensitive information.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application directly uses the `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` values from `config.yml` without any validation or checks.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation for `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` in `config.py` to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., project and dataset ID patterns) and potentially check against an allowed list of projects/datasets.
    - **Configuration Integrity Checks:** Consider implementing mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `config.yml` file, such as using checksums or digital signatures, to detect unauthorized modifications.
    - **Auditing:** Log the BigQuery project and dataset being used for each execution to facilitate auditing and detection of suspicious activity.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (for Service Account):** Ensure the service account used by the deployment manager has write access only to the intended BigQuery project and dataset, limiting the impact if the configuration is manipulated. However, this doesn't prevent exfiltration if the attacker *can* control a valid project.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must gain write access to the `config.yml` file.
    - The attacker needs to have a BigQuery project and dataset under their control where they can receive the exfiltrated data.
    - The service account used by the deployment manager must have permissions to write data to *both* the legitimate BigQuery dataset *and* the attacker's specified BigQuery dataset (this is often the case if the service account has broad BigQuery access within the organization's GCP project).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/config.py`:**
        - Similar to the previous vulnerability, the `Config` class reads `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` from `config.yml` without validation.
        ```python
        class Config:
            def __init__(self, path, working_directory=None):
                # ...
                self.config = self.get_config()
                # ...
                self.bq_project = self.config.get("bq_project") # Vulnerable line
                self.bq_dataset = self.config.get("bq_dataset") # Vulnerable line
                # ...
        ```
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/commands/run.py`:**
        - The `Runner` class's `execute` method directly uses `self.config.bq_project` and `self.config.bq_dataset` to construct the output table name for the ADH query execution.
        ```python
        class Runner(AbsCommand):
            # ...
            def execute(self, deploy=False, update=False, **kwargs):
                # ...
                if not self.config.bq_project or not self.config.bq_dataset: # Vulnerable line: using config.bq_project, config.bq_dataset
                    logging.error("BQ project and/or dataset weren't provided")
                    raise ValueError(
                        "BQ project and dataset are required to run the queries!")
                # ...
                job = analysis_query._run(
                    query_for_run.get("start_date"),
                    query_for_run.get("end_date"),
                    f"{self.config.bq_project}.{self.config.bq_dataset}.{table_name}", # Vulnerable line: using config.bq_project, config.bq_dataset for output table
                    query_for_run.get("parameters"), **kwargs)
                # ...
        ```
    - **`adh_deployment_manager/query.py`:**
        - The `_run` method in `AnalysisQuery` receives the fully constructed output table name (including the potentially attacker-controlled project and dataset) and passes it directly to the ADH API.
        ```python
        class AnalysisQuery(AdhQuery):
            # ...
            def _run(self, ..., output_table_name, ...): # output_table_name already includes project and dataset from config
                queryExecuteBody: Dict[str, Any] = {
                    "spec": {
                        # ...
                    },
                    "destTable": output_table_name # Vulnerable line: using output_table_name directly from Runner, which originates from config
                }
                # ...
                op = (self.adh_service.customers().analysisQueries().start(
                    name=self.name, body=queryExecuteBody)) # API call with attacker-controlled BQ destination
                return op
        ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Set up a test environment with ADH Deployment Manager and access to a test ADH environment.
        - Have access to a legitimate BigQuery project and dataset (`LEGITIMATE_BQ_PROJECT:LEGITIMATE_BQ_DATASET`) where query results are normally intended to be stored.
        - Set up or have access to a *separate* BigQuery project and dataset (`ATTACKER_BQ_PROJECT:ATTACKER_BQ_DATASET`) that represents the attacker's controlled location.
        - Create a simple SQL query (`test_query.sql`) and initial `config.yml` configured to use `LEGITIMATE_BQ_PROJECT` and `LEGITIMATE_BQ_DATASET`.
    2. **Initial Run (Baseline):**
        - Run `adm run -c config.yml -q sql run`.
        - Verify that the query results are successfully written to `LEGITIMATE_BQ_PROJECT:LEGITIMATE_BQ_DATASET`.
    3. **Modify `config.yml` to Attacker's BQ Project/Dataset:**
        - Edit the `config.yml` file.
        - Change the `bq_project` and `bq_dataset` values to `ATTACKER_BQ_PROJECT` and `ATTACKER_BQ_DATASET`, respectively.
        - Save the modified `config.yml`.
    4. **Run with Modified Config:**
        - Run `adm run -c config.yml -q sql run` again, using the *modified* `config.yml`.
    5. **Verification:**
        - **Successful Exfiltration:** Check `ATTACKER_BQ_PROJECT:ATTACKER_BQ_DATASET`. If the query results are now present in the attacker's BigQuery dataset instead of the legitimate one, the vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates successful redirection of query output due to configuration manipulation.
        - **Expected Mitigation (if implemented):** If proper validation or checks were in place, the `adm run` command might fail (e.g., if the attacker's project is not on an allowed list) or the results would still be written to the legitimate BQ dataset, indicating that the configuration manipulation was prevented.
