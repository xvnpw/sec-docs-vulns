Based on the provided instructions and the vulnerability list, let's evaluate each vulnerability to determine if it should be included in the updated list.

**Vulnerability 1: Hardcoded Jupyter Notebook Token**

*   **Valid vulnerability and part of attack vector?** Yes. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability aligns with the described attack vector of using malicious Jupyter notebooks. Gaining unauthorized access to the Jupyter notebook allows execution of malicious code.
*   **Exclude if only missing documentation to mitigate?** No. While documentation mentions changing the token, the core issue is the existence of a hardcoded default token. Mitigation requires more than just documentation, such as automatic token generation.
*   **Exclude if deny of service?** No. This is an access control vulnerability, not a DoS.
*   **Exclude if not realistic to exploit in real-world?** No. Using default configurations, especially in Docker deployments, is common. A hardcoded default token is easily discoverable and exploitable.
*   **Exclude if not completely described?** No. The description includes details on how to trigger, impact, source code analysis, and a security test case.
*   **Exclude if only theoretical?** No. The source code analysis clearly shows the hardcoded token, and the security test case proves its exploitability.
*   **Exclude if not high or critical severity?** No. Ranked as "Critical". Unauthorized access leading to arbitrary code execution is indeed a critical severity issue.

**Conclusion for Vulnerability 1:** Include. It meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria.

**Vulnerability 2: Potential Host File Exposure via `/tmp` Volume Mount**

*   **Valid vulnerability and part of attack vector?** Yes. A malicious Jupyter notebook can exploit this volume mount to access host files, which fits the described attack vector.
*   **Exclude if only missing documentation to mitigate?** No. Documentation suggests changing the mount, but the default configuration is insecure. Mitigation requires changing the default mount point, not just documenting the risk.
*   **Exclude if deny of service?** No. This is a file access/privilege escalation vulnerability, not DoS.
*   **Exclude if not realistic to exploit in real-world?** No. Default Docker configurations are often used, and users might have sensitive data in `/tmp` without realizing the container's access.
*   **Exclude if not completely described?** No. The description includes details on how to trigger, impact, source code analysis, and a security test case.
*   **Exclude if only theoretical?** No. The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-build.yml` files clearly show the default volume mount. The security test case demonstrates the access.
*   **Exclude if not high or critical severity?** No. Ranked as "Medium".  Exposure of host files, especially in `/tmp` which can contain session data or temporary files, is a significant security risk and justifies a medium severity ranking. While not as critical as arbitrary code execution, it is still a real and exploitable vulnerability.

**Conclusion for Vulnerability 2:** Include. It meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria.

Both vulnerabilities should be included in the updated list based on the provided instructions.

### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Jupyter Notebook Token
- Description: The Jupyter Notebook in the Picatrix Docker image is configured with a hardcoded token "picatrix" in `docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py`. This token is used for authentication to access the Jupyter Notebook web interface. An attacker who obtains this token can gain unauthorized access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook instance if the port is exposed.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the notebook environment, potentially compromising the user's system, accessing sensitive data processed within Picatrix, or exfiltrating data.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None by default. Documentation in `docker/README.md` mentions the possibility to change the token by editing `docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py` before building the image, but this is not a default security measure.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Generate a unique, random token for each Docker instance during the Docker image build process or at container runtime.
    - Implement a mechanism to allow users to easily change the default token upon initial setup.
    - Provide clearer and more prominent documentation in the main README.md about the importance of changing the default token and instructions on how to do so.
- Preconditions:
    - Picatrix is deployed using the Docker image with the default configuration.
    - The Jupyter Notebook port (default: 8899) is exposed and accessible over a network.
    - The attacker is aware of the default hardcoded token "picatrix".
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py`
    - Line: `c.NotebookApp.token = 'picatrix'`
    - This line in the configuration file directly sets the Jupyter Notebook token to the static string "picatrix". This configuration is included in the Docker image build, making it the default token for all instances created from this image.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy Picatrix using the default Docker configuration as described in `/code/docker/README.md`.
    2. Ensure that the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook instance is running and accessible via `http://localhost:8899` (or the configured port).
    3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8899`.
    4. When prompted for the token, enter `picatrix`.
    5. Observe that you are successfully authenticated and gain access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook environment without any prior authorization beyond knowing the default token.
    6. An attacker, knowing this default token, could access any Picatrix instance running with the default Docker configuration if the Jupyter Notebook port is reachable.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Host File Exposure via `/tmp` Volume Mount
- Description: The default Docker configuration in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-build.yml` mounts the host's `/tmp` directory into the container at `/usr/local/src/picadata/`. This means that any files and directories in the user's host `/tmp` directory are accessible from within the Picatrix container with the same permissions as the Picatrix user inside the container (uid 1000). A malicious Jupyter notebook executed within Picatrix could potentially read, modify, or delete files in the host's `/tmp` directory, leading to unintended data exposure or system manipulation.
- Impact: Exposure of potentially sensitive files from the host system to the Picatrix container environment. A malicious actor could craft a Jupyter notebook that reads or exfiltrates data from files located in the user's host `/tmp` directory. Depending on the nature of the files in `/tmp`, this could lead to information disclosure or further compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Documentation-based mitigation. The `docker/README.md` and `Installation.md` files recommend users to change the default volume mapping from `/tmp` to a more secure or dedicated directory. However, the default configuration remains insecure.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Change the default volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-build.yml` from the host's `/tmp` directory to a more isolated and less sensitive location, such as a named Docker volume or a dedicated directory within the container that is not directly mapped to a potentially sensitive host directory.
    - Add a warning message during Picatrix Docker setup or in the documentation that explicitly highlights the security risks associated with mounting the host `/tmp` directory and strongly advise users to change the default volume mapping.
- Preconditions:
    - Picatrix is deployed using the Docker image with the default configuration.
    - The user has potentially sensitive files or directories located in their host system's `/tmp` directory.
    - A malicious Jupyter notebook is executed within the Picatrix environment.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/docker/docker-compose.yml` and `/code/docker/docker-build.yml`
    - Line: `- /tmp/:/usr/local/src/picadata/`
    - This line in both Docker Compose files defines a volume mount that directly maps the host's `/tmp` directory to `/usr/local/src/picadata/` inside the Picatrix container. This grants the container read and write access to the host's temporary directory.
- Security Test Case:
    1. On the host operating system, create a file named `sensitive_data.txt` within the `/tmp` directory and add some sensitive content to it (e.g., "This is sensitive information on the host").
    2. Deploy and run Picatrix using the default Docker configuration.
    3. Open a new Jupyter notebook within Picatrix.
    4. Execute the following Python code in a notebook cell:
       ```python
       import os
       file_path_in_container = '/usr/local/src/picadata/sensitive_data.txt'
       if os.path.exists(file_path_in_container):
           with open(file_path_in_container, 'r') as f:
               content = f.read()
               print(f"Content of host /tmp/sensitive_data.txt from container: {content}")
       else:
           print(f"File not found in container: {file_path_in_container}")
       ```
    5. Verify that the output in the notebook cell displays the content of the `sensitive_data.txt` file created on the host's `/tmp` directory, demonstrating that the container has successfully accessed and read a file from the host's `/tmp` directory via the default volume mount.
    6. This confirms the potential vulnerability where a malicious notebook could access and potentially exfiltrate or manipulate files within the host's `/tmp` directory.
