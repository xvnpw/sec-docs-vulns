### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Timesketch Query Injection via `%timesketch_query` magic

- **Description:**
    - An analyst uses the `%timesketch_query` magic to search events within a connected Timesketch sketch.
    - The `timesketch_query` magic in `picatrix/magics/timesketch.py` takes a user-provided query string as input (`data` parameter).
    - This query string is directly passed to the `timesketch-api-client` library, specifically to the `api_search.Search` class, without sufficient sanitization or validation within Picatrix itself.
    - A malicious analyst could craft a query string containing Timesketch Query Language (TSQL) injection payloads.
    - This injected payload could modify the intended query logic, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive data they are not authorized to access.
    - For example, an attacker might inject conditions to retrieve events from different timelines or sketches, or use functions to extract specific user information or system configurations from the Timesketch backend if such data is indexed.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** A successful query injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the connected Timesketch backend. This could include event data, metadata, user information, and potentially even system configuration details depending on the Timesketch setup and indexed data.
    - **Data Breach:** If sensitive information is extracted, it can lead to a data breach, compromising the confidentiality of the data.
    - **Reputation Damage:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can damage the reputation of the Picatrix project and the organizations using it for security analysis.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly passes the user-provided query to the underlying `timesketch-api-client` without any input sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Picatrix should implement robust input sanitization for the `query` parameter in the `timesketch_query` magic and related functions. This should involve:
        - **Escaping special characters:** Properly escape TSQL special characters that could be used for injection attacks.
        - **Query validation:** Implement validation to ensure the query adheres to expected syntax and prevent malicious constructs.
        - **Principle of least privilege:** Consider limiting the permissions of the Picatrix user connecting to Timesketch to the minimum necessary for analysis tasks, reducing the potential impact of a successful injection.
    - **Documentation:** While not a direct mitigation, clear documentation should be provided to security analysts about the risks of query injection and best practices for writing secure queries, even if Picatrix implements sanitization.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A Picatrix environment must be set up and connected to a Timesketch backend.
    - An analyst with access to the Picatrix notebook environment must execute a `%timesketch_query` magic or similar function.
    - The analyst can be malicious or simply unaware of the injection risks and construct a vulnerable query unintentionally.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (query string) --> %timesketch_query magic --> query_timesketch function --> api_search.Search.from_manual(query_string=user_query) --> Timesketch API
    ```

    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. A malicious analyst gains access to a Picatrix notebook environment connected to a Timesketch instance.
        2. The analyst crafts a malicious query string designed to extract sensitive data or bypass access controls in Timesketch. For example, a query like `* OR _exists_:sensitive_field`.
        3. The analyst executes the `%timesketch_query` magic in a Picatrix notebook cell, providing the malicious query string as input: `%timesketch_query * OR _exists_:sensitive_field`.
        4. The `timesketch_query` magic function in `picatrix/magics/timesketch.py` receives this query string.
        5. The function calls `query_timesketch`, passing the malicious query string directly as the `query` parameter.
        6. The `query_timesketch` function creates an `api_search.Search` object and calls `search_obj.from_manual(query_string=malicious_query)`.
        7. The `timesketch-api-client` sends this unsanitized query string to the Timesketch API.
        8. Timesketch executes the query, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information if the injected payload is successful.
        9. The results are returned to the analyst through the Picatrix notebook.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Precondition:**
        - Set up a Picatrix environment connected to a Timesketch instance with a sketch containing data.
        - Ensure you have a user account for both Picatrix and Timesketch.
        - You need to know a field name that exists in the Timesketch index, but you are not supposed to have access to (e.g., a field named 'sensitive_field'). If you don't have such a field, you can test with a field you *should* have access to and observe if you can retrieve data you wouldn't normally see with a standard query.

    - **Steps:**
        1. Open a Picatrix notebook and initialize Picatrix:
           ```python
           from picatrix import notebook_init
           notebook_init.init()
           ```
        2. Connect to Timesketch and set an active sketch (replace `<sketch_id>` with a valid sketch ID):
           ```python
           %timesketch_set_active_sketch <sketch_id>
           ```
        3. Execute a potentially malicious query using `%timesketch_query`. In this example, we attempt to find if a 'sensitive_field' exists in the events, even if we shouldn't have direct access to its content:
           ```python
           search_obj = %timesketch_query '* OR _exists_:sensitive_field'
           df = search_obj.table
           print(df.head())
           ```
        4. **Verification:** Examine the output DataFrame `df`.
            - **Vulnerable:** If the DataFrame `df` contains events that include or indicate the presence of the 'sensitive_field' (or any unexpected data based on your injected query), it confirms the vulnerability. Even if the field itself isn't shown directly, the query logic might be altered to return events that should not be accessible under normal circumstances.
            - **Not Vulnerable (Mitigated):** If the query returns an error, or if the returned DataFrame is empty or contains only data expected from a standard query without injection, it suggests potential mitigations are in place (though further testing might be needed to confirm robust sanitization).

    - **Expected Result (Vulnerable Scenario):** The test case should successfully execute, and the resulting DataFrame might contain data that indicates the malicious query was effective in altering the intended search, demonstrating the query injection vulnerability. For example, if you used `_exists_:sensitive_field`, and the DataFrame is not empty, it indicates you were able to identify events containing that field, which could be considered information leakage if access to that field should be restricted. If you used a more targeted injection, the results should reflect the injected logic.
