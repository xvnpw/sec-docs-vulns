### Vulnerability List:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Timesketch Query Injection via `timesketch_query` magic

*   **Description:**
    1. A user utilizes the `%timesketch_query` magic or `timesketch_query_func()` function in a Picatrix notebook.
    2. The user provides a maliciously crafted string as the `data` parameter, intending to inject commands into the Timesketch query.
    3. Picatrix directly passes this unsanitized string to the `timesketch-api-client` library, specifically to the `query_timesketch` function and further to `api_search.Search.from_manual`.
    4. The `timesketch-api-client` sends this query to the backend Timesketch system without additional sanitization from Picatrix.
    5. If the Timesketch backend is vulnerable to query injection, the malicious query can be executed, potentially leading to unintended data access, modification, or other malicious actions within the Timesketch environment, depending on the capabilities of the Timesketch query language and backend.

*   **Impact:**
    An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary queries against the connected Timesketch instance. This could lead to:
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Accessing sensitive event data within the Timesketch sketch that the attacker is not supposed to see.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting event data within Timesketch if the Timesketch query language and backend permit such operations.
    *   **Circumvention of Access Controls:** Bypassing intended access controls within Timesketch by crafting queries that operate outside the user's authorized scope, assuming vulnerabilities in Timesketch backend exist.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Extracting sensitive information about the Timesketch system or other sketches if the backend is vulnerable.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly passes the user-provided query string to the `timesketch-api-client` without any sanitization or validation within Picatrix itself. There are no visible input sanitization or validation mechanisms implemented in the `timesketch_query` magic or the underlying `query_timesketch` function in `/code/picatrix/magics/timesketch.py`.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement sanitization of the `data` parameter in the `timesketch_query` magic and `query_timesketch` function. This could involve:
        *   **Allowlisting:** Define a strict allowlist of permitted characters or query syntax elements and reject any input that deviates from this list.
        *   **Escaping:** Properly escape special characters in the user input before constructing the query string to be sent to Timesketch.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement validation logic to check the structure and content of the query to ensure it conforms to expected and safe patterns.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that Picatrix, when interacting with the Timesketch API, operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful injection attack. This is more of a general security best practice but relevant in the context of API interactions.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The attacker must have access to a Picatrix notebook environment where they can execute magics. This could be a publicly accessible Picatrix instance or a compromised internal system.
    2.  Picatrix must be configured to connect to a Timesketch instance using valid credentials.
    3.  The Timesketch backend must be susceptible to query injection vulnerabilities. While Picatrix itself introduces the *path* for injection by not sanitizing input, the *exploitability* depends on vulnerabilities within the Timesketch backend's query processing.

            search_obj.from_manual(
                query_string=query, # User input 'query' is passed directly
                query_dsl=query_dsl,

                max_entries=max_entries)

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[User Input in %timesketch_query magic (data parameter)] --> B(timesketch_query function);
            B --> C(query_timesketch function);
            C --> D(api_search.Search.from_manual);
            D --> E[timesketch-api-client sends query to Timesketch Backend];
            E --> F{Timesketch Backend Query Execution};
            F -- Vulnerability? --> G[Potential Malicious Action in Timesketch];
        ```
    7.  **Explanation:** The code path clearly shows that the `data` parameter from the `%timesketch_query` magic is passed through `timesketch_query` function and directly used as the `query_string` in the `api_search.Search.from_manual` call. No sanitization or validation is performed on this user input within Picatrix before it is handed over to the `timesketch-api-client`.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Pre-requisite:** Ensure Picatrix is installed and initialized, and connected to a Timesketch instance (e.g., the demo instance `https://demo.timesketch.org` if permitted for testing, or a local test instance). Set an active sketch using `%timesketch_set_active_sketch <sketch_id>`.
    2.  **Objective:** Demonstrate that a crafted string in the `data` parameter of `%timesketch_query` is passed directly to Timesketch without sanitization by Picatrix. We will use a simple string that, while not necessarily malicious in itself, can be easily identified in Timesketch logs or responses if it's passed through verbatim. A more sophisticated test would require knowledge of Timesketch backend vulnerabilities to craft a truly malicious query.
    3.  **Steps:**
        ```python
        # In a Picatrix notebook cell:

        injection_string = "');SELECT SLEEP(5);--" # Example injection attempt - may not be valid for Timesketch backend, but serves to illustrate pass-through.
        query = f"message:{injection_string}"

        try:
            search_obj = %timesketch_query $query
            df = search_obj.table
            print("Query executed successfully (possibly). Check Timesketch backend logs for injection string.")
            print(df.head()) # Print first few rows if query returns data.
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Query execution failed (possibly due to injection or invalid syntax). Exception: {e}")

        # Examine Timesketch backend logs (if accessible) or monitor network traffic to confirm if the 'injection_string' was sent to the Timesketch backend as part of the query.
        # If the query executes without Picatrix rejecting it, and the injection string (or a modified/escaped version) appears in Timesketch backend logs, it indicates the vulnerability.
        # For a more definitive test, if Timesketch backend vulnerability is known, craft a query that would cause a specific observable effect in Timesketch if injected.
        ```
    4.  **Expected Result:** The test case should execute in Picatrix without errors related to input validation in Picatrix itself. Examination of Timesketch backend logs (or network traffic) should reveal that the `injection_string` (or a close variant) was transmitted to the Timesketch backend as part of the query. This confirms the lack of sanitization in Picatrix and the potential for query injection if the Timesketch backend is vulnerable. Note: the success of *exploiting* a vulnerability depends on the Timesketch backend itself, which is outside the scope of Picatrix vulnerability assessment, but Picatrix facilitates the *path* for such injection.
