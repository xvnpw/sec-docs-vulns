- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Cryptographic Implementation Guidance in Tutorials

- Description:
  1. The SCAAML project provides tutorials, specifically within `scaaml_intro/`, designed to guide users on performing side-channel attacks, particularly against AES implementations.
  2. The tutorial dataset and code target "TinyAES," which is explicitly stated as "for educational and demo purpose only" and "not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target."
  3. The documentation and tutorial materials, while mentioning the educational purpose, might not sufficiently emphasize the inherent risks of side-channel attacks demonstrated and the importance of proper countermeasures in real-world cryptographic implementations.
  4. A user, particularly one new to side-channel attacks or cryptography, might follow the tutorials and examples without fully understanding the implications or the necessary security considerations for deploying cryptographic systems in practice.
  5. By directly providing code and datasets that demonstrate successful attacks on a simplified AES implementation (TinyAES), the project could inadvertently guide users to implement similarly vulnerable cryptographic solutions if they fail to extrapolate the lessons learned to real-world scenarios and more robust implementations.
  6. An attacker can leverage the SCAAML tutorials to understand side-channel attack methodologies and then apply this knowledge to attack vulnerable systems that were developed using insecure practices potentially learned or reinforced by the SCAAML tutorials.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Users following the tutorials might develop or deploy cryptographic systems vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to insufficient emphasis on secure implementation practices and countermeasures. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, if the learned techniques are applied to real-world systems without adequate security considerations.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The `scaaml_intro/README.md` file includes a disclaimer stating: "This dataset and code is **for educational and demo purpose only**. It is not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target and we don't provide the holdout dataset to do proper evaluations."
  - The `scaaml_intro/README.md` file also mentions: "For research purpose you should instead use, when they will be available, our large scale benchmark datasets which have a wide variety of targets with different levels of difficulty and holdout datasets made on different hardware board to test model generalization."

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Explicit Security Warnings**: Tutorials and documentation should include prominent warnings about the dangers of side-channel attacks in real-world cryptographic systems and the limitations of the provided examples (TinyAES).
  - **Guidance on Countermeasures**: Tutorials should include a section dedicated to side-channel countermeasures, explaining different types of mitigations (hardware and software) and emphasizing their necessity in secure cryptographic implementations.
  - **"Secure Coding" Practices**: Tutorials could incorporate elements of "secure coding" practices for cryptography, highlighting common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  - **Emphasis on Real-World Complexity**: Documentation should stress that real-world cryptographic implementations are far more complex and require expert knowledge to secure against side-channel attacks, and that SCAAML is a tool for analysis, not a guide for secure implementation.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to have a vulnerable system that is susceptible to side-channel attacks.
  - An attacker needs to have the knowledge and tools to perform side-channel attacks, which can be gained by studying and using SCAAML tutorials and framework.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not in the source code itself but in the educational content and its potential for misuse or misinterpretation.
  - Review of `/code/scaaml_intro/README.md` and `/code/website/src/content/docs/papers/scaaml_defcon_2019.md` shows disclaimers about the educational purpose of the tutorial, but these might be insufficient to fully convey the security risks.
  - No specific code snippet is vulnerable, but the *lack* of secure implementation guidance within the educational material constitutes the vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**: Assume a hypothetical scenario where a user, Alice, is tasked with implementing a secure AES encryption system for a low-power embedded device. Alice is relatively new to cryptography and side-channel attacks. Alice discovers SCAAML and its tutorials online as a resource for understanding side-channel attacks.
  2. **Action**: Alice follows the `scaaml_intro` tutorials, focusing on the practical examples of attacking TinyAES. Alice might not fully grasp the nuances of real-world security and assumes that if she avoids the specific vulnerabilities of TinyAES, her implementation will be secure. Alice implements an AES encryption in her embedded system, drawing some inspiration from the tutorial code, but without implementing robust side-channel countermeasures, believing that the "educational purpose" disclaimer in SCAAML sufficiently addresses security concerns.
  3. **Expected Result**: Alice's embedded system, despite using AES encryption, is vulnerable to side-channel power analysis attacks due to the lack of implemented countermeasures. An attacker, Bob, with side-channel attack knowledge (potentially gained from SCAAML itself) can successfully extract the secret key from Alice's system by performing a CPA attack, similar to what is demonstrated in SCAAML tutorials, but on Alice's vulnerable implementation.
  4. **Actual Result**: Bob successfully performs a side-channel attack on Alice's system, demonstrating that Alice's system, influenced by potentially incomplete security understanding from the SCAAML tutorials, is indeed vulnerable. This validates the vulnerability: the educational material, without sufficient mitigation guidance, can indirectly lead to insecure cryptographic implementations.
