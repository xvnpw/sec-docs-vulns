## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Example Scripts
- Description:
  1. An attacker modifies an example script within the SCAAML repository.
  2. The attacker social engineers a user into downloading and running this modified, malicious example script.
  3. Upon execution by the user, the malicious script executes arbitrary Python code on the user's system.
  4. This code execution happens under the guise of legitimate SCAAML usage, potentially bypassing user suspicion.
- Impact:
  - **Critical**: Successful exploitation allows for complete control over the user's system.
  - This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Theft of sensitive data.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Further attacks targeting the user's system or network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The project lacks any implemented technical mitigations to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The project's disclaimer serves as a notice but not a technical mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Code Review and Security Audits**: Implement mandatory code reviews for all contributions, especially example scripts, to detect and prevent malicious modifications. Regularly conduct security audits of the entire project codebase to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - **Sandboxing/Virtualization Guidance**: Provide clear recommendations and documentation to users on how to run SCAAML and its example scripts within isolated environments like Docker containers or virtual machines. This limits the potential damage from malicious script execution.
  - **User Security Warnings**: Prominently display security warnings in the README and project documentation. Emphasize the risks associated with downloading and executing example scripts from untrusted sources. Strongly advise users to carefully review the code of any script before running it.
- Preconditions:
  - The user must download and execute a modified, malicious example script.
  - The user's system must have Python and all SCAAML dependencies correctly installed.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - `/code/README.md`: The README encourages users to utilize the provided examples and tutorials. It lacks any security advisories regarding the execution of scripts.
  - `/code/scaaml_intro/README.md`, `/code/papers/2024/GPAM/README.md`: These files provide instructions for downloading and running example scripts and pre-trained models, again without security warnings.
  - `/code/setup.py`, `/code/tools/run_pylint.sh`, `/code/tests/test_aes_forward.py`, `/code/scaaml_intro/train.py`, `/code/scaaml_intro/key_recovery_demo.ipynb`: These are examples of executable Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks within the repository. Modified versions of these could be used for malicious purposes.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**: Attacker creates a modified version of the `/code/scaaml_intro/train.py` script with malicious code (e.g., reverse shell). The attacker then distributes this modified script, potentially through social engineering.
  2. **Execution**: A victim user clones the legitimate SCAAML repository but unknowingly replaces the legitimate `train.py` with the attacker's malicious version. The user then executes the training script as instructed in the tutorial: `python train.py -c config/stm32f415_tinyaes.json`.
  3. **Verification**: Observe the execution of the malicious code on the user's system, such as a reverse shell connection to the attacker or exfiltration of user data, confirming arbitrary code execution.

### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Cryptographic Implementation Guidance in Tutorials
- Description:
  1. The SCAAML project provides tutorials, specifically within `scaaml_intro/`, designed to guide users on performing side-channel attacks, particularly against AES implementations.
  2. The tutorial dataset and code target "TinyAES," which is explicitly stated as "for educational and demo purpose only" and "not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target."
  3. The documentation and tutorial materials, while mentioning the educational purpose, might not sufficiently emphasize the inherent risks of side-channel attacks demonstrated and the importance of proper countermeasures in real-world cryptographic implementations.
  4. A user, particularly one new to side-channel attacks or cryptography, might follow the tutorials and examples without fully understanding the implications or the necessary security considerations for deploying cryptographic systems in practice.
  5. By directly providing code and datasets that demonstrate successful attacks on a simplified AES implementation (TinyAES), the project could inadvertently guide users to implement similarly vulnerable cryptographic solutions if they fail to extrapolate the lessons learned to real-world scenarios and more robust implementations.
  6. An attacker can leverage the SCAAML tutorials to understand side-channel attack methodologies and then apply this knowledge to attack vulnerable systems that were developed using insecure practices potentially learned or reinforced by the SCAAML tutorials.
- Impact:
  - **High**: Users following the tutorials might develop or deploy cryptographic systems vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to insufficient emphasis on secure implementation practices and countermeasures. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, if the learned techniques are applied to real-world systems without adequate security considerations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The `scaaml_intro/README.md` file includes a disclaimer stating: "This dataset and code is **for educational and demo purpose only**. It is not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target and we don't provide the holdout dataset to do proper evaluations."
  - The `scaaml_intro/README.md` file also mentions: "For research purpose you should instead use, when they will be available, our large scale benchmark datasets which have a wide variety of targets with different levels of difficulty and holdout datasets made on different hardware board to test model generalization."
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Explicit Security Warnings**: Tutorials and documentation should include prominent warnings about the dangers of side-channel attacks in real-world cryptographic systems and the limitations of the provided examples (TinyAES).
  - **Guidance on Countermeasures**: Tutorials should include a section dedicated to side-channel countermeasures, explaining different types of mitigations (hardware and software) and emphasizing their necessity in secure cryptographic implementations.
  - **"Secure Coding" Practices**: Tutorials could incorporate elements of "secure coding" practices for cryptography, highlighting common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  - **Emphasis on Real-World Complexity**: Documentation should stress that real-world cryptographic implementations are far more complex and require expert knowledge to secure against side-channel attacks, and that SCAAML is a tool for analysis, not a guide for secure implementation.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to have a vulnerable system that is susceptible to side-channel attacks.
  - An attacker needs to have the knowledge and tools to perform side-channel attacks, which can be gained by studying and using SCAAML tutorials and framework.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not in the source code itself but in the educational content and its potential for misuse or misinterpretation.
  - Review of `/code/scaaml_intro/README.md` and `/code/website/src/content/docs/papers/scaaml_defcon_2019.md` shows disclaimers about the educational purpose of the tutorial, but these might be insufficient to fully convey the security risks.
  - No specific code snippet is vulnerable, but the *lack* of secure implementation guidance within the educational material constitutes the vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**: Assume a user, Alice, is tasked with implementing a secure AES encryption system for a low-power embedded device and uses SCAAML tutorials as a learning resource.
  2. **Action**: Alice follows the `scaaml_intro` tutorials, focusing on attacking TinyAES. Alice then implements AES in her embedded system, taking inspiration from the tutorial code but without implementing robust side-channel countermeasures.
  3. **Expected Result**: Alice's embedded system is vulnerable to side-channel power analysis attacks due to the lack of implemented countermeasures.
  4. **Actual Result**: An attacker, Bob, with side-channel attack knowledge, successfully extracts the secret key from Alice's system by performing a CPA attack, similar to SCAAML tutorials, demonstrating the vulnerability stemming from potentially incomplete security understanding gained from the tutorials.

### Vulnerability Name: Side-Channel Attack Framework
- Description: The SCAAML project provides a framework and tutorials for performing side-channel attacks, specifically targeting cryptographic implementations. An attacker can use this framework and the provided resources to learn and execute side-channel attacks against vulnerable hardware or software implementations of cryptographic algorithms like AES and ECC. By following the tutorials and using the framework, an attacker can analyze power consumption traces and other side-channel leakage to extract secret keys.
- Impact: Successful side-channel attacks can lead to the extraction of sensitive cryptographic keys. This can compromise the confidentiality and security of systems relying on the targeted cryptographic implementations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Disclaimer: The `README.md` and `scaaml_intro/README.md` files contain disclaimers stating that SCAAML is not an official Google product and is for educational and demo purposes only. The `scaaml_intro` tutorial is explicitly marked as "for educational and demo purpose only. It is not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target".
- Missing Mitigations: None (by design, the project is intended to facilitate side-channel attacks for research and education). It's not about mitigating the vulnerability in SCAAML itself, but about making users aware of the risks when using SCAAML against real-world systems.
- Preconditions: An attacker needs access to a vulnerable cryptographic implementation and the SCAAML framework (which is publicly available).
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The entire repository code is designed to facilitate side-channel attacks.
  - The `/scaaml/` directory contains the core SCAAML framework code.
  - The `/scaaml_intro/` directory provides tutorials and examples on how to use the framework to perform AES side-channel attacks.
  - The `/papers/2024/GPAM/` directory contains code and datasets related to advanced side-channel attack models (GPAM).
  - The code is written in Python and uses TensorFlow for deep learning based attacks.
  - The tutorials and examples are designed to guide a user through the process of performing side-channel attacks, including data capture, preprocessing, model training, and key recovery.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Set up the SCAAML framework as described in the `README.md`.
  2. Follow the `scaaml_intro` tutorial to perform an AES side-channel attack.
  3. Download the provided dataset (`datasets.zip`) and models (`models.zip`) for the TinyAES tutorial from `scaaml_intro/README.md`.
  4. Run the `key_recovery_demo.ipynb` notebook in the `scaaml_intro` directory, using either the provided pre-trained models or train new models using `train.py` and `config/stm32f415_tinyaes.json`.
  5. Observe if the attacker can successfully recover the TinyAES key with a small number of traces as demonstrated in the tutorial, verifying the framework's capability to facilitate side-channel attacks.
