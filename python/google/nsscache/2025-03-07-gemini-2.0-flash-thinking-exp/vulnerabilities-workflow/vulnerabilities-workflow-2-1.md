### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious SSH Key Injection

- Description:
 1. An attacker compromises a remote data source (LDAP or GCS) configured for `nsscache`.
 2. The attacker injects a malicious SSH public key into the `sshPublicKey` attribute of a user entry in the compromised data source.
 3. The `nsscache update` command is executed, synchronizing the local NSS cache with the compromised remote data source.
 4. `nsscache` retrieves the user data, including the injected malicious SSH key, and writes it to the local NSS cache file (`/etc/sshkey.cache` by default).
 5. If the `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` scripts are configured as the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` in the SSH server (`sshd`) configuration, the SSH server uses `/etc/sshkey.cache` to retrieve authorized keys for user authentication.
 6. An attacker can then attempt to authenticate to the local system via SSH using the private key corresponding to the injected malicious public key.

- Impact:
 1. Privilege Escalation: If a malicious SSH key is injected for a privileged user (e.g., root or an administrative account), a threat actor can gain unauthorized privileged access to the local system via SSH.
 2. Unauthorized Access: A threat actor can gain unauthorized access to user accounts on the local system via SSH using the injected SSH keys, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or further system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The project code does not include any input validation or sanitization for SSH keys retrieved from remote data sources before writing them to the local cache file.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement validation and sanitization checks for SSH keys retrieved from remote sources. This should include:
    - Verifying that the retrieved data is a valid SSH public key format.
    - Potentially using a whitelist of allowed key types or options.
    - Rejecting keys that do not conform to expected formats or contain suspicious content.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on Data Sources: Implement and enforce strict access control policies on the remote LDAP or GCS server to limit who can modify user entries and SSH key data. This is an infrastructure-level security measure to reduce the risk of data source compromise.
  - Secure Communication Channels: Ensure that communication between `nsscache` and remote data sources (LDAP, GCS) is always encrypted using TLS/SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering during transmission. While the project likely supports secure connections (e.g., `ldaps://`, `https://`), explicitly documenting and enforcing this as a requirement is crucial.

- Preconditions:
  1. Threat actor gains control over the remote LDAP or GCS server that `nsscache` is configured to synchronize with.
  2. The `sshkey` map is enabled and configured in `nsscache.conf` to fetch SSH keys from the compromised remote data source.
  3. The system administrator has configured the SSH server to use `nsscache`'s `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` script as the `AuthorizedKeysCommand`.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The files `nss_cache/sources/ldapsource.py`, `nss_cache/sources/httpsource.py`, and `nss_cache/sources/gcssource.py` are responsible for retrieving data, including `sshPublicKey`, from remote sources.
  - The `SshkeyUpdateGetter` and `LdapSource.GetSshkeyMap` functions in `nss_cache/sources/ldapsource.py` and `nss_cache/sources/httpsource.py` fetch the `sshPublicKey` attribute from LDAP and HTTP sources without validation.
  - The `FilesSshkeyMapParser._ReadEntry` function in `nss_cache/util/file_formats.py` parses lines from the cache file, splitting each line by `:` into `name` and `sshkey` fields, without any validation of the `sshkey` content.
  - The `FilesSshkeyMapHandler._WriteData` function in `nss_cache/caches/files.py` writes the `name` and `sshkey` directly to the cache file `/etc/sshkey.cache` without sanitization.
  - The provided code lacks any explicit input validation or sanitization for the `sshkey` content throughout the data synchronization and caching process.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Environment Setup:**
     - Set up a test instance of `nsscache` with `files` cache and `ldap` source (or `gcs` source).
     - Configure a test SSH server (e.g., OpenSSH) on the same instance, using `AuthorizedKeysCommand` pointing to `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` and configured to use `/etc/sshkey.cache`.
     - Deploy a test LDAP server (or use a test GCS bucket).
  2. **Configure nsscache:**
     - Modify `nsscache.conf` to enable the `sshkey` map and configure it to use the test LDAP server (or GCS bucket) as the data source.
     - Set appropriate LDAP (or GCS) connection details, base DN, and filter to retrieve user entries with `sshPublicKey` attribute.
  3. **Inject Malicious SSH Key:**
     - On the test LDAP server (or GCS bucket), create or modify a user entry.
     - Set the `sshPublicKey` attribute of this user entry to a malicious SSH public key. This malicious key should be a valid SSH public key that can be used for authentication. For example: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC...malicious...key... attacker@example.com`.
  4. **Run nsscache Update:**
     - Execute the `nsscache update -m sshkey` command on the test instance to synchronize the SSH key cache.
  5. **Verify Cache File:**
     - Check the content of `/etc/sshkey.cache`. Verify that it now contains the injected malicious SSH public key for the test user.
  6. **Attempt SSH Authentication:**
     - Using the private key corresponding to the injected malicious public key, attempt to authenticate to the local system via SSH as the test user.
     - For example, if the test user is 'testuser', use `ssh testuser@<nsscache-instance-ip> -i <path-to-malicious-private-key>`.
  7. **Verification of Vulnerability:**
     - If SSH authentication is successful using the malicious SSH key, it confirms the successful injection of the malicious key into the NSS cache and the exploitability of the vulnerability. The threat actor has gained unauthorized access using the injected key.
