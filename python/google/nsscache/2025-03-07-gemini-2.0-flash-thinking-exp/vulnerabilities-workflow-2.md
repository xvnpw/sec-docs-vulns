## Combined Vulnerability List

### Malicious SSH Key Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious SSH Key Injection

- **Description:**
 1. An attacker compromises a remote data source (LDAP or GCS) configured for `nsscache`.
 2. The attacker injects a malicious SSH public key into the `sshPublicKey` attribute of a user entry in the compromised data source.
 3. The `nsscache update` command is executed, synchronizing the local NSS cache with the compromised remote data source.
 4. `nsscache` retrieves the user data, including the injected malicious SSH key, and writes it to the local NSS cache file (`/etc/sshkey.cache` by default).
 5. If the `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` scripts are configured as the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` in the SSH server (`sshd`) configuration, the SSH server uses `/etc/sshkey.cache` to retrieve authorized keys for user authentication.
 6. An attacker can then attempt to authenticate to the local system via SSH using the private key corresponding to the injected malicious public key.

- **Impact:**
 1. Privilege Escalation: If a malicious SSH key is injected for a privileged user (e.g., root or an administrative account), a threat actor can gain unauthorized privileged access to the local system via SSH.
 2. Unauthorized Access: A threat actor can gain unauthorized access to user accounts on the local system via SSH using the injected SSH keys, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or further system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The project code does not include any input validation or sanitization for SSH keys retrieved from remote data sources before writing them to the local cache file.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement validation and sanitization checks for SSH keys retrieved from remote sources. This should include:
    - Verifying that the retrieved data is a valid SSH public key format.
    - Potentially using a whitelist of allowed key types or options.
    - Rejecting keys that do not conform to expected formats or contain suspicious content.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on Data Sources: Implement and enforce strict access control policies on the remote LDAP or GCS server to limit who can modify user entries and SSH key data. This is an infrastructure-level security measure to reduce the risk of data source compromise.
  - Secure Communication Channels: Ensure that communication between `nsscache` and remote data sources (LDAP, GCS) is always encrypted using TLS/SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering during transmission. While the project likely supports secure connections (e.g., `ldaps://`, `https://`), explicitly documenting and enforcing this as a requirement is crucial.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. Threat actor gains control over the remote LDAP or GCS server that `nsscache` is configured to synchronize with.
  2. The `sshkey` map is enabled and configured in `nsscache.conf` to fetch SSH keys from the compromised remote data source.
  3. The system administrator has configured the SSH server to use `nsscache`'s `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` script as the `AuthorizedKeysCommand`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The files `nss_cache/sources/ldapsource.py`, `nss_cache/sources/httpsource.py`, and `nss_cache/sources/gcssource.py` are responsible for retrieving data, including `sshPublicKey`, from remote sources.
  - The `SshkeyUpdateGetter` and `LdapSource.GetSshkeyMap` functions in `nss_cache/sources/ldapsource.py` and `nss_cache/sources/httpsource.py` fetch the `sshPublicKey` attribute from LDAP and HTTP sources without validation.
  - The `FilesSshkeyMapParser._ReadEntry` function in `nss_cache/util/file_formats.py` parses lines from the cache file, splitting each line by `:` into `name` and `sshkey` fields, without any validation of the `sshkey` content.
  - The `FilesSshkeyMapHandler._WriteData` function in `nss_cache/caches/files.py` writes the `name` and `sshkey` directly to the cache file `/etc/sshkey.cache` without sanitization.
  - The provided code lacks any explicit input validation or sanitization for the `sshkey` content throughout the data synchronization and caching process.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Environment Setup:**
     - Set up a test instance of `nsscache` with `files` cache and `ldap` source (or `gcs` source).
     - Configure a test SSH server (e.g., OpenSSH) on the same instance, using `AuthorizedKeysCommand` pointing to `authorized-keys-command.sh` or `authorized-keys-command.py` and configured to use `/etc/sshkey.cache`.
     - Deploy a test LDAP server (or use a test GCS bucket).
  2. **Configure nsscache:**
     - Modify `nsscache.conf` to enable the `sshkey` map and configure it to use the test LDAP server (or GCS bucket) as the data source.
     - Set appropriate LDAP (or GCS) connection details, base DN, and filter to retrieve user entries with `sshPublicKey` attribute.
  3. **Inject Malicious SSH Key:**
     - On the test LDAP server (or GCS bucket), create or modify a user entry.
     - Set the `sshPublicKey` attribute of this user entry to a malicious SSH public key. This malicious key should be a valid SSH public key that can be used for authentication. For example: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC...malicious...key... attacker@example.com`.
  4. **Run nsscache Update:**
     - Execute the `nsscache update -m sshkey` command on the test instance to synchronize the SSH key cache.
  5. **Verify Cache File:**
     - Check the content of `/etc/sshkey.cache`. Verify that it now contains the injected malicious SSH public key for the test user.
  6. **Attempt SSH Authentication:**
     - Using the private key corresponding to the injected malicious public key, attempt to authenticate to the local system via SSH as the test user.
     - For example, if the test user is 'testuser', use `ssh testuser@<nsscache-instance-ip> -i <path-to-malicious-private-key>`.
  7. **Verification of Vulnerability:**
     - If SSH authentication is successful using the malicious SSH key, it confirms the successful injection of the malicious key into the NSS cache and the exploitability of the vulnerability. The threat actor has gained unauthorized access using the injected key.

### LDAP/GCS Injection leading to Local NSS Database Corruption

- **Vulnerability Name:** LDAP/GCS Injection leading to Local NSS Database Corruption

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker compromises or controls a remote directory service (LDAP or GCS) that `nsscache` synchronizes with.
    2. The attacker injects malicious entries into the directory service. These malicious entries are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in how `nsscache` processes and writes data to local NSS database files.
    3. `nsscache`, during its scheduled synchronization process, retrieves these malicious entries from the compromised directory service.
    4. Without proper validation or sanitization, `nsscache` writes these malicious entries directly into local NSS database files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, or `/etc/shadow`.
    5. By injecting specially crafted entries, an attacker can manipulate user accounts, group memberships, or password hashes in the local system's NSS database. For example, an attacker could create a new user with UID 0 or modify an existing user's password hash.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**: Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the local system. An attacker can gain unauthorized root access by injecting malicious user accounts or modifying existing ones. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems in the network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None**: The code does not implement any input validation or sanitization to prevent malicious data injection from remote directory services. The synchronization process directly writes data retrieved from LDAP or GCS into local NSS files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data retrieved from remote directory services before writing to local NSS databases. This should include:
        - **Schema Validation**: Enforce strict schema validation to ensure that data from remote sources conforms to expected formats and data types for NSS entries (e.g., UID, GID, user/group names).
        - **Range Checks**: Validate numerical values (UIDs, GIDs, timestamps) to be within acceptable ranges and formats.
        - **String Sanitization**: Sanitize string fields to prevent injection of malicious characters or control sequences that could be interpreted improperly by NSS or system utilities.
        - **Deny List**: Implement a deny list or blacklist to reject specific usernames, group names, or other attributes known to be malicious or dangerous (e.g., usernames like `root`, `nobody`, or group names like `wheel`, `sudo`).
    - **Data Integrity Checks**: Implement integrity checks on the data retrieved from remote directory services to detect tampering or corruption. This could involve:
        - **Digital Signatures**: If the directory service supports it, verify digital signatures on data to ensure authenticity and integrity.
        - **Checksums/Hashes**: Calculate and verify checksums or cryptographic hashes of data retrieved from remote sources to detect modifications during transit.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Compromised Remote Directory Service**: The attacker must have compromised or gained control over a remote directory service (LDAP or GCS) that `nsscache` is configured to synchronize with.
    - **`nsscache` Configuration**: `nsscache` must be configured to synchronize with the compromised directory service.
    - **Write Access to NSS Databases**: The `nsscache` process must have write access to local NSS database files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/shadow`). This is typically the case when `nsscache` is run as root or a user with sufficient privileges.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`nss_cache/sources/ldapsource.py` and `nss_cache/sources/gcssource.py`**: These source files are responsible for fetching data from LDAP and GCS respectively. The code focuses on retrieving data based on configured queries and parameters but lacks any validation or sanitization of the retrieved data. The data is directly passed to map objects.
    - **`nss_cache/caches/files.py`**: This file handles writing data to local files. The `Write` methods in classes like `FilesPasswdMapHandler`, `FilesGroupMapHandler`, and `FilesShadowMapHandler` take data from map objects and format it into strings that are directly written to files. There is no validation of the data being written at this stage.
    - **`nss_cache/maps/passwd.py`, `nss_cache/maps/group.py`, `nss_cache/maps/shadow.py`**: These files define map and map entry classes. The `Add` methods in `Map` classes and `__init__` and `__setattr__` methods in `MapEntry` classes do not perform any data validation or sanitization. The `Verify` methods in `MapEntry` classes are basic and do not prevent malicious content. For example, `PasswdMapEntry.Verify()` only checks if the `name` attribute is not None, which is insufficient to prevent injection attacks.

    ```python
    # Example code snippet from nss_cache/caches/files.py (FilesPasswdMapHandler._WriteData)
    def _WriteData(self, target, entry):
        """Write a PasswdMapEntry to the target cache."""
        password_entry = "%s:%s:%d:%d:%s:%s:%s" % (
            entry.name, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.passwd, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.uid, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.gid, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.gecos, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.dir, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
            entry.shell, # Data from remote source, no sanitization
        )
        target.write(password_entry.encode() + b"\n") # Directly writing to file
        return len(password_entry) + 1
    ```
    The code directly formats data from `entry` attributes into a string and writes it to the target file without any intermediate validation steps. This allows malicious data injected into the `entry` object (originating from the compromised remote directory service) to be written directly into the NSS database file.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Test Environment**:
        - Deploy a test instance of `nsscache` in a virtual machine or container.
        - Configure `nsscache` to use a mock LDAP server (or a controlled test LDAP instance).
        - Ensure `nsscache` is configured to update the `passwd` map and write to `/etc/passwd` (or a test file mimicking `/etc/passwd`).
    2. **Prepare Malicious LDAP Entry**:
        - On the mock LDAP server, create a malicious LDAP entry for a user. This entry should contain crafted data designed to exploit the lack of validation in `nsscache`. For example, set the `uidNumber` to `0` and `name` to `attacker`.
        ```ldif
        dn: uid=attacker,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: posixAccount
        objectClass: shadowAccount
        uid: attacker
        cn: Malicious User
        uidNumber: 0
        gidNumber: 100
        homeDirectory: /home/attacker
        loginShell: /bin/bash
        userPassword: password
        ```
    3. **Trigger `nsscache` Synchronization**:
        - Manually execute `nsscache update -m passwd` command on the test instance to force synchronization.
    4. **Verify Vulnerability**:
        - After `nsscache` completes, examine the `/etc/passwd` (or test file) on the test instance.
        - Check if a new user entry with the username `attacker` and UID `0` has been created.
        ```bash
        grep attacker /etc/passwd
        ```
        - If the malicious entry is present in `/etc/passwd` with UID `0`, the vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that `nsscache` has successfully written the malicious entry from LDAP into the local NSS database, allowing for potential unauthorized access.
    5. **Cleanup**:
        - Remove the malicious entry from the test `/etc/passwd` file.
        - Remove the malicious LDAP entry from the mock LDAP server.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage a compromised LDAP directory to inject malicious entries into the local `/etc/passwd` file via `nsscache`, leading to a critical security vulnerability.
