* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Evidence Path

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious forensic evidence file with a specially designed filename or path.
    2. The attacker submits this evidence file to Turbinia for processing.
    3. During evidence processing, Turbinia's code uses the filename or path of the evidence file in a system command without proper sanitization.
    4. The attacker's malicious filename or path injects additional commands into the system command executed by Turbinia.
    5. The injected commands are executed on the worker machine, leading to arbitrary code execution.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on Turbinia worker machines.
    - Potential data exfiltration from the worker machines.
    - Unauthorized access to the Turbinia infrastructure and potentially the wider network if worker machines are not properly isolated.
    - Complete compromise of the worker node, potentially leading to further attacks on the Turbinia system or other systems accessible from the compromised worker node.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided files, there are no specific mitigations implemented in the project to prevent command injection via unsanitized evidence paths. The READMEs and Dockerfiles focus on setup and deployment, not input validation or sanitization within the processing logic.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for evidence filenames and paths before using them in system commands.
    - Use of parameterized queries or functions that prevent command injection instead of directly embedding user-controlled strings into commands.
    - Principle of least privilege for the Turbinia worker processes to limit the impact of potential code execution.
    - Sandboxing or containerization of forensic tools execution to isolate potential exploits.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to submit evidence to a Turbinia instance, which is the standard workflow for Turbinia.
    - The Turbinia instance must process the malicious evidence file using a Task that is vulnerable to command injection.
    - The vulnerable Task must use the filename or path in a system call without proper sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided files, specific source code files are not available for analysis. However, assuming a typical Turbinia task processes evidence files by invoking external forensic tools using `subprocess` or similar mechanisms, the vulnerability could be present in any Task that constructs system commands using evidence paths.
    - **Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Example (Python):**
      ```python
      import subprocess

      def process_evidence(evidence_path):
          # Vulnerable code: Directly embedding evidence_path in the command
          cmd = f"tool -i {evidence_path} -o output"
          subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, check=True) # shell=True is often more vulnerable
      ```
      In this example, if `evidence_path` is controlled by the attacker and contains shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `$(...)`), it can lead to command injection.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      Attacker-Controlled Input (Malicious Evidence File) --> Turbinia Task (Vulnerable Code) --> System Command (Unsanitized Path) --> Code Execution
      ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy a Turbinia instance accessible to the external attacker (e.g., a publicly accessible instance or a local instance for testing purposes).
        - Ensure a Task is enabled that is potentially vulnerable to command injection (e.g., a Task that processes file paths and uses `subprocess` with `shell=True`). For this test case, let's assume `StringsAsciiTask` is modified to be vulnerable.
    2. **Craft Malicious Evidence:**
        - Create a malicious evidence file with a filename designed to inject a command. For example, create a file named `test_image_$(touch /tmp/pwned).dd`.
    3. **Submit Malicious Evidence:**
        - Use `turbinia-client` to submit the malicious evidence file to the Turbinia instance, e.g., `turbinia-client submit RawDisk -p test_image_$(touch /tmp/pwned).dd`.
    4. **Observe Worker Machine:**
        - Access the worker machine (if possible in your test setup, e.g., via SSH if testing locally or through GCP console for cloud deployments) and check if the injected command was executed.
        - Look for the file `/tmp/pwned` on the worker machine. If it exists, the command injection was successful.
    5. **Verify Results:**
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, this confirms the command injection vulnerability. The attacker successfully executed arbitrary code on the Turbinia worker by submitting a maliciously named evidence file.
