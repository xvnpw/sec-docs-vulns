## Vulnerability List for Turbinia Project

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Strings Task via Filename

- Description:
  1. An attacker can create a file with a malicious filename (e.g., `; touch injected.txt`).
  2. The attacker submits this file as evidence to Turbinia for processing via RawDisk evidence.
  3. Turbinia creates a TextFile evidence object and sets its `source_path` based on the malicious filename.
  4. The `StringsAsciiTask` executes the `strings` command, using the `source_path` of the TextFile evidence object without proper sanitization: `cmd = 'strings -a -t d {0:s} > {1:s}'.format(evidence.local_path, output_file_path)`.
  5. Due to shell=True being used in `self.execute`, the malicious filename is interpreted by the shell, leading to command injection.
  6. Arbitrary commands injected via the filename are executed on the Turbinia worker.

- Impact:
  - **Critical**
  - Full command execution on the Turbinia worker.
  - Potential for data exfiltration, system compromise, or lateral movement within the cloud environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly uses unsanitized input in a shell command.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization for filenames used in shell commands.
  - Avoidance of `shell=True` in `self.execute` when handling filenames or other user-controlled input.
  - Use of parameterized queries or shell-escape functions to prevent command injection.

- Preconditions:
  - Attacker needs to be able to submit evidence to Turbinia, e.g., by having access to the Turbinia client or a publicly accessible Turbinia instance.

- Source Code Analysis:
  File: /code/turbinia/workers/strings.py

  ```python
  class StringsAsciiTask(TurbiniaTask):
      # ...
      def run(self, evidence, result):
          # ...
          # Create a path that we can write the new file to.
          base_name = os.path.basename(evidence.local_path) # [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] base_name is derived from potentially malicious evidence.local_path
          output_file_path = os.path.join(
              self.output_dir, '{0:s}.ascii'.format(base_name))
          # ...
          # Generate the command we want to run.
          cmd = 'strings -a -t d {0:s} > {1:s}'.format(
              evidence.local_path, output_file_path) # [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] evidence.local_path, which can contain malicious filename, is used in shell command
          # ...
          # Actually execute the binary
          self.execute(
              cmd, result, new_evidence=[output_evidence], close=True, shell=True) # [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] shell=True allows command injection
  ```

  The vulnerability lies in the `StringsAsciiTask.run` method.
  1. `base_name = os.path.basename(evidence.local_path)`: The `base_name` variable, used later in the output filename, is derived directly from `evidence.local_path`, which can be controlled by an attacker through the evidence filename.
  2. `cmd = 'strings -a -t d -e l {0:s} > {1:s}'.format(evidence.local_path, output_file_path)`: The `evidence.local_path` is directly incorporated into the shell command.
  3. `self.execute(cmd, result, ..., shell=True)`: The `shell=True` argument in `self.execute` makes the system vulnerable to command injection because the shell interprets special characters in the command string.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Prepare a malicious file:
     ```bash
     touch "/tmp/evil_file_`; touch /tmp/pwned.txt`"
     ```
     This creates a file with a filename designed to inject a command.
  2. Create a RawDisk evidence with the malicious file as source:
     ```python
     from turbinia.evidence import RawDisk
     evil_evidence = RawDisk(source_path='/tmp/evil_file_`; touch /tmp/pwned.txt`')
     ```
  3. Submit a Turbinia request to process this evidence:
     ```python
     from turbinia import client
     turbinia_client = client.get_turbinia_client()
     request = turbinia_client.create_request(evidence_=evil_evidence)
     turbinia_client.send_request(request)
     print(f"Request submitted with ID: {request.request_id}")
     ```
  4. After the Turbinia request is processed, check for the injected file:
     ```bash
     # Assuming you have shell access to the Turbinia worker
     ls -l /tmp/pwned.txt
     ```
     If the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists on the worker, the command injection was successful.
     Alternatively, check Turbinia task output logs (worker-log.txt in task output directory) for evidence of command execution.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Turbinia worker by crafting a malicious filename and submitting it as evidence.
