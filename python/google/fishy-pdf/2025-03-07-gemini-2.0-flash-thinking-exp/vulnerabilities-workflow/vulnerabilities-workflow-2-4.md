### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Javascript Execution via PDF (CVE-2024-4367)
- Description:
    - A malicious actor can craft a PDF file that exploits a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367) in PDF.js, the underlying PDF rendering library used by FishyPDF.
    - When a user opens this crafted PDF in FishyPDF, arbitrary Javascript code embedded within the PDF will be executed within the context of the FishyPDF web application in the user's browser.
    - This occurs because the PDF.js version (3.10.111) used in FishyPDF is vulnerable to CVE-2024-4367, which allows Javascript execution through specific PDF features.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the user's browser when they view the malicious PDF in FishyPDF.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Data theft: Stealing sensitive information accessible by FishyPDF or other browser resources.
        - Session hijacking: Taking over the user's session with FishyPDF or other web applications if cookies or tokens are accessible.
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS): Potentially using the executed Javascript to further attack other websites or services the user interacts with, depending on the scope and permissions.
        - Defacement: Modifying the content of the FishyPDF page as seen by the user.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): The `pdfjs-server.py` script is designed to serve FishyPDF with CSP headers, read from a `_headers` file in the `third_party/pdfjs` directory. This is intended to limit the capabilities of any Javascript executed within the application, including potentially malicious Javascript from PDFs. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends entirely on the specific CSP defined in the `_headers` file, which is not provided in the current PROJECT FILES.
    - Isolated Origin Deployment (mentioned in README): The README suggests that FishyPDF is "meant to be hosted on an isolated origin". Deploying the application on a dedicated, isolated origin can limit the blast radius of a Javascript execution vulnerability, as the attacker's Javascript will only have access to resources within that isolated origin, and not to resources of other, more sensitive domains. This is a deployment recommendation, not a code-level mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Patching PDF.js: The most direct mitigation would be to update the PDF.js library to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2024-4367 and any other relevant security patches.  The current version is 3.10.111, which is known to be vulnerable.
    - Stricter CSP: If updating PDF.js is not immediately feasible, a very strict CSP is crucial. The CSP should ideally prevent inline Javascript execution (`unsafe-inline`), restrict script sources to only trusted origins (`script-src`), and limit other potentially dangerous capabilities.  The effectiveness needs to be verified by examining the `_headers` file.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to create or obtain a malicious PDF file specifically crafted to exploit CVE-2024-4367 or a similar Javascript execution vulnerability in PDF.js version 3.10.111.
    - A user must open this malicious PDF file using a publicly accessible instance of FishyPDF.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `README.md`: This file explicitly mentions CVE-2024-4367 as a vulnerability affecting FishyPDF. It states that FishyPDF is based on PDF.js version 3.10.111. Publicly available information confirms that PDF.js version 3.10.111 is indeed vulnerable to CVE-2024-4367. The README indicates that FishyPDF is a modified version of PDF.js, but does not mention any specific patches or mitigations implemented for CVE-2024-4367 beyond relying on CSP and isolated origin deployment.
    - `pdfjs-server.py`: This script is responsible for serving FishyPDF with CSP headers. It reads the CSP directives from a file named `_headers` located in the `third_party/pdfjs` directory. The relevant code snippet is:
      ```python
      def get_csp():
          with open(os.path.join(WEBROOT, '_headers')) as f:
            CSP_PREFIX = 'Content-Security-Policy: '
            lines = [l.strip() for l in f.readlines()]
            lines = [l for l in lines if l.startswith(CSP_PREFIX)]
            if len(lines) != 1:
              raise ValueError("Expected exactly one CSP line in _headers. Found: " + str(lines))
            return lines[0].removeprefix(CSP_PREFIX)

      class CSPRequestHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
        def end_headers (self):
          self.send_header('Content-Security-Policy', get_csp())
          SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.end_headers(self)
      ```
      This code reads the CSP from the `_headers` file and sets it as a `Content-Security-Policy` header in the HTTP response.  The security posture against Javascript execution attacks heavily depends on the content of this `_headers` file. If the `_headers` file is misconfigured or allows `unsafe-inline` or overly permissive script sources, the CSP mitigation will be ineffective.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious PDF:** Obtain or create a PDF file that exploits CVE-2024-4367 or another Javascript execution vulnerability in PDF.js version 3.10.111. A proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2024-4367 or a similar vulnerability can be found online or by researching PDF.js vulnerabilities around version 3.10.111. This PDF should contain embedded Javascript code that, upon successful execution, will trigger a visible indicator, such as an alert box or logging to the browser's developer console. For example, the Javascript could be `alert('FishyPDF Vulnerability CVE-2024-4367')`.
    2. **Deploy FishyPDF:** Set up a publicly accessible instance of FishyPDF. This can be done by using `pdfjs-server.py` locally or deploying it to a web server. Ensure it is serving the files from the `third_party/pdfjs` directory.
    3. **Access FishyPDF in a Browser:** Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where FishyPDF is deployed (e.g., `http://your-fishypdf-instance/web/viewer.html`).
    4. **Open the Malicious PDF:** Use the FishyPDF viewer to open the malicious PDF file created in step 1. This can typically be done by dragging and dropping the PDF onto the viewer, using an "Open File" button within the viewer if available, or by constructing a URL that directly loads the PDF into the viewer (if supported).
    5. **Observe for Javascript Execution:** After opening the PDF, observe the browser for the indicator of Javascript execution that was embedded in the PDF.
        - **Check for Alert Box:** If the embedded Javascript was `alert(...)`, check if an alert dialog box appears in the browser window displaying the message.
        - **Check Browser Console:** Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12). If the embedded Javascript was designed to log to the console (e.g., `console.log('Vulnerable')`), check the console for the log message.
    6. **Verification of Vulnerability:** If the alert box appears or the console message is logged, it confirms that Javascript code embedded in the malicious PDF has been successfully executed within the context of FishyPDF. This demonstrates the presence of the Javascript execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367 or similar) in FishyPDF.
