### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: CVE-2024-4367 - Arbitrary JavaScript Execution in PDF.js

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file specifically designed to exploit the vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-4367 in PDF.js.
    2. A user opens this malicious PDF file using FishyPDF.
    3. Due to a flaw in PDF.js version 3.10.111 (which is bundled with FishyPDF), processing of a specific PDF object within the malicious file triggers the execution of embedded JavaScript code.
    4. This JavaScript code executes within the security context of the FishyPDF viewer, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary scripts.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution within the FishyPDF viewer's origin. This can lead to:
    - **Information Disclosure**: The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive information accessible to the FishyPDF viewer, such as data loaded in the viewer or potentially cookies and local storage depending on the hosting environment and CSP.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The attacker can inject malicious content into the viewer page, potentially defacing the page or further attacking users interacting with the viewer.
    - **Client-Side Exploitation**: In more sophisticated attacks, the attacker might be able to leverage the JavaScript execution to perform actions on behalf of the user, or potentially pivot to other vulnerabilities depending on the environment FishyPDF is hosted in.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `README.md` mentions that the application is intended to be hosted on an isolated origin. This is a deployment-level mitigation that aims to limit the impact of vulnerabilities by restricting what an attacker can do even if they achieve JavaScript execution.
    - The `pdfjs-server.py` script serves the application with Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, read from the `_headers` file in the `third_party/pdfjs` directory. A properly configured CSP can significantly limit the capabilities of executed JavaScript, mitigating some potential impacts. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends entirely on the specific CSP configured in the `_headers` file (which is not provided in the project files, so cannot be analyzed).
    - FishyPDF uses "more secure defaults" as mentioned in `README.md`, but the specifics of these defaults and their effectiveness against CVE-2024-4367 are not detailed in the provided files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Upgrade PDF.js**: The most crucial missing mitigation is upgrading the bundled PDF.js library to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2024-4367 and ideally to the latest stable version to benefit from all security patches.  FishyPDF is using version 3.10.111, which is known to be vulnerable.
    - **Input Validation/Sanitization**: While PDF.js is responsible for PDF parsing, FishyPDF could potentially implement additional layers of input validation or sanitization on the PDF file before it is processed by PDF.js. However, this is complex and might duplicate efforts already within PDF.js, and upgrading PDF.js is the more direct and effective approach.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to craft a malicious PDF file that exploits the specific vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367). Publicly available information or proof-of-concept exploits for CVE-2024-4367 might be available, simplifying this step for an attacker.
    - A user must open the crafted malicious PDF file using a publicly accessible instance of FishyPDF.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`third_party/pdfjs/` directory**: This directory contains a copy of the vulnerable PDF.js version 3.10.111. The vulnerability CVE-2024-4367 exists within the JavaScript code of PDF.js in this directory.
    - **`README.md`**:  This file explicitly acknowledges that FishyPDF "was affected by CVE-2024-4367". This confirms that the developers are aware of this vulnerability and implicitly that the bundled PDF.js version is vulnerable.
    - **`pdfjs-server.py`**: This script serves the `third_party/pdfjs` directory, making the vulnerable PDF.js code accessible. It also reads CSP from `_headers`, which is intended as a mitigation. However, the provided code does not validate or enforce a secure CSP. If `_headers` is missing or misconfigured, the CSP mitigation might be ineffective.

    **To understand how CVE-2024-4367 is triggered (general description based on typical PDF.js vulnerabilities):**
    1. PDF.js parses a PDF file, which is essentially a structured file format.
    2. During parsing, PDF.js encounters a specific object type or structure within the PDF (the specifics of CVE-2024-4367 would detail the exact vulnerable object).
    3. The parsing logic for this object in PDF.js v3.10.111 contains a flaw. This flaw could be in:
        - **Type confusion**:  Incorrectly handling the type of an object, leading to unexpected behavior.
        - **Buffer overflow**:  Writing beyond the bounds of a buffer when processing object data.
        - **Logic error in JavaScript execution**:  Incorrectly constructing or executing JavaScript based on PDF content.
    4. The flaw results in the execution of JavaScript code that is embedded within the malicious PDF, bypassing the intended security mechanisms that prevent arbitrary script execution from PDF content.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup**:
        a. Deploy FishyPDF using `pdfjs-server.py` or any other web server that serves the `third_party/pdfjs` directory as the web root. Ensure it's accessible to the attacker (e.g., on a public IP or localhost for testing).
    2. **Malicious PDF Creation**:
        a. Obtain or create a proof-of-concept PDF file that exploits CVE-2024-4367. Public exploit databases or security research related to CVE-2024-4367 might provide such a PDF.
        b. Alternatively, if the technical details of CVE-2024-4367 are available, craft a PDF file that includes the specific PDF object and JavaScript payload that triggers the vulnerability. A simple payload could be `app.alert('Vulnerable!')` or `console.log('Vulnerable!')`.
    3. **Exploit Execution**:
        a. Open a web browser and navigate to the FishyPDF viewer (e.g., `http://<fishypdf-host>/web/viewer.html`).
        b. Use the viewer's "Open File" functionality to load the crafted malicious PDF file.
    4. **Verification**:
        a. Observe if the JavaScript payload in the malicious PDF is executed.
        b. If the payload was `app.alert('Vulnerable!')`, an alert box should appear in the browser.
        c. If the payload was `console.log('Vulnerable!')`, check the browser's developer console for the logged message.
        d. Successful execution of the JavaScript payload confirms the presence of the CVE-2024-4367 vulnerability in FishyPDF.
