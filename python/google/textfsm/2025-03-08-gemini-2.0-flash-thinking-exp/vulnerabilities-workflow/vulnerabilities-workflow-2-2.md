### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Regex Injection via Malicious Template
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious TextFSM template file.
    2. This malicious template contains a 'Value' definition with a regex that is designed to be harmful, such as consuming excessive resources or causing unexpected behavior during regex processing.
    3. When an application uses TextFSM to parse input text with this malicious template, the crafted regex is compiled and executed by the `re.compile` function within the `TextFSMValue.Parse` method.
    4. If the input text triggers the malicious regex, it can lead to denial of service due to excessive resource consumption, or potentially other unintended consequences depending on the nature of the malicious regex and how the parsed data is used by the application.
- Impact:
    - High: An attacker can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a crafted template that contains a computationally expensive regular expression. While full remote code execution is not directly evident from this vulnerability in the provided code, the impact could be significant depending on how the application using TextFSM handles parsing errors and resource limits.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code compiles and executes regexes provided in the template without any validation for malicious patterns or resource limits during regex execution.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for template files: Implement checks to validate the regex patterns within template files, possibly using static analysis or regex complexity analysis to detect potentially harmful regexes before compilation.
    - Resource limits for regex execution: Consider setting timeouts or resource limits for regex operations to prevent excessive consumption of CPU or memory when processing complex or malicious regexes.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If possible, execute the template parsing and text processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a malicious regex on the overall system.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to provide or influence the template file used by the TextFSM parser. This could occur if the application dynamically loads templates from user-provided sources or if there's a way to inject template content into the application's workflow.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/textfsm/parser.py`
    2. Class: `TextFSMValue`
    3. Method: `Parse(self, value)`
    4. Line: `compiled_regex = re.compile(self.regex)`

    ```python
    class TextFSMValue(object):
        ...
        def Parse(self, value):
            ...
            try:
                compiled_regex = re.compile(self.regex) # Vulnerable line: Regex is compiled directly from template
            except re.error as exc:
                raise TextFSMTemplateError(str(exc)) from exc
            ...
            if any([isinstance(x, TextFSMOptions.List) for x in self.options]):
                self.compiled_regex = compiled_regex
    ```
    - The `TextFSMValue.Parse` method takes a string `value` which represents a 'Value' definition from the template file.
    - Inside this method, `self.regex` is extracted from the template and directly passed to `re.compile()`.
    - There is no sanitization or validation of `self.regex` before it is compiled.
    - If an attacker can control the content of the template file, they can inject a malicious regex string into the `self.regex` variable.
    - When `re.compile(self.regex)` is executed, the malicious regex will be compiled and potentially cause harm when matched against input text.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious template file named `malicious_template.textfsm` with the following content:
    ```textfsm
    Value vulnerable_regex (.+)+ # Catastrophic backtracking regex

    Start
      ^${vulnerable_regex} -> Record
    ```
    This template contains a 'Value' definition with a regex `(.+)+` known to cause catastrophic backtracking, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption.
    2. Create a Python script `test_regex_injection.py` to use TextFSM to parse input with this malicious template:
    ```python
    from textfsm import TextFSM
    import time

    template_file = open("malicious_template.textfsm", "r")
    fsm = TextFSM(template_file)
    template_file.close()

    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        input_text = "A" * 30 + "!" # Input designed to trigger backtracking
        results = fsm.ParseText(input_text)
        end_time = time.time()
        print("Parsing successful, but likely vulnerable.")
    except Exception as e:
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Parsing failed, but protected from regex DoS: {e}")
    finally:
        parsing_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Parsing time: {parsing_time:.4f} seconds")

    ```
    3. Run the Python script `test_regex_injection.py`.
    4. Observe the execution time. A vulnerable regex will cause the parsing time to be significantly longer (potentially several seconds or even minutes) compared to a normal regex, indicating catastrophic backtracking and potential DoS vulnerability. In a mitigated system, the parsing should either be fast or fail safely before consuming excessive resources.

This test case demonstrates how a crafted template with a vulnerable regex can be used to exploit the TextFSM parser. An attacker could provide such a template to an application using TextFSM and potentially cause a denial of service.
