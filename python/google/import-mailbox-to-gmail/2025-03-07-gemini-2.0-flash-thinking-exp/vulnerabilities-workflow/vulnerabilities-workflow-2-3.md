- Vulnerability Name: Service Account JSON Key Exposure
- Description:
  - An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Service Account's JSON key file can impersonate the Service Account.
  - The Service Account, when properly configured with domain-wide delegation, has the authority to access all user mailboxes within the Google Workspace domain via the Gmail API.
  - Step 1: Attacker gains access to the Service Account's JSON key file. This could be through various means such as:
    -  Compromising a system where the key file is stored.
    -  Social engineering to trick an administrator into sharing the key.
    -  Exploiting a vulnerability in the storage or transmission of the key file.
  - Step 2: Attacker uses the `import-mailbox-to-gmail.py` script (or directly uses the Gmail API with the key) and the compromised JSON key file.
  - Step 3: The script authenticates to the Gmail API using the compromised Service Account key.
  - Step 4: Due to domain-wide delegation and the granted Gmail API scopes (`gmail.insert`, `gmail.labels`), the attacker can now perform actions on any user's mailbox within the domain, including reading, modifying, and deleting emails, and inserting new emails.
- Impact:
  - Critical. An attacker can gain full read and write access to all emails of all users in the Google Workspace domain.
  - This can lead to:
    - Data breaches and confidentiality loss due to unauthorized access to sensitive email content.
    - Data manipulation and integrity loss by modifying or deleting emails.
    - Business disruption by deleting critical communications or injecting malicious emails.
    - Reputational damage due to a significant security breach.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the code itself.
  - The `README.md` file contains a warning in section "A. Creating and authorizing a service account for Gmail API", step 12: "**This JSON file contains a private key that potentially allows access to all users in your domain. Protect it like you'd protect your admin password. Don't share it with anyone.**"
  - This warning is purely informational and relies on the administrator's security practices. It is not a technical mitigation implemented within the script.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secure Key Storage Guidance within the script:** The script could include more prominent warnings about secure storage of the JSON key file, potentially even checks at runtime to warn if the key file is in a world-readable location.
  - **Automated Key Rotation Guidance:**  The documentation could recommend regular rotation of the Service Account keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege Enforcement (Documentation):** While the script itself needs the specified scopes, better documentation could emphasize the principle of least privilege for the Service Account in general Google Workspace configurations, even though it's outside the script's direct control.
  - **No technical enforcement of secure key handling:** The script completely trusts the user to handle the key securely outside of the script's execution. There are no built-in mechanisms to detect insecure key storage or usage.
- Preconditions:
  - A Google Workspace administrator must have created a Service Account and enabled domain-wide delegation for the Gmail API scopes (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.insert, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`).
  - The administrator must have downloaded the Service Account's JSON key file.
  - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the downloaded JSON key file.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not within the Python code logic of importing emails, but in the inherent security risk of using and storing Service Account JSON keys.
  - The script `import-mailbox-to-gmail.py` in `main()` function, inside `for username in next(os.walk(unicode(args.dir)))[1]:` loop, calls `get_credentials(username)`.
  - The `get_credentials` function in `import-mailbox-to-gmail.py` uses `ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(args.json, scopes=SCOPES)` to load the credentials directly from the JSON file specified by the `--json` argument provided by the user when running the script.
  - ```python
    def get_credentials(username):
      """Gets valid user credentials from a JSON service account key file.

      Args:
        username: The email address of the user to impersonate.
      Returns:
        Credentials, the obtained credential.
      """
      credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(
          args.json,
          scopes=SCOPES).create_delegated(username) # Vulnerable point: loading key directly from file

      return credentials
    ```
  - The `args.json` is directly taken from user input via command line argument `--json`, making the script directly dependent on the security of the provided key file.
  - There are no checks or security measures within the `get_credentials` function or anywhere else in the script to validate the security of the JSON key file itself (e.g., checking file permissions, location, encryption).
  - The script proceeds to use these loaded credentials to authenticate with the Gmail API and perform actions on user mailboxes.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Setup:
    - As a Google Workspace administrator, follow the steps in `README.md` to create a Service Account, enable domain-wide delegation for Gmail API scopes, and download the JSON key file (e.g., `credentials.json`).
    - Create a test user account in your Google Workspace domain (e.g., `test-victim@yourdomain.com`).
    - Store the `credentials.json` in a location accessible to the attacker (for this test, you will simulate the attacker). For example, place it in the same directory as the script for easy access.
    - Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed as per `README.md`.
  - Step 2: Simulate Attacker Action:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you have saved `import-mailbox-to-gmail.py` and `credentials.json`.
    - Run the script, providing the path to the compromised `credentials.json` and a directory for mbox files (even if empty for this test, a directory is required). Create an empty directory named `mbox_test`.
    - Execute the command: `python import-mailbox-to-gmail.py --json credentials.json --dir mbox_test`
  - Step 3: Verification:
    - Observe the script's output. If the script runs without errors related to authentication and proceeds to process (even if there are no mbox files), it indicates successful authentication using the Service Account key.
    - To further verify access, you can modify the script temporarily to perform a read operation on the `test-victim@yourdomain.com` mailbox. For example, add code to list labels for the test user after the `service = discovery.build('gmail', 'v1', http=http)` line in the `main` function:
      ```python
      results = service.users().labels().list(userId='test-victim@yourdomain.com', fields='labels(name)').execute()
      labels = results.get('labels', [])
      print("Labels for test-victim@yourdomain.com:")
      for label in labels:
          print(f"- {label['name']}")
      ```
    - Run the modified script again with the same command: `python import-mailbox-to-gmail.py --json credentials.json --dir mbox_test`
    - If the script outputs the labels of `test-victim@yourdomain.com`, it confirms that an attacker with the JSON key can successfully access and interact with the mailbox of `test-victim@yourdomain.com` (and potentially any user in the domain).
