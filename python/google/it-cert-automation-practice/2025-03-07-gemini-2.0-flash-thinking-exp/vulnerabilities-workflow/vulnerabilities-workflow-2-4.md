- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Code Execution via Social Engineering
- Description: An attacker can create a modified version of a script from this repository, embedding malicious code. They can then distribute this modified script, disguised as legitimate learning material from this repository (e.g., via phishing, malicious websites, or sharing on untrusted platforms). If a user, believing it to be a safe and official script from the Google IT Automation course, downloads and executes this modified script, the malicious code will run on their local machine.
- Impact: Complete compromise of the user's local machine, potentially including data theft, malware installation, or further network access, depending on the attacker's payload.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the project files themselves. The repository is provided "as is" without specific security warnings or mechanisms against modified versions.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Clear and prominent warnings in the README and throughout the repository about the risks of downloading and executing code from any source, including this repository.
    - Instructions on how users can verify the integrity of the downloaded scripts (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures, although this might be overly complex for this type of educational repository).
    - Encouragement for users to review the code before execution and run it in a safe, isolated environment (like a VM or container).
- Preconditions:
    - User must be tricked into downloading and executing a malicious script.
    - User must have Python installed and be able to execute Python scripts.
- Source Code Analysis: The provided code itself (`validations.py`, `hello_cloud.py`) does not contain any inherent vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is not in the *code*, but in the *distribution method* and the *user's trust*. There's no specific code to analyze for this vulnerability within the provided files, as the vulnerability is about malicious *modification* of these files outside of the repository itself. The project provides practice Python scripts, which by their nature are intended to be downloaded and executed by users. This inherent characteristic creates an attack vector if malicious actors distribute modified versions.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Action:** Create a malicious version of `hello_cloud.py`. For example, modify `hello_cloud.py` to include code that sends user's browser history to attacker's server in addition to the original "Hello Cloud" functionality.
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # Copyright 2019 Google LLC
    # ... (rest of original header) ...

    import http
    import http.server
    import socket
    import socketserver
    import sys
    import os
    import json

    # TCP port for listening to connections, if no port is received
    DEFAULT_PORT=8000

    class Handler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
        def do_GET(self):
            self.send_response(http.HTTPStatus.OK)
            self.end_headers()
            # Hello message
            self.wfile.write(b'Hello Cloud')
            # Now get the hostname and IP and print that as well.
            hostname = socket.gethostname()
            host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
            self.wfile.write(
                '\n\nHostname: {} \nIP Address: {}'.format(
                    hostname, host_ip).encode())

            # Malicious code: Attempt to read browser history (example for Chrome on Linux)
            try:
                history_path = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History")
                if os.path.exists(history_path):
                    with open(history_path, "r", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
                        history_data = f.read()
                        # In a real attack, this data would be sent to an attacker's server
                        print("Extracted Browser History (Simulated Send):", history_data[:100] + "...") # Print only first 100 chars for demonstration
                else:
                    print("Chrome history not found at:", history_path)
            except Exception as e:
                print("Error reading browser history:", e)


    def main(argv):
        port = DEFAULT_PORT
        if len(argv) > 1:
            port = int(argv[1])

        web_server = socketserver.TCPServer(('', port), Handler)
        print("Listening for connections on port {}".format(port))
        web_server.serve_forever()


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(sys.argv)
    ```
    2. **Attacker Action:** Distribute the malicious `hello_cloud.py` through a social engineering attack. For example, create a fake website that looks like the official repository, or send emails claiming to be from the course organizers and link to the malicious script.
    3. **User Action:** A user, believing the attacker's claims, downloads the malicious `hello_cloud.py` and saves it as `hello_cloud.py`.
    4. **User Action:** User executes the script: `python3 hello_cloud.py`
    5. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation):** The `hello_cloud.py` script runs a web server as expected, but also attempts to read and print (or in a real attack, exfiltrate) the user's browser history in the terminal output, demonstrating the execution of malicious code alongside the intended functionality. The user's system is now compromised as the attacker could have included any malicious payload.
