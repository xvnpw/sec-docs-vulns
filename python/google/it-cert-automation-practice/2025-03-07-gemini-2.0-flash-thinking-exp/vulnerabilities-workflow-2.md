## Combined Vulnerability List:

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerability in Practice Scripts

**Description:** Learners might execute practice scripts from this repository without realizing the security implications. If these scripts interact with the operating system and use user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands. By supplying specially crafted input, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the learner's local machine. This occurs because the script directly passes unsanitized user input to system commands, allowing the attacker to append or inject commands that are then executed by the operating system shell.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the learner's local machine. This could allow an attacker to:
- Gain complete control of the learner's system.
- Steal sensitive data stored on the machine.
- Install malware, such as viruses, trojans, or ransomware.
- Perform other malicious actions, potentially compromising the learner's privacy and security.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The repository is designed for educational purposes and may intentionally include vulnerable code examples to demonstrate security concepts. There are no explicit security mitigations implemented to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in the practice scripts.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization in all practice scripts that interact with the operating system. This should involve validating and sanitizing user-provided input to remove or escape any characters that could be used to inject commands.
- **Security Warnings and Instructions:** Provide clear and prominent warnings to learners about the risks of executing untrusted code. Emphasize the importance of input sanitization and safe coding practices in the README and course materials.
- **Code Review and Security Testing:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of all practice scripts before making them available to learners. This process should aim to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities, including command injection flaws.

**Preconditions:**
- A learner downloads and executes a practice script from the repository on their local machine.
- The script interacts with the operating system and uses user-provided input without proper sanitization.
- The learner (or an attacker acting as a learner) provides malicious input specifically designed to inject operating system commands.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Consider the following Python code snippet as an example of a vulnerable pattern:

```python
import os

user_input = input("Enter a filename: ")
command = "ls -l " + user_input  # User input directly concatenated into the command
os.system(command)
```

In this code, the `user_input` from the learner is directly incorporated into the `command` string without any form of sanitization or validation. The `os.system()` function then executes this constructed command in the operating system shell.

**Step-by-step vulnerability trigger:**
1. The vulnerable Python script is executed.
2. The script prompts the learner to "Enter a filename:".
3. A malicious learner or attacker provides the input: `; touch malicious_file.txt`. This input is designed to inject a new command after the original `ls -l` command.
4. The script constructs the command string by concatenating the base command and the user input: `ls -l ; touch malicious_file.txt`.
5. The `os.system()` function executes this combined command. The semicolon `;` acts as a command separator in the shell. Thus, the shell first executes `ls -l` and then executes the injected command `touch malicious_file.txt`. This results in the creation of a file named `malicious_file.txt` in the current directory.
6. A more sophisticated attacker could inject far more harmful commands, such as `rm -rf /` to delete files or other commands to compromise the system.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Create a Python script locally named `test_command_injection.py` with the following code:
```python
import os

user_input = input("Enter a directory name to list files: ")
command = "ls " + user_input
print(f"Executing command: {command}")
os.system(command)
```
2. **Execution:** Run the script from a terminal: `python test_command_injection.py`
3. **Malicious Input:** When prompted "Enter a directory name to list files:", enter the following malicious input: `; touch injected_file.txt`.
4. **Observe Output:** Observe the output in the terminal. The script will first attempt to execute `ls` (potentially resulting in an error depending on what follows the semicolon) and then execute the injected command `touch injected_file.txt`.
5. **Verification:** Check if a file named `injected_file.txt` has been created in the current directory where the script was executed. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection.

**Explanation:** This test case demonstrates that by injecting a semicolon `;` followed by a new command, an attacker can successfully execute arbitrary commands on the system through the vulnerable script. This highlights the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in practice scripts within the repository if they handle user input without proper sanitization when interacting with the operating system.

### 2. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Practice File Distribution

**Description:** Attackers can exploit the nature of educational repositories by creating and distributing modified versions of practice files that contain malicious code. They can leverage social engineering tactics to trick learners into downloading and executing these malicious files, disguised as legitimate learning materials from trusted sources like this repository. This can be achieved through various methods, such as phishing emails, malicious websites mimicking the official repository, or sharing the files on untrusted platforms with deceptive descriptions. If a learner, believing they are downloading a safe and official script from the Google IT Automation course, executes the modified script, the embedded malicious code will run on their local machine with the learner's privileges.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the learner's local machine, potentially leading to:
- **Data Theft:** Malicious code can access and exfiltrate sensitive information stored on the learner's computer, including personal files, login credentials, and browser history.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install various types of malware, such as viruses, trojans, ransomware, or spyware, to gain persistent access, disrupt operations, or extort the learner.
- **System Takeover:** In severe cases, attackers can gain complete and persistent control over the learner's system, allowing them to perform any action as the compromised user, including further network attacks.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project, being a collection of practice files, does not inherently implement security measures to prevent users from downloading and executing modified files from untrusted sources. While the official repository is hosted on a trusted platform (GitHub), there are no mechanisms in place to verify the integrity of downloaded files or warn users about the risks of obtaining files from unofficial sources.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Security Awareness Guidance:** Include clear, prominent, and repeated warnings in the README, course materials, and throughout the repository about the dangers of downloading and executing code from untrusted sources. Emphasize that learners should only download practice files from the official repository and to be extremely cautious of files obtained from anywhere else.
- **Integrity Checks:** Provide mechanisms for learners to verify the integrity of downloaded practice files from the official repository. This could include providing checksums (like SHA-256 hashes) for each file, allowing learners to compare the checksum of their downloaded file against the official checksum.
- **Code Signing (Advanced):** For more advanced mitigation, consider digitally signing the practice files. This would allow learners with appropriate tools to cryptographically verify the authenticity and integrity of the files before execution, ensuring they have not been tampered with.
- **Sandboxed Execution Environment Recommendation:** Encourage learners to execute practice scripts in a safe, isolated environment, such as a virtual machine (VM) or a container. This would limit the potential damage if a malicious script were to be executed.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must successfully create a modified version of a legitimate practice file and embed malicious code within it.
- The attacker must distribute this malicious file through untrusted channels and employ social engineering techniques to deceive learners into downloading it.
- A learner must be successfully tricked into downloading and executing the modified practice file, believing it to be a safe and official learning resource.
- The learner must have Python (or the relevant interpreter for the practice file's language) installed on their local machine to execute the script.

**Source Code Analysis:**
The vulnerability does not reside in the original, legitimate code within the repository itself. Instead, it arises from the potential for malicious modification and distribution of these files. Consider the original `hello_cloud.py` example. An attacker could modify this file to include malicious Python code, such as the following example of adding code to exfiltrate browser history (simplified example for Chrome on Linux):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ... (rest of the original hello_cloud.py code) ...
import os
import json

class Handler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        # ... (rest of the original do_GET method) ...

        # Malicious code added by attacker: Attempt to read browser history
        try:
            history_path = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History")
            if os.path.exists(history_path):
                with open(history_path, "r", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
                    history_data = f.read()
                    # In a real attack, this data would be sent to an attacker's server
                    print("Extracted Browser History (Simulated Send):", history_data[:100] + "...") # Print only first 100 chars for demonstration
            else:
                print("Chrome history not found at:", history_path)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error reading browser history:", e)
```

In this modified version, the attacker has added code within the `do_GET` method to attempt to read the user's Chrome browser history. When a learner executes this modified script and accesses the server through a web browser, this malicious code will be executed, attempting to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data. This is a simplified example; the malicious code could be far more damaging.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Attacker Action (File Modification):** Create a malicious version of a practice file, for example, `hello_cloud.py`. Insert malicious code similar to the example above that attempts to read and print browser history or performs other malicious actions (e.g., create a file, send a network request).
2. **Attacker Action (Distribution Simulation):**  Simulate distribution through an untrusted channel. This could be as simple as placing the modified file in a folder representing "downloaded from untrusted source" or setting up a fake website that hosts the malicious file and mimics the official repository.
3. **User Action (Download & Execution):** As a simulated learner, download the malicious `hello_cloud.py` file from the simulated untrusted source and save it as `hello_cloud.py` on your local machine.
4. **User Action (Script Execution):** Execute the downloaded script using Python: `python3 hello_cloud.py`
5. **User Action (Trigger Malicious Code):** If the malicious code is in a web server script (like `hello_cloud.py`), access the server in a web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). This will trigger the `do_GET` method and execute the malicious code within it.
6. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation):** Observe the output in the terminal where you ran the script. If the malicious code is designed to print browser history (as in the example), you should see a portion of the browser history printed in the terminal. Alternatively, if the malicious code performs another action (like creating a file), verify that action has been successfully performed (e.g., check for the creation of the file). This confirms that arbitrary code execution has occurred due to the execution of the malicious practice file.

**Explanation:** This test case demonstrates how easily a practice file can be modified to execute arbitrary code when a learner unknowingly runs it after downloading it from an untrusted source. It highlights the vulnerability arising from the lack of integrity checks and the potential for social engineering attacks targeting learners of this educational material.
