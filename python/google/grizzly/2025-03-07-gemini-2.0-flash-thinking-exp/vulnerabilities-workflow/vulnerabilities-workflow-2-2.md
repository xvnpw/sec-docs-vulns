- ### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Default Security User Configuration in Environment Initialization Script
  - Description:
    1. The `init_grizzly_environment_from_scratch.sh` script initializes the Grizzly environment.
    2. If the `--SECURITY_USER` parameter is not provided during script execution, the script defaults to using the email from the Git configuration (`git config user.email`).
    3. This default configuration might lead to unintended access if the Git user email is not properly secured or represents a shared account, potentially granting demo example access to an unintended user.
  - Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to Grizzly demo examples and potentially underlying BigQuery data if the default security user is compromised or misconfigured.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The script allows users to explicitly set the `--SECURITY_USER` parameter during environment initialization.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - The script should enforce a stronger default, such as requiring the `--SECURITY_USER` parameter to be explicitly set and validated, instead of relying on potentially insecure Git configuration.
    - Documentation should strongly emphasize the importance of setting a secure `SECURITY_USER` and the risks of using the Git default.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be aware that the Grizzly deployment script uses a default `SECURITY_USER` from Git configuration when the parameter is not provided.
    - The attacker needs to gain control or knowledge of the Git user email configured in the environment where Grizzly is being deployed.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    ```bash
    File: /code/tools/init_grizzly_environment_from_scratch.sh
    ...
    if [[ "$SECURITY_USER" == "" ]] || [[ "$SECURITY_USER" == "NA" ]]; then
        SECURITY_USER="user:$(git config user.email)"
        echo "$SECURITY_USER account will be used as default in BQ security scripts"
    fi
    ...
    ```
    - The code snippet shows that if `--SECURITY_USER` is not provided, the script automatically sets `SECURITY_USER` to the email configured in Git. This default behavior can be insecure.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a Grizzly environment without providing the `--SECURITY_USER` parameter to `init_grizzly_environment_from_scratch.sh`.
    2. Observe the script output, which will indicate that the Git user email is being used as the default `SECURITY_USER`.
    3. As an attacker, if you know or can control the Git user email in the deployment environment, you could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Grizzly demo examples.
    4. Attempt to access the Grizzly demo examples using the default `SECURITY_USER` (the Git user email). If access is granted without explicit configuration of a secure user, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- ### Vulnerability Name: Potential Exposure of Configuration Values via Superset Default Connection
  - Description:
    1. The `documentation/install.md` provides instructions to optionally install and configure Superset.
    2. In step 12.1.3, it instructs users to create a BigQuery connection named `bq_connection` in Superset using a Service Account Key JSON file downloaded from the GCP project.
    3. If the Superset instance is publicly accessible or compromised, an attacker could potentially export the database connection details from Superset, which may include the Service Account Key JSON.
    4. This Service Account Key, if exported, could grant unauthorized access to BigQuery resources if it has overly permissive roles (as suggested by the documentation for demo purposes - BigQuery Data Viewer, BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Read Session User).
  - Impact:
    - Potential unauthorized access to BigQuery data if the Superset instance is compromised and the database connection details, including the Service Account Key, are exported by an attacker.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The Superset installation and configuration step is optional.
    - The documentation mentions creating a Service Account Key with "BigQuery Data Viewer, BigQuery Job User, and BigQuery Read Session User permissions," which limits the scope of potential damage compared to Owner access.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation should strongly advise against using Service Account Keys with broad permissions for Superset connections, even for demo purposes.
    -  It should recommend using more secure authentication methods for Superset connecting to BigQuery in production environments, such as workload identity or user-managed service accounts with tightly scoped IAM roles.
    -  Emphasize securing the Superset instance itself to prevent unauthorized access to its configuration.
  - Preconditions:
    - The administrator must have chosen to install and configure the optional Superset application following the instructions in `documentation/install.md`.
    - The Superset instance must be publicly accessible or vulnerable to compromise.
    - The attacker needs to gain access to the Superset application and be able to export database connection details.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - No direct source code vulnerability in the provided files. This is a configuration vulnerability stemming from documentation instructions.
    - The relevant part is in `/code/documentation/install.md` step 12, specifically 12.1.3 and the associated images showing the Superset configuration.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a Grizzly environment and optionally install and configure Superset as per `documentation/install.md` step 12.
    2. Ensure the Superset instance is accessible (e.g., via `http://localhost:8080` as per instructions, or deployed publicly for a more realistic attack scenario).
    3. As an attacker with access to Superset (e.g., using default admin credentials if unchanged or through other means), navigate to the database connections settings.
    4. Attempt to export or view the details of the `bq_connection` database connection.
    5. If the Service Account Key JSON or its sensitive contents are retrievable, the vulnerability is confirmed, as it could be used to access BigQuery outside of Superset with the permissions granted to the Service Account.

- ### Vulnerability Name: Potential SQL Injection in User-Defined SQL Queries (YAML Configuration)
  - Description:
    1. Grizzly allows users to define SQL queries in YAML configuration files for data transformation and loading.
    2. Specifically, `stage_loading_query` in YAML files like `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml` and others,  defines SQL queries to be executed.
    3. If these SQL queries are dynamically constructed based on external input or other user-controlled YAML parameters without proper sanitization, they could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    4. An attacker could potentially modify YAML files (if they gain write access to the Git repository or influence the YAML configuration through other means) to inject malicious SQL code within these queries.
  - Impact:
    - Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to bypass intended data access controls, potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the BigQuery data warehouse.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project relies on user-defined SQL queries, and there is no automated input sanitization or parameterized query mechanism evident in the provided files to prevent SQL injection within these user-defined queries.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement input sanitization or parameterized queries for all dynamically constructed SQL statements within the Grizzly framework, especially when incorporating user-defined YAML parameters or external inputs into SQL queries.
    -  Provide secure coding guidelines and documentation to users on how to write secure SQL queries and avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities when creating or modifying YAML configurations.
    -  Consider implementing static analysis tools to scan YAML and SQL configurations for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development and deployment.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the YAML configuration files within the Git repository or influence the configuration parameters that are used to construct SQL queries. This could be through direct write access to the repository, exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify files, or influencing configuration through external systems if integrated.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided files do not contain the core execution engine that processes YAML and SQL files. To fully analyze this vulnerability, the code that parses YAML files and executes SQL queries based on configurations (likely within the `grizzly` Python package, not provided here) would need to be reviewed.
    - The vulnerability is theoretical based on the project description and the use of user-defined SQL and YAML, but concrete source code analysis cannot be performed with the provided files to pinpoint the exact injection points and confirm exploitability.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. To test this, you would need access to the Grizzly execution environment and the ability to modify YAML files (this test would likely be performed in a development/testing environment, not production).
    2. Identify a YAML file that defines a `stage_loading_query` and where parts of the SQL query might be constructed dynamically or influenced by YAML parameters. For example, if a YAML parameter is used in a `WHERE` clause or `LIMIT` clause of the SQL query.
    3. Modify the YAML file to inject malicious SQL code within the `stage_loading_query`. For example, if a YAML parameter `filter_value` is used in the query like `SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE column1 = '{{ filter_value }}'`, try to change the YAML to set `filter_value` to something like `'value' OR 1=1 --`.
    4. Run the Grizzly ETL process that uses the modified YAML file (e.g., by triggering the relevant Airflow DAG).
    5. Monitor the execution logs and BigQuery audit logs to see if the injected SQL code is executed and if it results in unintended data access or modification. For example, check if the injected `OR 1=1` bypasses the intended filter and retrieves more data than expected, or if you can inject `DROP TABLE ...` statements.
    6. If the injected SQL code is successfully executed and has a malicious impact, the SQL injection vulnerability is confirmed.

- ### Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Outbound Data Export Configurations
  - Description:
    1. Grizzly provides functionality to export data from BigQuery to Cloud Storage via YAML configurations, as seen in `/code/grizzly_example/base/bas_austin_crime_with_date/bas_austin_crime_with_date.export_to_gs.yml` and `/code/grizzly_example/store_research/prs_store_research.locations.outbound.yml`.
    2. These YAML files specify `job_write_mode: EXPORT_DATA` and `stage_loading_query` to define the data to be exported.
    3. If these export configurations are not carefully reviewed and secured, they could be misconfigured to export sensitive data to a publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket or without proper access controls.
    4. An attacker could potentially modify these YAML files (if they gain write access to the Git repository) to exfiltrate sensitive data by changing the `stage_loading_query` to select sensitive information and/or modifying the export destination.
  - Impact:
    - Exposure of sensitive data if outbound data export configurations are misconfigured to export data to insecure or unintended locations.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project relies on user-defined YAML configurations for data export, and there are no automated checks in the provided files to prevent overly permissive or insecure export configurations.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement validation checks on outbound data export configurations to ensure that exported data is not inadvertently exposed to public or unauthorized locations.
    -  Provide secure configuration guidelines and documentation to users on how to securely configure data exports, emphasizing the importance of access controls on destination Cloud Storage buckets and reviewing the data selected for export in `stage_loading_query`.
    -  Consider implementing automated checks or policy enforcement to prevent exports to public buckets or without proper review and approval, especially for sensitive datasets.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the YAML configuration files within the Git repository, specifically those defining data export jobs.
    - The Grizzly deployment must be configured to execute these export jobs based on the modified YAML.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided files do not contain the core logic that processes the `EXPORT_DATA` job_write_mode and executes the data export. To fully analyze this vulnerability, the code that handles data export configurations (likely within the `grizzly` Python package, not provided here) would need to be reviewed.
    - The vulnerability is theoretical based on the project description and the presence of data export configurations in YAML files. Concrete source code analysis cannot be performed with the provided files to confirm the lack of security checks in export configurations.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. To test this, you would need access to the Grizzly execution environment and the ability to modify YAML files (this test would likely be performed in a development/testing environment, not production).
    2. Identify a YAML file that defines a data export job (e.g., `*.outbound.yml` or one with `job_write_mode: EXPORT_DATA`).
    3. Modify the YAML file to change the `stage_loading_query` to select sensitive data from a BigQuery table. For example, if the original query selects from a public dataset, change it to select from a table containing sensitive information (in a test environment).
    4. Modify the YAML file to change the export destination to a publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket or a bucket with less restrictive access controls than intended.
    5. Run the Grizzly ETL process that uses the modified YAML file (e.g., by triggering the relevant Airflow DAG).
    6. Check the Cloud Storage bucket specified in the modified YAML. If the sensitive data from BigQuery is successfully exported to the bucket and is accessible to unauthorized users due to misconfiguration, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- ### Vulnerability Name: Missing Input Validation in Source Data URLs
  - Description:
    1. Several YAML configurations, such as `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/bas_geo_australia.post_codes.yml` and `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/bas_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode.yml`, use `source_data_url` to specify external data sources.
    2. If the Grizzly framework does not properly validate these URLs, an attacker could potentially modify YAML files (if they gain write access) to point `source_data_url` to malicious or unintended URLs.
    3. This could lead to the ingestion of malicious data into the BigQuery data warehouse, or potentially trigger other vulnerabilities depending on how the data is processed and how external resources are handled.
  - Impact:
    - Ingestion of malicious or unintended data into the BigQuery data warehouse, potentially leading to data corruption, logic flaws in downstream processing, or other security issues depending on the nature of the malicious data and how it is handled by Grizzly.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The provided files do not show any input validation being performed on `source_data_url` values within the Grizzly framework itself.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement input validation for `source_data_url` in the Grizzly framework to ensure that URLs are from expected and trusted domains and conform to expected formats.
    -  Consider using whitelisting of allowed domains or URL schemes for data sources.
    -  Implement checks to verify the integrity and authenticity of data downloaded from external URLs, such as using checksums or digital signatures, if applicable.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify the YAML configuration files within the Git repository, specifically those that use `source_data_url`.
    - The Grizzly deployment must be configured to execute ETL jobs based on the modified YAML.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided files do not contain the core logic that processes YAML configurations and fetches data from `source_data_url`. To fully analyze this vulnerability, the code that handles data extraction from external URLs (likely within the `grizzly` Python package, specifically extractors like `ExtractorCSV`, `ExtractorExcel`, `ExtractorShapefile`, not provided here) would need to be reviewed to see if any URL validation or sanitization is performed before fetching and processing data.
    - The vulnerability is theoretical based on the project description and the use of external data source URLs in YAML files. Concrete source code analysis cannot be performed with the provided files to confirm the absence of URL validation.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. To test this, you would need access to the Grizzly execution environment and the ability to modify YAML files (this test would likely be performed in a development/testing environment, not production).
    2. Identify a YAML file that uses `source_data_url` (e.g., `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/bas_geo_australia.post_codes.yml`).
    3. Modify the YAML file to change the `source_data_url` to point to a malicious URL that you control. This malicious URL could host a file with:
        - Valid data, but with subtly altered or corrupted content to test for data integrity issues.
        - Data that is not in the expected format to test for error handling.
        - Potentially malicious content, if the framework attempts to process or execute the downloaded data in an unsafe manner (less likely in this specific context, but worth considering in broader security assessments).
    4. Run the Grizzly ETL process that uses the modified YAML file (e.g., by triggering the relevant Airflow DAG).
    5. Monitor the execution logs and the BigQuery data warehouse to see if the data from the malicious URL is ingested.
    6. Examine the ingested data in BigQuery to check for data corruption or unexpected content. If malicious or unintended data is successfully ingested, the lack of input validation on `source_data_url` is confirmed as a vulnerability.
