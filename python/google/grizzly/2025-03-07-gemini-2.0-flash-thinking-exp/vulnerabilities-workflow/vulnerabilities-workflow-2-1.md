- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Stage Loading Queries

- Description:
  1. The Grizzly platform uses YAML configuration files to define ETL jobs.
  2. Within these YAML files, the `stage_loading_query` parameter specifies the path to a `.sql` file containing the SQL query to be executed.
  3. An attacker with control over the `.sql` configuration files (e.g., through a compromised Git repository or by directly modifying files if access controls are misconfigured) can inject malicious SQL code into these files.
  4. When Grizzly executes the ETL job, it reads the content of the `.sql` file and executes it against the BigQuery data warehouse.
  5. If the injected SQL is crafted maliciously, it can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or other security breaches within the BigQuery environment.

- Impact:
  - Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers could read sensitive data from the BigQuery data warehouse that they are not authorized to access.
  - Data Manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete data within the BigQuery data warehouse, leading to data integrity issues or data loss.
  - Potential for further exploitation: In severe cases, successful SQL injection might be leveraged to gain further control over the underlying Google Cloud infrastructure, depending on the permissions of the service account used by Grizzly.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None evident from the provided project files. The code appears to directly execute SQL queries from configuration files without input sanitization or parameterized queries.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: The Grizzly platform should sanitize or validate the content of `.sql` files to prevent the execution of malicious SQL code. However, sanitizing SQL in a general way is extremely complex and prone to bypasses.
  - Parameterized Queries: Instead of directly embedding configuration values into SQL queries by string concatenation or templating, parameterized queries should be used. This would prevent injected SQL code from being interpreted as part of the query structure.
  - Least Privilege: Ensure that the service account used by Grizzly to execute BigQuery jobs has the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the impact of a successful SQL injection.

- Preconditions:
  1. Attacker needs to have the ability to modify the content of `.sql` files used by Grizzly. This could be achieved by:
     - Compromising the Git repository where Grizzly configurations are stored.
     - Gaining unauthorized access to the storage location (e.g., Cloud Storage bucket) where `.sql` files are deployed.
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Grizzly platform itself to modify configuration files.
  2. Grizzly platform must be deployed and configured to execute ETL jobs based on these modified `.sql` files.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **File: `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py`**
     - The `GrizzlyOperator` is responsible for executing ETL tasks.
     - The `execute` method in `GrizzlyOperator` calls `ETLFactory.upload_data` or `ETLFactory.export_data` or `ETLFactory.merge_data` or `grizzly.etl_action.create_view` or `grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query` based on the `job_write_mode` defined in the YAML configuration.
     - The `run_bq_query` function in `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py` and `/code/airflow/plugins/grizzly/etl_action.py` takes a `query` argument, which is directly executed using `execution_context.bq_cursor.run_query(sql=query, ...)`.
     - The `query` is sourced from `task_config.stage_loading_query` in `GrizzlyOperator.run_query` and passed directly to `grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query`.

  2. **File: `/code/airflow/plugins/grizzly/task_instance.py`**
     - The `TaskInstance` class loads configurations from YAML files.
     - The `stage_loading_query` attribute of `TaskInstance` is populated by reading the content of the `.sql` file specified in the YAML configuration.
     - **Visualization:**

     ```mermaid
     graph LR
         YAML_Config[YAML Configuration File] --> TaskInstance
         TaskInstance --> stage_loading_query_path[/stage_loading_query path in YAML/]
         stage_loading_query_path --> SQL_File[.sql File Content]
         SQL_File --> GrizzlyOperator
         GrizzlyOperator --> run_bq_query(query)
         run_bq_query(query) --> BigQuery[BigQuery Data Warehouse]
     ```

     - This visualization shows that the content of the `.sql` file, specified in the YAML configuration, is directly passed as the `query` argument to `run_bq_query` and executed in BigQuery. There is no evidence of sanitization or parameterization in this flow.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Precondition:** Assume an attacker has gained write access to the Git repository containing Grizzly configuration files.
  2. **Step 1: Identify a YAML configuration file using a `stage_loading_query`**. For example, `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml` which uses `stage_loading_query: queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql`.
  3. **Step 2: Modify the SQL file:** Edit the file `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql` to inject malicious SQL. For example, prepend a malicious query like `CREATE TABLE malicious_table AS SELECT * FROM bas_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode;` to the original query. The modified SQL file might look like this:

     ```sql
     -- Maliciously injected SQL to exfiltrate data
     CREATE TABLE malicious_table AS SELECT * FROM bas_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode;

     -- Original query (modified to ensure valid syntax after injection)
     SELECT
         postcode,
         sum(age_under_25 + age_25_34 + age_35_44 + age_45_54 + age_55_64 + age_65_over) as count_all_ages,
         sum(age_65_over) as count_elderly_over_65
       FROM
         `grizzly-dev.bas_geo_australia.tax_individual_age_by_postcode`
      where postcode is not null
      group by 1
     ```
  4. **Step 3: Commit and push the changes** to the Git repository.
  5. **Step 4: Trigger the Grizzly ETL job** that uses the modified configuration. This could be done via Cloud Build trigger (as shown in `/code/documentation/install.md`) or by manually triggering the Airflow DAG.
  6. **Step 5: Verify the vulnerability:** Check if the `malicious_table` has been created in BigQuery. If it exists and contains data from `bas_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode`, then the SQL injection is successful, proving unauthorized data access. Also observe Airflow logs for any errors or unusual activity.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands through configuration files, leading to unauthorized actions within the BigQuery data warehouse.
