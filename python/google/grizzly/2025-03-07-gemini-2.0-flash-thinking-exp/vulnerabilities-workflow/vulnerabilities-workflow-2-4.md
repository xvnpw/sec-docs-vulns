- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in YAML Configuration Files
- Description:
    1. An attacker identifies that the Grizzly DataOps platform uses YAML and SQL configuration files to define data warehouse operations.
    2. The attacker examines the project's YAML configuration files (e.g., `.yml` files in `/code/grizzly_example/`).
    3. The attacker finds YAML files that include parameters like `stage_loading_query`, `job_data_quality_query`, `pre_etl_scripts`, or `post_etl_scripts`, which are used to define SQL queries.
    4. The attacker crafts malicious SQL code and injects it into a project's YAML configuration file, specifically targeting parameters that are intended to be used as SQL queries. For example, modifying `stage_loading_query` in `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml` or similar files.
    5. When the Grizzly platform deploys configurations based on these YAML files, the injected malicious SQL code is executed against the BigQuery data warehouse.
    6. The attacker successfully executes arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or performing other malicious actions within the BigQuery environment.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can read sensitive data from the BigQuery data warehouse that they are not supposed to access.
    - Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data within the data warehouse, leading to data integrity issues and potential data loss.
    - Privilege Escalation: In some scenarios, depending on the service account permissions used by the Grizzly platform, attackers might be able to escalate privileges and perform administrative tasks within the BigQuery project or even the broader Google Cloud project.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided project files to prevent SQL injection from YAML configuration files. The project relies on users to provide safe SQL code in the configuration files.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict validation and sanitization of SQL queries read from YAML configuration files before execution. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data.
    - Least Privilege: Ensure that the service accounts used by the Grizzly platform to deploy and execute SQL queries have the least privileges necessary. Avoid granting overly permissive roles like `roles/bigquery.admin` if possible.
    - Code Review and Security Audits: Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the Grizzly platform, especially the parts that parse and execute SQL queries from configuration files, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    - Documentation and Security Guidelines: Provide clear documentation and security guidelines to users, warning them about the risks of SQL injection and instructing them on how to write secure SQL configuration files.
- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the YAML configuration files used by the Grizzly DataOps platform. In a typical Git-based workflow, this could mean compromising the Git repository where these files are stored or gaining write access through other means.
    2. The Grizzly platform must be set up to deploy configurations from these YAML files, which is the intended use case of the project.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Project Description and README.md: The README.md file explicitly states that the project uses ".yml and .sql file interface as the single pane of glass to configure and run" BigQuery components. This confirms that YAML and SQL files are central to the project's configuration and operation.
    2. YAML Configuration Files (e.g., `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`): Many `.yml` files throughout the project, particularly in the `grizzly_example` directory, define data warehouse operations.  These files contain parameters like `stage_loading_query` which are intended to hold SQL queries. For example, `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml` contains:
    ```yaml
    stage_loading_query: queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql
    ```
    This indicates that the content of `queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql` will be treated as a SQL query and executed.
    3. Lack of Input Sanitization: There is no evidence in the provided files of any input validation or sanitization being performed on the SQL queries loaded from these YAML files before they are executed. The scripts and configurations appear to directly use the content of these files as SQL commands.
    4. Codebase Search (Conceptual): Although not explicitly shown in the provided files, the description and file names suggest that the `grizzly` codebase (likely within `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py` or similar operator files) is responsible for reading these YAML configurations and executing the SQL queries. If this codebase directly executes the SQL strings without proper sanitization, it would be vulnerable to SQL injection.

    In summary, the project's design, which relies on YAML files to define and execute SQL operations, combined with the absence of input sanitization in the provided files, strongly suggests a SQL injection vulnerability. The system is designed to deploy and execute SQL from configuration, and there's no visible mechanism to prevent malicious SQL injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume you have access to the Grizzly project repository and can modify the YAML configuration files. Alternatively, assume you are an internal user who can influence the content of these files.
        - Set up a Grizzly DataOps platform instance according to the installation instructions (e.g., using Cloud Shell and the provided scripts like `init_grizzly_environment_from_scratch.sh` and `apply_grizzy_terraform.sh`).
        - Identify a YAML configuration file that defines a `stage_loading_query` or similar parameter that leads to SQL query execution. For example, `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
        - Modify the chosen YAML configuration file to inject malicious SQL code into the `stage_loading_query`. For example, if the original `stage_loading_query` was pointing to a file like `queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql`, replace the content of the YAML file to directly include a malicious query.
        - Example of malicious YAML content (modified `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`):
        ```yaml
        target_table_name: prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat
        job_write_mode: WRITE_TRUNCATE
        stage_loading_query: "SELECT 1; -- vulnerable query\nDROP TABLE biz_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode;"
        ```
        In this example, the injected SQL attempts to drop an existing table within the data warehouse, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL. A less destructive but equally valid test would be to inject SQL to select data from a table that the user should not have access to, or to insert data into a logging table controlled by the attacker to confirm code execution.
    3. **Trigger Deployment:**
        - Trigger the Grizzly platform to deploy the modified configuration. This could involve running the deployment scripts or any process that causes the platform to read and apply the YAML configurations.  The provided installation instructions in `/code/documentation/install.md` detail how to deploy the infrastructure, and steps 5-8 seem relevant to trigger deployments (terraform apply and `apply_grizzy_terraform.sh`).
    4. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check the BigQuery data warehouse to see if the malicious SQL code was executed. In the example above, verify if the table `biz_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode` was dropped. Alternatively, check logs or audit trails for evidence of the injected SQL commands being executed.
        - If successful, this confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands through configuration files and have them executed by the Grizzly platform against the BigQuery data warehouse.
