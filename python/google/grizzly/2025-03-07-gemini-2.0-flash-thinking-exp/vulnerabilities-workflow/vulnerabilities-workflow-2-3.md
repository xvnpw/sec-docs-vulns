- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in `stage_loading_query`
- Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker gains access to the Grizzly configuration files. This could be achieved through unauthorized access to the Git repository, a compromised deployment pipeline, or insecure access controls on the configuration files themselves.
  - Step 2: The attacker locates a YAML configuration file that defines a `stage_loading_query`, such as `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`.
  - Step 3: The attacker modifies the `stage_loading_query` parameter within the YAML file to inject malicious SQL code. For example, they could append malicious SQL after the original query, or replace the entire query. Example malicious payload:
    ```yaml
    stage_loading_query: queries/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.sql; SELECT CURRENT_USER(); --
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    stage_loading_query: "SELECT * FROM malicious_table;"
    ```
  - Step 4: The Grizzly application processes this modified YAML file. Specifically, the Airflow DAGs, configured by these YAML files, will execute the `GrizzlyOperator` with the compromised configuration.
  - Step 5: The `GrizzlyOperator`, without proper sanitization, executes the attacker-controlled SQL query against the underlying BigQuery data warehouse.
  - Step 6: The injected SQL code is executed within the BigQuery environment, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or perform other unauthorized actions depending on the permissions of the service account used by Grizzly.

- Impact:
  - Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can read sensitive data from the data warehouse, potentially including customer data, financial records, or intellectual property.
  - Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, or financial loss.
  - Privilege Escalation: In some scenarios, depending on the database setup and permissions, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges or gain control over the BigQuery instance.
  - Data Exfiltration: Attackers can exfiltrate large volumes of data from the data warehouse.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - No mitigations are currently implemented in the provided project files to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `stage_loading_query` parameter. The code directly executes the SQL queries defined in the YAML configuration files without any input validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all SQL queries defined in YAML configuration files, especially the `stage_loading_query` parameter.
  - Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries: Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
  - Least Privilege Principle: Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user or service account used by Grizzly to interact with BigQuery. Limit the permissions of this account to the bare minimum required for the application to function, reducing the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
  - Secure Configuration Management: Implement secure configuration management practices to protect YAML configuration files from unauthorized access and modification. This includes access controls, version control, and regular security audits.

- Preconditions:
  - Access to Configuration Files: The attacker must have the ability to modify the YAML configuration files used by Grizzly. This could be achieved through:
    - Compromising the Git repository where the configuration files are stored.
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Grizzly application that allow for configuration injection.
    - Gaining unauthorized access to the storage where configuration files are deployed.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py`
  - Function: `run_query` and `load_data` methods of `GrizzlyOperator` class, and `create_view` method.
  - Code Flow:
    - The `GrizzlyOperator` is responsible for executing ETL tasks.
    - The `execute` method in `GrizzlyOperator` calls methods like `create_view`, `export_data`, `run_query`, `load_data` based on the `job_write_mode` defined in the YAML configuration.
    - These methods, in turn, call functions from `grizzly.etl_action` module, such as `grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query` and `grizzly.etl_action.create_view`.
    - In `grizzly/etl_action.py`, the `run_bq_query` function directly executes the SQL query using `execution_context.bq_cursor.run_query(sql=sql, ...)`.
    - The `sql` parameter in `run_bq_query` comes directly from the `stage_loading_query` parameter in the YAML configuration file without any sanitization or parameterization.
  - Visualization:
    ```
    YAML Config File (stage_loading_query) --> GrizzlyOperator.execute() -->
    (Based on job_write_mode) --> GrizzlyOperator.run_query() / GrizzlyOperator.create_view() / ... -->
    grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query() --> bq_cursor.run_query(sql=sql) --> BigQuery execution
    ```
  - Explanation:
    - The data flow clearly shows that the `stage_loading_query` from the YAML configuration is directly passed to the BigQuery execution engine without any intermediate security checks or sanitization. This creates a direct path for SQL injection if an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration files.

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Identify the configuration file: `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`.
  - Step 2: Modify the `stage_loading_query` in `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml` to inject a malicious SQL command. Replace the original query with:
    ```yaml
    stage_loading_query: "SELECT user_email() FROM `grizzly-dev.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`;"
    ```
  - Step 3: Deploy the modified configuration. This can be done by running the provided installation scripts, specifically `./tools/apply_grizzy_terraform.sh` for the `dev` environment, ensuring that the modified YAML file is included in the deployment.
  - Step 4: Trigger the Airflow DAG that executes the `prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat` task. This can be done through the Airflow UI or by triggering the DAG manually.
  - Step 5: Monitor the Airflow task logs for the `prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat` task. The logs should contain the output of the `SELECT user_email()` query, which in BigQuery returns the email of the user executing the query (in this case, the service account used by Airflow/Grizzly).
  - Step 6: Successful execution of `SELECT user_email()` (or similar information retrieval query) in the logs confirms the SQL injection vulnerability. A more impactful test could involve attempting to modify data, but retrieving user information is sufficient to demonstrate the vulnerability.
