## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in YAML Configuration Files

- **Description:**
  1. The Grizzly DataOps platform uses YAML configuration files to define data warehouse operations and ETL jobs.
  2. Within these YAML files, parameters like `stage_loading_query`, `job_data_quality_query`, `pre_etl_scripts`, and `post_etl_scripts` are used to define SQL queries that are executed against the BigQuery data warehouse. The `stage_loading_query` parameter, in particular, specifies the path to a `.sql` file or directly contains the SQL query to be executed during the data loading stage.
  3. An attacker with the ability to modify YAML configuration files (e.g., through a compromised Git repository, insecure access controls, or vulnerabilities in the platform itself) can inject malicious SQL code into these configuration parameters.
  4. When Grizzly processes these YAML configurations, it extracts the SQL queries and directly executes them against the BigQuery data warehouse without proper sanitization or parameterization.
  5. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and other security breaches within the BigQuery environment.

- **Impact:**
  - **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass intended data access controls and read sensitive data from the BigQuery data warehouse, including customer data, financial records, or intellectual property.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the data warehouse, leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, data loss, or financial loss.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the permissions of the service account used by Grizzly to interact with BigQuery, successful SQL injection could allow attackers to escalate privileges and perform administrative tasks within the BigQuery project or even the broader Google Cloud project.
  - **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate large volumes of data from the data warehouse to external locations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No mitigations are currently implemented in the provided project files to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code directly executes SQL queries defined in the YAML configuration files without any input validation, sanitization, or parameterized queries. The project relies on users to provide safe SQL code in the configuration files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all SQL queries read from YAML configuration files before execution. This should include all parameters that are used to define SQL queries, such as `stage_loading_query`, `job_data_quality_query`, `pre_etl_scripts`, and `post_etl_scripts`.
  - **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
  - **Least Privilege Principle:** Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user or service account used by Grizzly to interact with BigQuery. Limit the permissions of this account to the bare minimum required for the application to function, reducing the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack. Avoid granting overly permissive roles like `roles/bigquery.admin`.
  - **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement secure configuration management practices to protect YAML configuration files from unauthorized access and modification. This includes access controls, version control, and regular security audits.
  - **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the Grizzly platform, especially the parts that parse and execute SQL queries from configuration files, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - **Documentation and Security Guidelines:** Provide clear documentation and security guidelines to users, warning them about the risks of SQL injection and instructing them on how to write secure SQL configuration files and manage configurations securely.
  - **Static Analysis Tools:** Consider implementing static analysis tools to automatically scan YAML and SQL configurations for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development and deployment.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. **Access to Configuration Files:** The attacker must have the ability to modify the YAML configuration files used by Grizzly. This could be achieved through:
     - Compromising the Git repository where the configuration files are stored.
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Grizzly application that allow for configuration injection.
     - Gaining unauthorized access to the storage location (e.g., Cloud Storage bucket) where configuration files are deployed.
     - Gaining unauthorized access to the environment where configurations are managed.
  2. **Grizzly Deployment:** The Grizzly platform must be deployed and configured to execute ETL jobs and data operations based on these modified YAML configuration files.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. **File:** `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py`
  2. **Function:** `run_query`, `load_data`, and `create_view` methods of `GrizzlyOperator` class within `/code/airflow/plugins/operators/grizzly_operator.py`, and functions in `grizzly.etl_action.py` such as `run_bq_query` and `create_view`.
  3. **Code Flow:**
     - The `GrizzlyOperator` is responsible for executing ETL tasks within Airflow DAGs.
     - The `execute` method in `GrizzlyOperator` dispatches calls to different methods like `create_view`, `export_data`, `run_query`, `load_data`, or `merge_data` based on the `job_write_mode` defined in the YAML configuration.
     - These methods, in turn, often call functions from the `grizzly.etl_action` module, such as `grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query` and `grizzly.etl_action.create_view`.
     - In `grizzly/etl_action.py`, the `run_bq_query` function directly executes the SQL query using `execution_context.bq_cursor.run_query(sql=sql, ...)`.
     - The crucial point is that the `sql` parameter in `run_bq_query` (and similarly in other SQL execution paths) is directly derived from configuration parameters in the YAML files, such as `stage_loading_query`, without any sanitization or parameterization.
  4. **Visualization:**

     ```mermaid
     graph LR
         YAML_Config[YAML Configuration File (e.g., stage_loading_query)] --> GrizzlyOperator.execute()
         GrizzlyOperator.execute() --> GrizzlyOperator.run_query() / GrizzlyOperator.create_view() / ...
         GrizzlyOperator.run_query() --> grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query(sql=sql)
         grizzly.etl_action.run_bq_query(sql=sql) --> bq_cursor.run_query(sql=sql)
         bq_cursor.run_query(sql=sql) --> BigQuery[BigQuery Data Warehouse]
     ```

     - This visualization highlights the direct flow of the `stage_loading_query` from the YAML configuration to the BigQuery execution engine, demonstrating the lack of any security checks or sanitization in between, which creates a direct path for SQL injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Precondition:** Assume an attacker has gained write access to the Git repository containing Grizzly configuration files.
  2. **Step 1: Identify a YAML configuration file** that defines a `stage_loading_query` or similar SQL execution parameter. For example, `/code/grizzly_example/geo_australia/prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat.yml`.
  3. **Step 2: Modify the YAML file** to inject malicious SQL code directly into the `stage_loading_query` parameter. Replace the original `stage_loading_query` with a malicious SQL command. For example:

     ```yaml
     target_table_name: prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat
     job_write_mode: WRITE_TRUNCATE
     stage_loading_query: "SELECT user_email() FROM `grizzly-dev.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`;"
     ```
     Or to demonstrate data manipulation:
     ```yaml
     target_table_name: prs_geo_australia.income_elderly_stat
     job_write_mode: WRITE_TRUNCATE
     stage_loading_query: "CREATE TABLE malicious_table AS SELECT * FROM bas_geo_australia.tax_income_average_median_by_postcode; SELECT 1;"
     ```
  4. **Step 3: Commit and push the changes** to the Git repository, or deploy the modified configuration to the Grizzly environment through other means if direct file access is possible.
  5. **Step 4: Trigger the Grizzly ETL job** that uses the modified configuration. This can be done by triggering the relevant Airflow DAG through the Airflow UI, Cloud Build trigger, or manually.
  6. **Step 5: Verify the vulnerability:**
     - **For information retrieval:** Monitor the Airflow task logs for the executed task. The logs should contain the output of the injected `SELECT user_email()` query, revealing the email of the service account used by Grizzly, confirming code execution.
     - **For data manipulation:** Check BigQuery to see if the `malicious_table` has been created, or if other data manipulation actions (like dropping a table as in another example) were successful. If the injected SQL code is executed and has the intended malicious impact, the SQL injection vulnerability is confirmed.

### Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive Outbound Data Export Configurations

- **Description:**
  1. Grizzly provides functionality to export data from BigQuery to Cloud Storage using YAML configurations. This is configured using `job_write_mode: EXPORT_DATA` in YAML files, as seen in examples like `/code/grizzly_example/base/bas_austin_crime_with_date/bas_austin_crime_with_date.export_to_gs.yml` and `/code/grizzly_example/store_research/prs_store_research.locations.outbound.yml`.
  2. These YAML files specify the data to be exported using `stage_loading_query` and define the destination Cloud Storage bucket and path.
  3. If these export configurations are not carefully reviewed and secured, they could be misconfigured in a way that sensitive data is exported to a publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket or a bucket with insufficient access controls.
  4. An attacker who gains write access to the Git repository containing these YAML files could modify the export configurations. They could change the `stage_loading_query` to select sensitive data for export and/or modify the export destination to a location they control or to a publicly accessible bucket, leading to unauthorized data exfiltration.

- **Impact:**
  - **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Misconfigured outbound data export configurations can lead to the inadvertent or malicious exposure of sensitive data if exported data ends up in insecure or unintended locations, such as publicly accessible Cloud Storage buckets. This can result in privacy breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project relies on user-defined YAML configurations for data export. There are no automated checks or safeguards evident in the provided files to prevent overly permissive or insecure export configurations. The security of data exports is solely dependent on the user correctly configuring the YAML files and managing access controls on the destination Cloud Storage buckets.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Validation Checks for Export Destinations:** Implement validation checks on outbound data export configurations to ensure that exported data is not inadvertently exposed to public or unauthorized locations. This could include checks against a whitelist of approved destination buckets or automated security policy enforcement.
  - **Secure Configuration Guidelines and Documentation:** Provide comprehensive secure configuration guidelines and documentation to users on how to securely configure data exports. Emphasize the importance of access controls on destination Cloud Storage buckets, the need to carefully review the data selected for export in `stage_loading_query`, and best practices for securing export configurations.
  - **Automated Policy Enforcement and Review Processes:** Consider implementing automated checks or policy enforcement to prevent exports to public buckets or exports that have not been reviewed and approved, especially for sensitive datasets. Implement a review and approval workflow for data export configurations, particularly those involving sensitive data.
  - **Least Privilege for Export Operations:** Ensure that the service accounts or roles used by Grizzly for data export operations adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions to read from BigQuery and write to the intended Cloud Storage buckets.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. **Access to Configuration Files:** An attacker needs to be able to modify the YAML configuration files within the Git repository, specifically those defining data export jobs (e.g., files with `job_write_mode: EXPORT_DATA` or `*.outbound.yml`).
  2. **Grizzly Deployment:** The Grizzly deployment must be configured to execute these export jobs based on the modified YAML configurations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The provided files do not contain the core logic that processes the `EXPORT_DATA` job_write_mode and executes the data export operation. To fully analyze this vulnerability, the code that handles data export configurations (likely within the `grizzly` Python package, specifically in modules related to data exporting, not provided here) would need to be reviewed.
  - Based on the project description and the presence of data export configurations in YAML files, the vulnerability is theoretical and stems from potential misconfigurations rather than a direct code flaw within the provided snippets. The risk lies in the lack of security checks and user guidance around configuring data exports securely.
  - The relevant configurations are in YAML files like `/code/grizzly_example/base/bas_austin_crime_with_date/bas_austin_crime_with_date.export_to_gs.yml` which define the export job and destination.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Precondition:** Assume an attacker has gained write access to the Git repository containing Grizzly configuration files.
  2. **Step 1: Identify a YAML file** that defines a data export job (e.g., `*.outbound.yml` or one with `job_write_mode: EXPORT_DATA`). For example, `/code/grizzly_example/store_research/prs_store_research.locations.outbound.yml`.
  3. **Step 2: Modify the YAML file** to change the export configuration to exfiltrate sensitive data to an insecure location.
     - **Modify `stage_loading_query`:** Change it to select sensitive data from a BigQuery table. In a test environment, this could be data that is meant to be private or internal.
     - **Modify export destination:** Change the `destination_file_uri` or related parameters to point to a Cloud Storage bucket that is publicly accessible or to a bucket that the attacker controls.
     For example, modify `/code/grizzly_example/store_research/prs_store_research.locations.outbound.yml` to change the `destination_file_uri` to a publicly writable bucket and modify `stage_loading_query` to select sensitive data if the original query was not selecting sensitive data.
  4. **Step 3: Commit and push the changes** to the Git repository, or deploy the modified configuration to the Grizzly environment.
  5. **Step 4: Trigger the Grizzly ETL job** that uses the modified export configuration.
  6. **Step 5: Verify the vulnerability:** Check the Cloud Storage bucket specified as the modified export destination. If the sensitive data from BigQuery is successfully exported to the bucket and is accessible to unauthorized users (e.g., if exported to a public bucket), the vulnerability is confirmed. Also, verify if the data exported is indeed the sensitive data intended for exfiltration based on the modified `stage_loading_query`.
