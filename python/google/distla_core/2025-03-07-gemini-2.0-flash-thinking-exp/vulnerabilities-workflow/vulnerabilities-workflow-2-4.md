## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Buffer Overflow in Matrix Data Processing via Unvalidated Dimensions

- Description:
  1. The `tp run` command executes Python scripts (e.g., `launch_distla_core.py`) on ASIC VMs to perform distributed linear algebra computations using the Distla library.
  2. These scripts read matrix data from files specified by user-controlled paths (e.g., `obj_fn_path`, `ovlp_path`, `dm_path`) passed as command-line arguments.
  3. The matrix dimensions are read from the STRUCPACK files using the `read_matrix` function in `/code/distla/struc_pack/single-host/struc_pack_wrapper.py`.
  4. There is no explicit validation of matrix dimensions within the Python scripts (`launch_distla_core.py`, `launch_distla_numpy.py`, `launch_distla_ctest.py`) before passing them to linear algebra functions in `distla_core` or the underlying C++ STRUCPACK library.
  5. A malicious attacker can craft a STRUCPACK file with matrix data where the dimensions specified in the header are inconsistent with the actual data, or excessively large, or negative.
  6. When `read_matrix` in `struc_pack_wrapper.py` reads the dimensions, and the C++ STRUCPACK library allocates buffers based on these dimensions, a subsequent read of matrix data exceeding the allocated buffer size will cause a buffer overflow.
  7. This buffer overflow can potentially overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to arbitrary code execution on the ASIC VM instance.

- Impact:
  - Critical
  - Arbitrary code execution on the ASIC VM instance.
  - Potential data breach or system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None identified in the provided project files. The code relies on external STRUCPACK library and does not seem to implement any input validation for matrix dimensions or sizes before processing.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation in Python scripts (`launch_distla_core.py`, `launch_distla_numpy.py`, `launch_distla_ctest.py`) to check matrix dimensions read from STRUCPACK files.
  - Bounds checking within the C++ STRUCPACK library itself to prevent buffer overflows when reading matrix data.
  - Input sanitization to prevent unexpected characters or data types in matrix dimensions.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to provide maliciously crafted STRUCPACK matrix files to the Distla library. This could be achieved by:
    - Modifying input files used by the Distla library if the attacker has write access to the system.
    - Sending malicious data through an external interface if the Distla library is exposed as a service and accepts matrix data as input. Based on the project description, sending maliciously crafted matrix data as input to the library functions is a plausible attack vector.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/distla/struc_pack/single-host/struc_pack_wrapper.py`**
    - Function: `read_matrix(self, path, format_sparse=True)`
      ```python
      def read_matrix(self, path, format_sparse=True):
        ...
        n_basis = ctypes.c_int(0)
        n_elec = ctypes.c_double(0.0)
        n_lrow = ctypes.c_int(0)
        n_lcol = ctypes.c_int(0)
        path_buffer = path.encode('ASCII')

        self._libstruc_pack.c_struc_pack_init_rw( # Native call to initialize STRUCPACK
          byref(self.rh), r_task, para_mode, n_basis, n_elec)
        self._libstruc_pack.c_struc_pack_read_mat_dim( # Native call to read matrix dimensions
          self.rh, path_buffer, byref(n_elec), byref(n_basis), byref(n_lrow),
          byref(n_lcol))
        matrix = np.zeros([n_basis.value, n_basis.value], dtype='double') # Allocate matrix buffer based on n_basis.value

        pointer_to_matrix = matrix.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_double))
        if format_sparse:
          self._libstruc_pack.c_struc_pack_read_mat_real(self.rh, path_buffer, # Native call to read matrix data
                                            pointer_to_matrix)
        else:
          self._libstruc_pack.c_struc_pack_read_dense_matrix_real(
            self.rh, path_buffer, pointer_to_matrix)
        ...
        return matrix, n_elec.value
      ```
      - The `read_matrix` function uses ctypes to call native functions from `libstruc_pack.so`.
      - `c_struc_pack_read_mat_dim` reads matrix dimensions (n_basis, n_lrow, n_lcol) from the file header into ctypes integer variables.
      - `matrix = np.zeros([n_basis.value, n_basis.value], dtype='double')` allocates a NumPy array buffer using `n_basis.value` for both dimensions.
      - `c_struc_pack_read_mat_real` or `c_struc_pack_read_dense_matrix_real` reads the actual matrix data from the file and writes it into the allocated `matrix` buffer via `pointer_to_matrix`.
      - **Vulnerability:** If a malicious STRUCPACK file provides a large `n_basis` value in the header, but the actual data in the file is larger than what is expected for a `n_basis x n_basis` matrix, the native `c_struc_pack_read_mat_real` or `c_struc_pack_read_dense_matrix_real` function in the C++ STRUCPACK library could write beyond the allocated buffer, causing a buffer overflow. The Python wrapper does not perform any validation to ensure that the data read from the file is consistent with the dimensions read from the header or that the dimensions are within safe limits.

  - **File: `/code/distla/struc_pack/launch_distla_ctest.py` & `/code/distla/struc_pack/launch_distla_numpy.py` & `/code/distla/struc_pack/multi-host/launch_distla.py` & `/code/distla/struc_pack/single-host/launch_distla.py`**
    - These scripts take file paths as command line arguments and pass them to `struc_pack.read_matrix()`.
    - No validation is performed on the dimensions read from the STRUCPACK files within these python scripts before processing the matrix data.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prepare Malicious STRUCPACK File:**
     - Create a STRUCPACK file (e.g., `malicious_matrix.csc`) with a header specifying a small matrix dimension (e.g., `n_basis = 10`), but embed significantly more matrix data in the file content (e.g., data for a `1000x1000` matrix).
  2. **Run Distla Script with Malicious File:**
     - Execute the `tp run` command with a configuration (e.g., `asic.yaml`) that runs `launch_distla_core.py` (or any other `launch_distla*.py` script).
     - Pass the path to the `malicious_matrix.csc` file as an argument to the script, replacing a legitimate matrix data file path. For example:
       ```bash
       tp run malicious_matrix.csc ovlp.tmp dm.tmp ebs.tmp --name 'my-asic' --entry_point 'launch_distla_core.py'
       ```
       Here, `malicious_matrix.csc` is passed as `obj_fn_path` (first argument).
  3. **Observe System Behavior:**
     - Monitor the ASIC VM instance for crashes, unexpected behavior, or signs of code execution outside the intended program flow. A successful exploit may lead to a crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution, which is harder to detect from outside.
     - Check system logs (`/tmp/asic_logs` on the ASIC VM) for error messages related to memory access violations or buffer overflows within the STRUCPACK library or Distla core components.
  4. **Expected Outcome:**
     - The ASIC VM instance may crash or exhibit unexpected behavior due to the buffer overflow.
     - System logs may contain error messages indicating memory corruption.
     - If the attacker successfully gains code execution, further malicious actions on the VM instance are possible.

This vulnerability allows for a critical security breach by potentially achieving arbitrary code execution through maliciously crafted input data. It needs immediate attention and mitigation.
