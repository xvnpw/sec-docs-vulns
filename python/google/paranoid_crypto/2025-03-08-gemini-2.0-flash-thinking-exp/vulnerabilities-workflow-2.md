## Vulnerability Report

The following vulnerabilities were identified and require attention to improve the security posture of the Paranoid Crypto library.

### Insecure Deserialization or Processing of Malicious Protobuf Messages

- Description:
    - Paranoid uses protobuf messages to represent cryptographic artifacts.
    - If Paranoid directly deserializes protobuf messages from untrusted sources, there is a risk of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - A malicious attacker could craft a specially crafted protobuf message that exploits vulnerabilities in the protobuf deserialization process or in the code that processes the deserialized message.
    - These vulnerabilities could include buffer overflows, type confusion, and logic vulnerabilities.
- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (potentially, if deserialization leads to memory corruption).
    - Denial of Service (DoS) due to crashes or resource exhaustion.
    - Information Disclosure, potentially allowing access to internal program state or memory.
- Vulnerability Rank: High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Protobuf is used, which is generally a secure serialization format. However, incorrect usage or flaws in processing logic could introduce vulnerabilities.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation after deserialization:** Implement thorough validation of deserialized protobuf messages to check for expected structure, field types, and value ranges.
    - **Secure deserialization practices:** Ensure secure deserialization practices are followed when handling protobuf messages from untrusted sources.
    - **Sandboxing or isolation:** Consider running protobuf deserialization and processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - Paranoid processes protobuf messages provided or influenced by an attacker (e.g., via file input or network communication).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Examine code sections where `paranoid_pb2` messages are deserialized using functions like `FromString()` or `ParseFromString()`.
    - Analyze the processing of deserialized messages in subsequent checks and algorithms for potential vulnerabilities triggered by malicious protobuf structures or field values.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious protobuf message (e.g., `paranoid_pb2.RSAKey`, `paranoid_pb2.ECDSASignature`) with deeply nested messages, extreme field values, or manipulated optional/repeated fields.
    2. Modify example scripts to load and process this crafted protobuf message.
    3. Run Paranoid checks with the malicious protobuf.
    4. Observe if the program crashes, produces incorrect results, exhausts resources, or exhibits other unexpected behavior.
    5. Analyze logs and use debugging tools to investigate any issues indicating a deserialization or processing vulnerability.

### Sensitive Data Logging

- Description:
    - Paranoid Crypto library uses `absl.logging` to record details during cryptographic artifact analysis.
    - This logging might inadvertently include sensitive cryptographic artifacts or intermediate calculations.
    - If logs are accessible to unauthorized parties in insecure environments, attackers could retrieve sensitive cryptographic information.
- Impact:
    - Exposure of sensitive cryptographic keys or related cryptographic data.
    - Compromise of cryptographic systems relying on these keys, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project uses `absl.logging` without explicit mitigations against logging sensitive data.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Implement secure logging practices:** Sanitize or redact sensitive data before logging, or avoid logging sensitive data directly.
    - **Provide clear documentation and warnings:** Warn users about the risks of using the library with sensitive data in insecure environments and potential log exposure.
    - **Implement configurable logging:** Allow users to disable or fine-tune logging, especially when processing sensitive data, with options to control logging levels and information types.
- Preconditions:
    1. User executes Paranoid Crypto checks on sensitive cryptographic artifacts (private keys, sensitive public keys, signatures).
    2. Logging is enabled in Paranoid Crypto.
    3. The execution environment is insecure, allowing attacker access to logs (file system, console output).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Review example files and core library code (`paranoid.py`, `randomness_tests/random_test_suite.py`) for `absl.logging` usage.
    - Check if sensitive data (input cryptographic artifacts or derived values) is logged using `absl.logging.info`, `absl.logging.debug`, etc.
    - If sensitive data is logged without sanitization when log level is greater than 0, the vulnerability is present.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Install `paranoid_crypto`, create a log directory, create a dummy RSA private key, and extract public key components to `test_key.pem`. Modify `examples/rsa_public_keys.py` to load public key parameters from `test_key.pem`.
    2. Execution: Run the modified `examples/rsa_public_keys.py` script with logging enabled and directed to the log directory (e.g., `python3 examples/rsa_public_keys.py --log_dir=test_logs`). Consider using a debug log level if available.
    3. Analysis: Examine the generated log file in the `test_logs` directory. Search for RSA public key components (n, e) from `test_key.pem` or any other sensitive data.
    4. If RSA public key components or sensitive cryptographic information are found in the log file, the Sensitive Data Logging vulnerability is confirmed.
