- Vulnerability name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `lf.Image.from_uri`

- Description:
  An attacker can exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability by providing a malicious URL to the `lf.Image.from_uri` function. This function, intended to load images from provided URIs, might not be performing adequate validation of the input URL. By crafting a URL that points to internal resources or external services, an attacker could potentially make the server initiate requests to unintended destinations.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1. Identify an application or service that uses the Langfun library and incorporates user-provided URLs into the `lf.Image.from_uri` function.
  2. As an attacker, craft a malicious URL. This URL could target:
      - Internal network resources (e.g., `http://internal.example.com/admin`).
      - Cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`).
      - External services that the attacker wants to interact with through the server.
  3. Provide this malicious URL as input to the application, specifically targeting the functionality that uses `lf.Image.from_uri`.
  4. Observe the server-side behavior. If the application is vulnerable, the server will make a request to the attacker-specified URL.
  5. Depending on the targeted URL and the application's network configuration, the attacker may be able to:
      - Access sensitive information from internal resources.
      - Interact with internal services that are not meant to be publicly accessible.
      - Use the server as a proxy to access external services, potentially bypassing access controls or gaining anonymity.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this SSRF vulnerability could lead to:
  - **Confidentiality breach**: Access to sensitive internal data or resources not intended for public access.
  - **Integrity violation**: Modification of internal data if the attacker can reach internal services with write access.
  - **Availability disruption**: Overloading internal services or external services, potentially leading to denial of service.
  - **Security bypass**: Circumvention of firewalls, network segmentation, or other security controls by routing requests through the vulnerable server.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - No mitigations are explicitly mentioned in the provided project files. Based on the code analysis below, there is no evidence of URL validation or sanitization for `lf.Image.from_uri`.

- Missing mitigations:
  - **URL validation**: Implement robust URL validation to ensure that the provided URI adheres to a safe list of protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`) and does not target internal or restricted networks.
  - **Input sanitization**: Sanitize user-provided URLs to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or URL components.
  - **Blocklist for sensitive hosts**: Implement a blocklist to prevent requests to internal networks, private IP ranges, and sensitive cloud metadata endpoints.
  - **Network segmentation**: Isolate the application server from internal resources to limit the impact of SSRF exploitation.
  - **Least privilege principle**: Ensure that the application server operates with the minimum necessary privileges to access internal resources.

- Preconditions:
  - An application or service must be using the Langfun library.
  - The application must use the `lf.Image.from_uri` function to load images based on user-provided URLs.
  - There must be no proper validation or sanitization of the user-provided URLs before being used in `lf.Image.from_uri`.

- Source code analysis:
  - Based on the `README.md` example, the code snippet `lf.Image.from_uri('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Solar_system.jpg/1646px-Solar_system.jpg')` shows the usage of `lf.Image.from_uri`.
  - Assuming the implementation of `lf.Image.from_uri` in `langfun/core/modalities.py` (not provided) directly uses the input URI to fetch image data, without any validation, the vulnerability arises.
  - The vulnerability is triggered because the Langfun library itself (based on provided files) doesn't include URL validation or sanitization within the `lf.Image.from_uri` implementation.
  - The risk is that a developer using Langfun might unknowingly introduce an SSRF vulnerability by directly using user-supplied URLs with `lf.Image.from_uri` without adding their own security checks.

- Security test case:
  1. Set up a simple application that uses Langfun and exposes a functionality to load and display images using `lf.Image.from_uri` with a user-supplied URL parameter (e.g., through a web form or API endpoint).
  2. As an attacker, use a tool like `curl` or a web browser to send a request to the application, providing a malicious URL as the image source. For example:
     `https://<vulnerable-application>/display_image?image_url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id` (for AWS metadata).
  3. Monitor the network traffic from the server hosting the Langfun application.
  4. If the application is vulnerable to SSRF, you will observe the server making an outbound HTTP request to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id`.
  5. Examine the application's response. If the application returns data from the metadata endpoint (e.g., instance ID), it confirms the SSRF vulnerability.
  6. For further testing, try URLs targeting internal services or other external services to assess the full extent of the SSRF vulnerability.
