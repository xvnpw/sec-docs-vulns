### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Configuration

- Description:
    - The application uses a configuration file to define commands that are executed by the system.
    - The `_get_command_line` function in `software/two_button.py` and `software/lockbox.py` constructs command lines from configuration values using `shlex.split` and string formatting.
    - Specifically, the configuration options such as `auth.command`, `auth.extend_command`, `auth.deauth_command`, and `sounds.command` are vulnerable.
    - An attacker who can modify the configuration file (e.g., by compromising the Raspberry Pi or through other means if configuration is externally managed) can inject arbitrary commands into these configuration values.
    - When the application executes these commands (e.g., during badge scan or button press), the injected commands will be executed by the system.
    - For example, if the `auth.command` is set to `/bin/echo 'User: {}' && malicious_command`, and the badge ID is scanned, the `malicious_command` will be executed in addition to the intended `echo` command.

- Impact:
    - **High/Critical**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Raspberry Pi running the authbox software.
    - This can lead to full system compromise, including:
        - Unauthorized access to the tool controlled by the authbox.
        - Data exfiltration from the Raspberry Pi.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Denial of service by crashing the system or disrupting operations.
        - Privilege escalation if the authbox software is running with elevated privileges (though the provided systemd service example runs as user `pi`).

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None**: The code does not implement any specific mitigations against command injection in the `_get_command_line` function or when handling configuration values that are used to construct commands.
    - The use of `shlex.split` is intended for safer command line parsing, but it does not prevent command injection if the configuration values themselves are malicious.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The application should validate and sanitize configuration values, especially those used to construct commands.  Restrict allowed characters and command structures in configuration.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure the authbox software runs with the minimum necessary privileges. The provided systemd script runs as user `pi`, which is a good starting point, but further privilege reduction might be possible.
    - **Configuration File Protection**: Secure the configuration file (`.authboxrc`) to prevent unauthorized modifications. File system permissions should restrict write access to only the administrative user.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: Consider running the command execution in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of successful command injection.
    - **Code Review**: Thoroughly review all code paths that involve command execution, especially those that use configuration values as part of the command.

- Preconditions:
    - **Configuration File Modification**: An attacker must be able to modify the configuration file (`.authboxrc`). This could be achieved through:
        - Direct access to the Raspberry Pi's file system (e.g., via SSH if enabled with default credentials, physical access, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access).
        - If the configuration is managed remotely, compromising the remote management system.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `software/two_button.py` and `software/lockbox.py`**
    - Function: `_get_command_line(self, section, key, format_args)`

    ```python
    def _get_command_line(self, section, key, format_args):
        value = self.config.get(section, key) # [1] Retrieve configuration value
        pieces = shlex.split(value)          # [2] Split into arguments
        return [p.format(*format_args) for p in pieces] # [3] Format each piece
    ```
    - **Step 1**: `value = self.config.get(section, key)` retrieves the command string from the configuration file based on the `section` and `key` provided (e.g., `auth.command`).
    - **Step 2**: `pieces = shlex.split(value)` uses `shlex.split` to parse the command string into a list of arguments. While `shlex.split` helps to handle quoting and escaping, it doesn't prevent injection if the entire `value` is maliciously crafted.
    - **Step 3**: `return [p.format(*format_args) for p in pieces]` iterates through the parsed pieces and applies string formatting using `format_args`. In the context of `badge_scan`, `format_args` is `[badge_id]`.
    - **Vulnerability**: If the configuration value retrieved in **Step 1** is attacker-controlled and contains malicious commands or format specifiers, and if the scripts called by `auth.command` are also vulnerable to command injection, then arbitrary commands can be executed. Even if scripts are safe, malicious commands can be directly embedded in the configuration value itself.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Pre-Test Setup**:
        - Assume a Raspberry Pi is running the `two_button.py` script.
        - Access the Raspberry Pi's filesystem (e.g., via SSH or directly if possible for testing purposes).
        - Locate the configuration file, typically `~/.authboxrc`.
    - **Step 1**: Modify the configuration file (`~/.authboxrc`) and change the `auth.command` value in the `[auth]` section to include a malicious command. For example:
        ```ini
        [auth]
        command = /bin/touch /tmp/pwned_{}
        duration = 20s
        warning = 10s
        extend = 20s
        deauth_command = rm -f enabled
        ```
    - **Step 2**: Scan any RFID badge using the badge reader connected to the Raspberry Pi.
    - **Step 3**: Check if the malicious command was executed. In this example, check if a file named `pwned_<badge_id>` (where `<badge_id>` is the scanned badge ID) was created in the `/tmp/` directory on the Raspberry Pi.
    - **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned_<badge_id>` will be created, indicating successful command injection.
    - **Cleanup**: Remove the modified `auth.command` from the configuration file and delete the created test file `/tmp/pwned_<badge_id>`.

This test case demonstrates that by modifying the configuration file, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands when a badge is scanned, confirming the Command Injection vulnerability.
