- **Vulnerability Name:** RFID Badge Replay Attack

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker with a simple RFID reader (easily obtainable online) can passively eavesdrop and record the RFID signals transmitted by legitimate users' badges when they authenticate with the system.
  2. The attacker can then replay these recorded signals to the RFID reader connected to the access control system at a later time.
  3. The system, upon receiving the replayed RFID signal, processes it as if it were from a legitimate user.
  4. If the replayed badge ID corresponds to an authorized user, the system grants unauthorized access to the controlled tool or resource.

- **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized access to tools and resources controlled by the RFID access control system.
  - Circumvention of intended access control policies, potentially leading to misuse, damage, or theft of equipment.
  - Compromise of safety measures if access to dangerous tools is granted to untrained or unauthorized individuals.
  - Loss of accountability and audit trails, as unauthorized access may be logged under a legitimate user's identity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. Based on the provided project files, there are no explicit mitigations implemented to prevent RFID badge replay attacks. The system relies on simple badge ID checks without any cryptographic protection or dynamic elements to prevent replay attacks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Mutual Authentication:** Implement a mutual authentication protocol between the RFID badge and the reader. This would involve cryptographic challenge-response mechanisms to verify the authenticity of both the badge and the reader in each transaction, preventing replay attacks.
  - **Encryption:** Encrypt the communication between the RFID badge and reader. This would make it harder for attackers to eavesdrop and understand the transmitted data, although encryption alone might not prevent replay attacks if the encryption scheme is static or predictable.
  - **Rolling Codes/One-Time Passwords:** Utilize RFID badges that generate rolling codes or one-time passwords for each authentication attempt. This would invalidate previously captured signals, rendering replay attacks ineffective.
  - **Time-based Tokens:** Implement time-based tokens or session identifiers that are validated by the access control system. These tokens would expire after a short period, limiting the window of opportunity for replay attacks.
  - **Anomaly Detection:** Implement monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual access patterns, such as multiple access attempts from the same badge ID within a short timeframe from geographically distant locations, which could indicate a replay attack.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. An attacker must be within the reading range of the RFID badge reader when a legitimate user authenticates.
  2. The attacker must possess an RFID reader capable of capturing and replaying RFID signals (easily and cheaply available).
  3. The attacker must target a badge ID that belongs to an authorized user for the specific tool or resource they wish to access.

- **Source Code Analysis:**

  1. **Badge Reading:** The project uses `HIDKeystrokingReader` (`software/authbox/badgereader_hid_keystroking.py`) or `WiegandGPIOReader` (`software/authbox/badgereader_wiegand_gpio.py`) to read badge IDs. These readers, as implemented, simply capture and transmit the static badge ID.
  ```python
  # software/authbox/badgereader_hid_keystroking.py - Extracts badge ID as keystrokes
  class HIDKeystrokingReader(BaseDerivedThread):
      # ...
      def read_input(self):
          rfid = ""
          # ...
          for event in device.read_loop():
              # ... extracts characters and appends to rfid string
          return rfid

  # software/authbox/badgereader_wiegand_gpio.py - Reads badge ID bits from GPIO pins
  class WiegandGPIOReader(BaseWiegandPinThread):
      # ...
      def read_input(self):
          # ... reads bits from GPIO and constructs badge id string
          return "".join(bits)
  ```
  Neither of these readers implements any security measures to prevent signal cloning or replay. They are designed to simply read and pass on the static badge ID.

  2. **Authentication Scripts:** The core logic relies on external scripts (e.g., `sample_auth_check.sh`, `sample_extend.sh`, `sample_deauth.sh`) configured in the `.authboxrc` file.  The `two_button.py` and `lockbox.py` scripts use `_get_command_line` to execute these scripts.
  ```python
  # software/two_button.py and software/lockbox.py - Command execution
  class Dispatcher(BaseDispatcher):
      # ...
      def _get_command_line(self, section, key, format_args):
          value = self.config.get(section, key)
          pieces = shlex.split(value)
          return [p.format(*format_args) for p in pieces]

      def badge_scan(self, badge_id):
          command = self._get_command_line('auth', 'command', [badge_id]) # Constructs command from config
          rc = subprocess.call(command) # Executes the command
          # ...
  ```
  The `sample_auth_check.sh` script performs a very basic check by grepping for the badge ID in a local `authorized.txt` file.
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # software/sample_auth_check.sh
  # ...
  user=$1 # badge id is passed as the first argument
  # ...
  grep -qw "$user" authorized.txt # simple check if badge id exists in authorized.txt
  ```
  These sample scripts lack any mechanism to verify the freshness or authenticity of the RFID signal. They simply check if the provided badge ID is authorized, making them vulnerable to replay attacks.

  3. **Configuration:** The configuration files (`.authboxrc`, example `SAMPLE_CONFIG` in `test_two_button.py`) define the hardware components and authentication commands.  There are no configuration options related to security measures against replay attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**

  1. **Setup:**
     a. Set up the Makerspace Auth system using the provided code, including a functional RFID reader and a tool controlled by a relay.
     b. Configure the system with `sample_auth_check.sh` and an `authorized.txt` file containing at least one authorized badge ID.
     c. Have a legitimate user with an authorized RFID badge.
     d. Prepare an RFID signal capturing and replaying tool (e.g., Proxmark3, or a simple RFID cloner/reader capable of replay).

  2. **Capture Legitimate Badge Signal:**
     a. Position the attacker's RFID reader near the Makerspace Auth system's RFID reader.
     b. Have the legitimate user present their authorized RFID badge to the system's reader to gain access (perform a normal authorized access).
     c. Simultaneously, use the attacker's RFID reader to capture and record the RFID signal transmitted by the legitimate user's badge during this authentication process.

  3. **Replay Attack:**
     a. After the legitimate user has finished and access is no longer needed, have the attacker approach the Makerspace Auth system with their RFID replay tool.
     b. Use the replay tool to transmit the previously recorded RFID signal to the system's RFID reader.
     c. Observe if the Makerspace Auth system grants access to the controlled tool upon receiving the replayed signal, even though it is not from the legitimate user's badge at the present time.

  4. **Verification:**
     a. If the system grants access after replaying the captured RFID signal, this confirms the RFID badge replay vulnerability. The attacker has successfully bypassed the intended access control by replaying a previously captured legitimate signal.
     b. Verify that the access logs, if implemented, show the unauthorized access attempt as being associated with the legitimate user's badge ID, further highlighting the impact of the replay attack.
