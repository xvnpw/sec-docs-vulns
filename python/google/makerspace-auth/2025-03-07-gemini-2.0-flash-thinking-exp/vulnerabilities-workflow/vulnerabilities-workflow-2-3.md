- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Badge ID in Shell Script Execution
- Description:
    1. The Python scripts `lockbox.py` and `two_button.py` use the `_get_command_line` method to construct shell commands from configuration parameters like `auth.command`, `auth.extend_command`, and `auth.deauth_command`.
    2. The `_get_command_line` method uses `shlex.split` to parse the command string from the configuration.
    3. The badge ID, obtained from the badge reader, is directly passed as an argument to the shell command using string formatting (`p.format(*format_args)`).
    4. If a malicious badge ID containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `$()`, `` ` ``) is scanned, these characters will be passed to the shell command without proper sanitization.
    5. When `subprocess.call(command)` is executed, the shell will interpret these metacharacters, leading to command injection.
    6. An attacker can craft a badge ID that, when scanned and processed by the system, executes arbitrary shell commands on the Raspberry Pi.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Raspberry Pi client.
    - This can lead to unauthorized access to the tool, bypassing the intended authorization mechanism.
    - The attacker could potentially escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or disrupt the system's operation.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses `shlex.split` for parsing the command, which is intended for safe command-line argument parsing, but it does not sanitize the badge ID input itself before formatting it into the command.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the badge ID in the Python scripts before passing it to the shell command.
    - Use parameterized queries or similar safe mechanisms when constructing shell commands to prevent injection. Instead of string formatting, consider using `subprocess.Popen` with a list of arguments where the badge ID is passed as a separate argument, which is generally safer as `subprocess` handles escaping.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to present a crafted badge to the RFID reader.
    - The system must be configured to use shell scripts for authorization (`auth.command`, etc.). This is the default configuration with `sample_auth_check.sh` in the example.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/software/two_button.py` (and `/code/software/lockbox.py`)**
    2. **Function: `_get_command_line(self, section, key, format_args)`**
    ```python
    def _get_command_line(self, section, key, format_args):
        """Constructs a command line, safely.

        ...
        """
        value = self.config.get(section, key)
        pieces = shlex.split(value)
        return [p.format(*format_args) for p in pieces]
    ```
    - The code retrieves the command string from the config file using `self.config.get(section, key)`.
    - It uses `shlex.split(value)` to split the command string into a list of arguments. `shlex.split` is designed to safely split command lines into arguments, respecting quotes and escapes, but it does not sanitize the *content* of the arguments themselves.
    - `return [p.format(*format_args) for p in pieces]` : This line formats each piece of the command with the provided `format_args`. In `badge_scan`, `format_args` is `[badge_id]`. This is where the unsanitized badge ID is inserted into the command.

    3. **Function: `badge_scan(self, badge_id)`**
    ```python
    def badge_scan(self, badge_id):
        # Malicious badge "numbers" that contain spaces require this extra work.
        command = self._get_command_line('auth', 'command', [badge_id])
        # TODO timeout
        # TODO test with missing command
        rc = subprocess.call(command)
        ...
    ```
    - The `badge_scan` function calls `_get_command_line` to construct the command with the `badge_id`.
    - `subprocess.call(command)` executes the constructed command using the shell.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Configuration File (.authboxrc):
    [auth]
    command = /path/to/sample_auth_check.sh {0} tool_name auth_duration

    Python Code (two_button.py - badge_scan):
    badge_id = "; touch /tmp/pwned #"  <- Malicious Badge ID
    command_pieces = shlex.split("/path/to/sample_auth_check.sh {0} tool_name auth_duration")
    command_with_badge_id = [p.format(badge_id) for p in command_pieces]
    command_with_badge_id becomes:
    ['/path/to/sample_auth_check.sh', '; touch /tmp/pwned #', 'tool_name', 'auth_duration']
    subprocess.call(command_with_badge_id)

    Shell Execution:
    /bin/sh -c '/path/to/sample_auth_check.sh '; touch /tmp/pwned #'; 'tool_name' 'auth_duration'
    ```

    Because the command is executed by `/bin/sh -c "command line"`, the semicolon `;` in the badge ID will terminate the first command (`/path/to/sample_auth_check.sh`) and start a new command (`touch /tmp/pwned #`). The `#` will comment out the rest of the injected command.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure the system is set up to use `sample_auth_check.sh` (or similar script-based authorization).
    2. **Action:** Craft a badge ID containing a shell command injection payload, for example: `; touch /tmp/pwned #`.
    3. **Action:** Present this crafted badge to the RFID reader.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The `sample_auth_check.sh` script will be executed.
        - The injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` will also be executed by the shell.
        - Verify the command injection by checking if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the Raspberry Pi.
        - Check the logs (e.g., `log.txt` if used by `sample_auth_check.sh`) to observe the execution flow and potential errors.
    5. **Cleanup:** Remove the `/tmp/pwned` file after the test.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject shell commands by crafting a malicious badge ID, confirming the command injection vulnerability.
