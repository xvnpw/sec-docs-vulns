### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure GCS Path Handling in Data Ingestion

* Description:
    1. An attacker could manipulate the `bucket_name` and `prefix` parameters in the GCS input configuration during data ingestion via the Streamlit frontend.
    2. By providing a malicious GCS path, the attacker could potentially cause the data ingestion pipeline to access or process data from an unintended GCS bucket or prefix within a bucket.
    3. This could lead to unauthorized access to data if the attacker can specify a GCS path to which they should not have access, or unintended data processing if the pipeline processes data from an attacker-controlled location.

* Impact:
    - Unauthorized Data Access: An attacker might gain access to sensitive data stored in GCS buckets if input validation is insufficient.
    - Data Misuse: The system might process data from an attacker-controlled GCS location, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption within the RAG application.
    - Information Disclosure: Error messages or logs might inadvertently disclose information about GCS bucket structure or contents.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code files. The code appears to directly use the user-provided GCS bucket and prefix in the data processing pipeline without explicit validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization on the `bucket_name` and `prefix` parameters in the frontend and backend to ensure they conform to expected formats and potentially restrict access to only pre-approved buckets or paths.
    - Implement access control checks to verify that the service account used by the data ingestion pipeline has the necessary permissions only for intended GCS resources, and not arbitrary buckets.
    - Consider using a secure configuration mechanism to pre-define allowed GCS buckets or paths, instead of relying solely on user input.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs access to the Streamlit frontend to configure data ingestion parameters.
    - The RAG Playground instance must be deployed and accessible.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`/code/frontend/pages/1_ðŸ”¢_Prepare_Data.py`**: This file handles the frontend data ingestion configuration.
        ```python
        def configure_input():
            # ...
            elif input_type == "gcs":
                with st.expander("GCS Configuration"):
                    project_name = st.text_input("GCP Project ID", key="gcs_project_name")
                    bucket_name = st.text_input("GCS Bucket Name", key="gcs_bucket_name")
                    prefix = st.text_input("GCS Prefix (optional)", key="gcs_prefix")
                if st.button("Save GCS Configuration", key="save_gcs_config"):
                    st.session_state.input_config = {
                        "type": "gcs",
                        "config": {
                            "project_name": project_name,
                            "bucket_name": bucket_name,
                            "prefix": prefix,
                        },
                    }
                    st.success("GCS configuration saved!")
        ```
        - The frontend code takes user input for `bucket_name` and `prefix` without validation and stores it in `st.session_state.input_config`.

    2. **`/code/backend/routers/chunk_index_data.py`**: This backend router receives the ingestion request.
        ```python
        @router.post(path="/trigger-indexing-job")
        def create_indexing_job(data: PubSubMessage):
            # ...
            result = publish_message(data.model_dump_json())
            # ...
        ```
        - The backend router `/trigger-indexing-job` receives the `PubSubMessage` which includes the GCS configuration. It directly passes this data to `publish_message`.

    3. **`/code/backend/utils/pubsub_index_utils.py`**: This file publishes the message to Pub/Sub.
        ```python
        def publish_message(data: str) -> str:
            # ...
            message_bytes = data.encode("utf-8")
            publish_future = publisher.publish(topic_path, message_bytes)
            # ...
        ```
        - The `publish_message` function takes the JSON data and publishes it to Pub/Sub without any validation of the GCS path.

    4. **`/code/backend/data_processing_pipeline_beam/main.py`**: This is the Dataflow pipeline that consumes the Pub/Sub message.
        ```python
        class GCSInputFn(beam.DoFn):
            def process(self, element):
                try:
                    input_config = element["input"]["config"]

                    loader = CustomGCSDirectoryLoader(
                        project_name=input_config["project_name"],
                        bucket=input_config["bucket_name"],
                        prefix=input_config["prefix"],
                    )
                    # ...
                except Exception as e:
                    logging.error(f"Error processing input: {str(e)}")
        ```
        - The `GCSInputFn` in the Dataflow pipeline uses `CustomGCSDirectoryLoader` to load data from GCS. It directly uses the `bucket_name` and `prefix` from the input message without validation.
        - `CustomGCSDirectoryLoader` also directly uses these inputs to construct GCS paths.

    - **Visualization**:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Streamlit Frontend - Prepare Data Page] --> B(Backend - /trigger-indexing-job API);
        B --> C[Pub/Sub Topic];
        C --> D[Dataflow Pipeline - GCSInputFn];
        D --> E[CustomGCSDirectoryLoader];
        E --> F[GCS Bucket];
        A -- User Input (bucket_name, prefix) --> B;
        B -- PubSubMessage (JSON with GCS config) --> C;
        D -- GCS Config --> E;
        E -- GCS Path (user controlled) --> F;
    ```

    - The visualization and code analysis show that user-provided `bucket_name` and `prefix` are directly used to access GCS without proper validation or sanitization, creating a potential vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the RAG Playground application to a publicly accessible environment.
    2. As an attacker, access the Streamlit frontend through a web browser.
    3. Navigate to the "ðŸ”¢ Prepare Data" page.
    4. Select "gcs" as the input type.
    5. In the GCS Configuration, enter the Project ID of the deployed project.
    6. For "GCS Bucket Name", enter the name of a GCS bucket that you do not own or control, but is publicly readable (or a bucket within the same GCP project that contains sensitive data you shouldn't access). For example, a publicly accessible dataset bucket or another project's bucket if you have some form of cross-project access.
    7. For "GCS Prefix", you can leave it empty or specify a prefix within the malicious bucket.
    8. Click "Save GCS Configuration" and then navigate through the steps to "Review and Index".
    9. Click "Index Data".
    10. Observe the logs of the Dataflow pipeline. If successful, the pipeline might attempt to process data from the specified malicious bucket.
    11. To confirm unauthorized access, check if the Dataflow pipeline logs indicate successful listing or processing of files from the malicious bucket, or if the indexed data in Vertex AI Vector Search originates from the malicious bucket.
    12. If you can successfully trigger the pipeline to process data from the malicious bucket, this confirms the Insecure GCS Path Handling vulnerability.
