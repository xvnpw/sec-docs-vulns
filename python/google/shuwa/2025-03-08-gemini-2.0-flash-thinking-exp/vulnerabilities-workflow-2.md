## Combined Vulnerability Report

### Potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Gloss Name in Web Output

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker uses the "Record" mode in the application's GUI.
  2. When prompted for "Sign name" in the `name_box`, the attacker enters a malicious payload as the sign name, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_in_gloss_name')>`.
  3. The attacker clicks "Record", performs a gesture, clicks "Stop", and then clicks "Save". This action saves a KNN database file. Critically, the filename of this database is derived from the unsanitized "Sign name" entered by the attacker, resulting in a file named (in this example) `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_in_gloss_name')>.txt` within the `knn_dir`. The malicious sign name also becomes a `knn_label` within the application's internal data structures.
  4. Later, when a user switches to "Play mode" and performs gesture recognition using the webcam, the system attempts to classify the gesture. If the gesture is classified as the sign associated with the malicious name (or even if any classification occurs and the label is displayed), the application will retrieve and use the stored malicious `knn_label`.
  5. The application then displays the classification result in the `console_box` of the GUI using the following code in `webcam_demo.py`: `self.console_box.insert('end', f"Nearest class: {res_txt}\n")`, where `res_txt` is the malicious gloss name (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_in_gloss_name')>`).
  6. If the content of this `console_box`, specifically the `res_txt` value, is naively displayed on a webpage without proper sanitization (for instance, using `innerHTML` in a hypothetical web demo scenario), the HTML and JavaScript payload within the `res_txt` (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_in_gloss_name')>`) will be executed in the user's browser. This execution of attacker-controlled scripts in the context of the user's web session constitutes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact:**
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session if the application's console output is displayed on a webpage without sanitization. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing sensitive user information, such as cookies and session tokens, which can be used to impersonate the user.
    - Redirecting users to attacker-controlled malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    - Defacing the intended web page content, disrupting the user experience.
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, depending on the application's functionalities and the user's permissions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
  This is ranked as a medium severity vulnerability because it is a Stored XSS, which can have significant impact. However, the exploitability in a typical web context is conditional. It depends on whether and how the Tkinter GUI's `console_box` output is exposed in a web environment. If the `console_box` is strictly confined to the desktop application and not used in any web-based interface, the risk to web users is mitigated. However, given the project description includes a "Web Demo", the potential for web exposure and thus the XSS risk is present and should be addressed.
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. Based on the provided source code, there are no explicit input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms implemented to prevent XSS. The application directly uses the user-provided sign name to create filenames and displays potentially user-influenced text in the console without any form of security processing.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for the "Sign name" field in the "Record" mode. This should involve encoding or removing HTML special characters and JavaScript-related syntax before the sign name is used to create filenames or stored as labels.  A recommended approach is to allow only alphanumeric characters and spaces for sign names, or to HTML-encode any special characters if they are necessary for display but not for code execution.
  - Output Encoding: If the `console_box` content, especially the `res_txt` (classification result), is intended to be displayed in a web context, it is crucial to implement output encoding. This would involve HTML-encoding the `res_txt` before rendering it on the webpage. This ensures that any HTML tags or JavaScript code within `res_txt` are treated as plain text and not executed by the browser. Server-side or client-side templating engines with auto-escaping features can be used to achieve this.
- **Preconditions:**
  1. Access to the Shuwa Gesture Toolkit application GUI, specifically the "Record" mode and "Save" functionality. This is typically available to any user running the desktop application.
  2. A hypothetical scenario where the application's `console_box` output (or the classification results derived from the KNN database filenames) is displayed on a webpage without proper output sanitization. This precondition assumes a specific (and potentially insecure) implementation of a "web demo" component that is not explicitly detailed in the provided project files but is implied by the project description and README.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - File: `/code/webcam_demo.py`
    - `save_btn_cb` function:
      ```python
      gloss_name = self.name_box.get()
      ...
      self.translator_manager.save_knn_database(gloss_name, self.knn_records)
      ```
      This code snippet retrieves the sign name directly from the `name_box` using `self.name_box.get()` without any sanitization. This `gloss_name` is then passed to `self.translator_manager.save_knn_database`. Looking into `translator_manager.py`:
      ```python
      def save_knn_database(self, gloss_name, knn_records):
          output_path = Path(self.knn_dir, gloss_name + ".txt")
          ...
      ```
      The `gloss_name` is directly used to construct the `output_path` for saving the KNN database file. This means a malicious `gloss_name` will result in a malicious filename.
    - `record_btn_cb` function (in play mode):
      ```python
      res_txt = self.translator_manager.run_knn(feats)
      self.console_box.insert('end', f"Nearest class: {res_txt}\n")
      ```
      The classification result `res_txt`, which is derived from the `knn_labels` (and thus indirectly from the filenames which are based on user-provided `gloss_name`), is inserted into the `console_box` without any sanitization.
  - Visualization:
    [Conceptual Data Flow for XSS]
    ```
    User Input (Sign Name in GUI) --> [webcam_demo.py - name_box.get()] --> gloss_name --> [translator_manager.py - save_knn_database] --> Filename (unsanitized) --> KNN Database Files --> knn_labels (loaded into memory) --> [translator_manager.py - run_knn] --> res_txt (potentially malicious) --> [webcam_demo.py - console_box.insert] --> GUI Console Output --> [Hypothetical Web Demo] --> Webpage Display (unsanitized) --> XSS
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the Shuwa Gesture Toolkit application on a test machine, ensuring you have write access to the `knn_dir` where KNN databases are saved.
  2. **Record Malicious Sign:**
     - Launch the `webcam_demo.py` application.
     - Switch to the "Record" tab in the GUI.
     - In the "Sign name" text box, enter the following XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Test')>`.
     - Click the "Record" button, perform any hand gesture in front of the webcam for a few seconds, and then click "Stop".
     - Click the "Save" button. This saves a KNN database file named `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Test')>.txt` in the `knn_dataset` directory (or configured `knn_dir`).
  3. **Trigger Play Mode and Observe (Hypothetical Web Scenario):**
     - Switch to the "Play mode" tab.
     - Perform a gesture in front of the webcam. It's not crucial that the gesture is correctly classified; the goal is to trigger the display of a classification result.
     - **Simulate Web Display:** Since the provided code is not a web application, you would need to simulate the scenario where the `console_box` output is displayed on a webpage.  For a basic test, you can manually extract the text content from the `console_box` after performing the gesture in "Play mode."  If you were to then take this text and naively insert it into an HTML page using `innerHTML` in a browser, you would expect the XSS payload to execute.  Alternatively, if you have a simplified web server that can read the classification result from the application (e.g., by reading the last line written to a log file or through some inter-process communication) and display it, you can test the XSS in a more realistic, albeit still simplified, web context.
  4. **Expected Outcome:** If the `console_box` output, containing the malicious sign name, is displayed on a webpage using `innerHTML` or similar unsanitized methods, an alert box with the message "XSS_Test" should appear in the browser. This confirms the Stored XSS vulnerability, demonstrating that malicious JavaScript code injected through the sign name can be executed when the classification result is displayed in a web context. If testing only within the Tkinter GUI, you will likely just see the raw text `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Test')>` displayed in the console box, but the vulnerability is present if this output were to be used in a web context unsafely.

### Potential Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability via Malicious Model

- **Description:**
    An attacker could potentially craft a malicious pickled machine learning model and trick a user into using it with the `webcam_demo.py` script. If the application loads machine learning models using pickle deserialization, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is triggered when the `webcam_demo.py` script attempts to load a model from a potentially compromised source. While the provided code doesn't explicitly show pickle usage for model loading, the description from the prompt suggests this as a potential attack vector. If TensorFlow's model loading mechanism internally uses pickle or a similar deserialization process and the application allows loading models from untrusted sources, it could be vulnerable.
- **Impact:**
    If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized access.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There are no explicit mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent pickle deserialization vulnerabilities. The code does not include input validation or sanitization for model files, nor does it restrict the source of model files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: The application should validate the integrity and source of machine learning models before loading them.
    - Secure deserialization practices: If pickle or similar deserialization is used, it should be replaced with safer alternatives or implemented with extreme caution, ensuring that untrusted data is never deserialized. Model loading should ideally be restricted to trusted formats and sources.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Running the model loading and inference in a sandboxed environment could limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    - Documentation and warnings: Users should be warned against using models from untrusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must download and attempt to use a malicious machine learning model provided by the attacker.
    - The `webcam_demo.py` script must be configured or modified to load this malicious model.
    - The underlying TensorFlow library or the project's model loading mechanism must be vulnerable to pickle deserialization or a similar exploit when handling malicious model files.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    The provided code snippets do not explicitly show the use of pickle for loading machine learning models. However, the `TranslatorManager` class in `/code/modules/translator/translator_manager.py` is responsible for loading and managing the machine learning model:
    ```python
    class TranslatorManager():
        def __init__(self, model_path: str, labels: dict, knn_dir: str, n_frames: int) -> None:
            # ...
            self.model = model.get_model()
            self.model.load_weights(model_path) # Potentially vulnerable line
            self.model = tf.function(self.model)
            # ...
    ```
    The line `self.model.load_weights(model_path)` in `TranslatorManager.__init__` is the potential point of vulnerability. If `model_path` points to a file that is loaded using pickle or a similar insecure deserialization method, and if this file is provided by an attacker, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.  Without knowing the exact implementation of `model.load_weights` and the format of the `model_path` file, it's impossible to confirm the vulnerability from the provided code alone. However, based on the prompt description, this is highlighted as a potential issue.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
        - Create a malicious TensorFlow model file. This file should be crafted to execute arbitrary code when loaded using `tf.keras.models.load_model` or a similar function that might be vulnerable to pickle deserialization.  A simple way to achieve this is by including a custom layer with malicious code in its `__reduce__` method if TensorFlow's model loading relies on pickle internally.
        - Host this malicious model file on an attacker-controlled server or distribute it through a channel where a user might be tricked into downloading it.

    2. **Attack Execution:**
        - Trick the user into downloading the malicious model file, for example, by sending a phishing email or hosting it on a website that appears legitimate.
        - Instruct the user to modify the `model_path` configuration in the Shuwa Gesture Toolkit to point to the downloaded malicious model file. This configuration might be within the `configs/translator_inference.gin` file or passed as a command-line argument, depending on how `model_path` is configured.
        - Run the `webcam_demo.py` script. The application will attempt to load the model from the specified path.

    3. **Verification:**
        - If the vulnerability exists, the malicious code embedded in the model file will be executed during the model loading process.
        - Verify code execution by observing unexpected system behavior, monitoring for network connections to attacker-controlled servers, or checking for file system modifications that indicate successful arbitrary code execution. A simple test is to make the malicious model create a file in the user's temporary directory or initiate a reverse shell connection.

    4. **Expected Outcome:**
        - If vulnerable, running `webcam_demo.py` with the malicious model should result in the execution of the attacker's code.
        - If not vulnerable or mitigated, the application should load without executing malicious code, or it should fail to load the malicious model due to security checks.

### Path Traversal in KNN Database Save Function

- **Description:**
  1. The application allows users to record and save new gesture classes.
  2. When saving a new gesture class, the application takes the class name from the text input field labeled "Sign name" in the GUI.
  3. This user-provided class name, referred to as `gloss_name`, is used to construct the file path for saving the KNN database file.
  4. The file path is created by joining the base directory `knn_dir` with the `gloss_name` and the ".txt" extension.
  5. The application does not sanitize or validate the `gloss_name` input.
  6. A malicious user can input a `gloss_name` containing path traversal characters such as `../` to manipulate the output file path.
  7. By crafting a malicious `gloss_name`, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the file system where the application has write permissions.
  8. For example, if the user inputs `../evil_file`, the application might attempt to save the KNN database to a location outside the intended `knn_dir`, potentially overwriting critical system files or application files.
- **Impact:**
  - File system compromise: An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting existing files, including configuration files, application binaries, or system files.
  - Data exfiltration: An attacker could potentially write application data or internal configuration to a publicly accessible location.
  - Code execution (potentially): In a more advanced scenario, if the attacker can overwrite executable files or scripts, they might be able to achieve remote code execution, depending on the system's configuration and permissions.
  - Data integrity compromise: Overwriting application or data files can lead to data corruption or application malfunction.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The application directly uses the user-provided input to construct the file path without any sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input sanitization: Sanitize the `gloss_name` input to remove or escape path traversal characters like `../`, `..\` , absolute paths, and special characters.
  - Path validation: Validate the constructed file path to ensure it remains within the intended `knn_dir` and does not traverse to parent directories or arbitrary locations.
  - Using secure file path construction: Utilize secure path joining functions provided by the operating system or libraries that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The application must be running with write permissions to the file system.
  - An attacker needs to have access to the GUI of the application, specifically the "Record" tab and the "Sign name" input field. This is typically a local desktop application, so physical or remote access to the machine running the application is required. However, if the GUI is exposed through a web interface (as suggested in the initial analysis based on "web demo", though not evident in provided code), the precondition would be network access to the web interface. In the provided code context, it's a local application.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. File: `/code/webcam_demo.py`
  2. Function: `save_btn_cb`
  3. Line: `gloss_name = self.name_box.get()` - Retrieves user input from the "Sign name" text box.
  4. Line: `self.translator_manager.save_knn_database(gloss_name, self.knn_records)` - Calls the `save_knn_database` function in `translator_manager.py` and passes the unsanitized `gloss_name`.
  5. File: `/code/modules/translator/translator_manager.py`
  6. Function: `save_knn_database`
  7. Line: `output_path = Path(self.knn_dir, gloss_name + ".txt")` - Constructs the file path by directly joining `self.knn_dir` and `gloss_name + ".txt"`. No sanitization or validation is performed on `gloss_name` before constructing the path.
  8. Visualization:
     ```
     User Input (GUI "Sign name" box) --> gloss_name (string) --> save_btn_cb (webcam_demo.py) --> save_knn_database (translator_manager.py) --> Path Construction (Path(self.knn_dir, gloss_name + ".txt")) --> File System Write (np.savetxt)
     ```
     This flow shows that the user-controlled `gloss_name` is directly used in path construction without any checks, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Precondition: The Shuwa Gesture Toolkit webcam demo application is running.
  2. Step 1: Open the Shuwa Gesture Toolkit application.
  3. Step 2: Navigate to the "Record" tab in the GUI.
  4. Step 3: In the "Sign name" text box, enter a malicious payload designed for path traversal, for example: `../../evil_file`.
  5. Step 4: Click the "Record" button and record a short gesture (or just wait for a few seconds as recording starts).
  6. Step 5: Click the "Stop" button.
  7. Step 6: Click the "Save" button.
  8. Step 7: Check the file system in the directory two levels above the `knn_dir` (defined in configs/translator_inference.gin, likely within the project directory).
  9. Expected Result: A file named `evil_file.txt` should be created in the directory two levels above the intended `knn_dir`. This confirms successful path traversal. If you configured `knn_dir` to be `./knn_dataset`, the file should be created at `../evil_file.txt` relative to the project root.
  10. Note: The exact location of `knn_dir` and the output file will depend on the application's configuration and where it is run. Adjust the test case steps and expected result based on your local setup.
