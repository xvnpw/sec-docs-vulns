### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in KNN Database Save Function

- Description:
  1. The application allows users to record and save new gesture classes.
  2. When saving a new gesture class, the application takes the class name from the text input field labeled "Sign name" in the GUI.
  3. This user-provided class name, referred to as `gloss_name`, is used to construct the file path for saving the KNN database file.
  4. The file path is created by joining the base directory `knn_dir` with the `gloss_name` and the ".txt" extension.
  5. The application does not sanitize or validate the `gloss_name` input.
  6. A malicious user can input a `gloss_name` containing path traversal characters such as `../` to manipulate the output file path.
  7. By crafting a malicious `gloss_name`, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the file system where the application has write permissions.
  8. For example, if the user inputs `../evil_file`, the application might attempt to save the KNN database to a location outside the intended `knn_dir`, potentially overwriting critical system files or application files.

- Impact:
  - File system compromise: An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting existing files, including configuration files, application binaries, or system files.
  - Data exfiltration: An attacker could potentially write application data or internal configuration to a publicly accessible location.
  - Code execution (potentially): In a more advanced scenario, if the attacker can overwrite executable files or scripts, they might be able to achieve remote code execution, depending on the system's configuration and permissions.
  - Data integrity compromise: Overwriting application or data files can lead to data corruption or application malfunction.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The application directly uses the user-provided input to construct the file path without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: Sanitize the `gloss_name` input to remove or escape path traversal characters like `../`, `..\` , absolute paths, and special characters.
  - Path validation: Validate the constructed file path to ensure it remains within the intended `knn_dir` and does not traverse to parent directories or arbitrary locations.
  - Using secure file path construction: Utilize secure path joining functions provided by the operating system or libraries that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
  - The application must be running with write permissions to the file system.
  - An attacker needs to have access to the GUI of the application, specifically the "Record" tab and the "Sign name" input field. This is typically a local desktop application, so physical or remote access to the machine running the application is required. However, if the GUI is exposed through a web interface (as suggested in the initial analysis based on "web demo", though not evident in provided code), the precondition would be network access to the web interface. In the provided code context, it's a local application.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/webcam_demo.py`
  2. Function: `save_btn_cb`
  3. Line: `gloss_name = self.name_box.get()` - Retrieves user input from the "Sign name" text box.
  4. Line: `self.translator_manager.save_knn_database(gloss_name, self.knn_records)` - Calls the `save_knn_database` function in `translator_manager.py` and passes the unsanitized `gloss_name`.
  5. File: `/code/modules/translator/translator_manager.py`
  6. Function: `save_knn_database`
  7. Line: `output_path = Path(self.knn_dir, gloss_name + ".txt")` - Constructs the file path by directly joining `self.knn_dir` and `gloss_name + ".txt"`. No sanitization or validation is performed on `gloss_name` before constructing the path.
  8. Visualization:
     ```
     User Input (GUI "Sign name" box) --> gloss_name (string) --> save_btn_cb (webcam_demo.py) --> save_knn_database (translator_manager.py) --> Path Construction (Path(self.knn_dir, gloss_name + ".txt")) --> File System Write (np.savetxt)
     ```
     This flow shows that the user-controlled `gloss_name` is directly used in path construction without any checks, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Precondition: The Shuwa Gesture Toolkit webcam demo application is running.
  2. Step 1: Open the Shuwa Gesture Toolkit application.
  3. Step 2: Navigate to the "Record" tab in the GUI.
  4. Step 3: In the "Sign name" text box, enter a malicious payload designed for path traversal, for example: `../../evil_file`.
  5. Step 4: Click the "Record" button and record a short gesture (or just wait for a few seconds as recording starts).
  6. Step 5: Click the "Stop" button.
  7. Step 6: Click the "Save" button.
  8. Step 7: Check the file system in the directory two levels above the `knn_dir` (defined in configs/translator_inference.gin, likely within the project directory).
  9. Expected Result: A file named `evil_file.txt` should be created in the directory two levels above the intended `knn_dir`. This confirms successful path traversal. If you configured `knn_dir` to be `./knn_dataset`, the file should be created at `../evil_file.txt` relative to the project root.
  10. Note: The exact location of `knn_dir` and the output file will depend on the application's configuration and where it is run. Adjust the test case steps and expected result based on your local setup.
