## Combined Vulnerability List for LightweightMMM Project

Below is a combined list of identified vulnerabilities in the LightweightMMM project, after removing duplicates and filtering based on the specified criteria.

### 1. Insecure Deserialization in `utils.load_model`

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious pickle file containing arbitrary code.
    2. The attacker tricks a user into downloading or providing access to this malicious file, for example, by hosting it on a website or sending it via email.
    3. The user, intending to load a legitimate model, uses the `utils.load_model` function and provides the path to the attacker's malicious pickle file.
    4. The `pickle.load` function in `utils.load_model` deserializes the malicious file without any security checks.
    5. During deserialization, the malicious code embedded in the pickle file gets executed on the user's system.

- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the machine running the Lightweight MMM library.
    - This can lead to full system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and complete control over the affected system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses `pickle.load` without any input validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Replace `pickle.load` with a safer serialization method. Consider using `torch.save` with a trusted format if the model can be represented in a format compatible with it.
    - Implement input validation to check the file path and file content before deserialization. However, input validation might be insufficient to prevent all types of insecure deserialization attacks with `pickle`.
    - Warn users about the security risks of loading model files from untrusted sources in the documentation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must download or have access to a malicious model file provided by the attacker.
    - The user must then attempt to load this malicious file using the `utils.load_model` function.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/lightweight_mmm/utils.py`
    - Function: `load_model`
    ```python
    def load_model(file_path: str) -> Any:
      """Loads a model given a string path.
      ...
      """
      with gfile.GFile(file_path, "rb") as file:
        media_mix_model = pickle.load(file=file) # Insecure deserialization vulnerability
      ...
      return media_mix_model
    ```
    - The `pickle.load(file=file)` line is the source of the vulnerability. It directly deserializes data from the provided file path without any checks, making it susceptible to arbitrary code execution.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious pickle file (e.g., `malicious_model.pkl`) with the following Python code embedded:
    ```python
    import pickle
    import subprocess
    import os

    class MaliciousModel:
        def __reduce__(self):
            return (subprocess.Popen, (['touch', '/tmp/pwned'],))

    model = MaliciousModel()
    pickle.dump(model, open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb'))
    ```
    2. Host `malicious_model.pkl` on a mock website or make it accessible to the user in some way.
    3. In a Python script using `lightweight_mmm`, use `utils.load_model` to load the malicious file:
    ```python
    from lightweight_mmm import utils
    try:
        model = utils.load_model(file_path='malicious_model.pkl') # or path to hosted file
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

    # Check if the malicious code was executed (e.g., check if `/tmp/pwned` file exists)
    import os
    if os.path.exists('/tmp/pwned'):
        print("Vulnerability confirmed: Arbitrary code execution successful!")
    else:
        print("Vulnerability test inconclusive: File '/tmp/pwned' not found.")
    ```
    4. Run the Python script. If the vulnerability is present, the malicious code (creating `/tmp/pwned` file in this example) will be executed.

### 2. Data Poisoning through Unvalidated Input Data

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts malicious marketing data to skew the LightweightMMM model's analysis.
    2. The attacker injects this poisoned data into the `media`, `extra_features`, or `target` parameters when calling the `fit` method to train the model.
    3. Alternatively, for manipulating predictions without retraining, poisoned data can be injected into `media` or `extra_features` parameters when calling `predict`.
    4. LightweightMMM lacks robust input validation, so the poisoned data is processed without sanitization or anomaly detection.
    5. During model fitting, poisoned data biases model parameters.
    6. When used for marketing mix modeling and budget optimization, skewed parameters lead to misleading insights and flawed budget allocation recommendations.
    7. Unaware users rely on the model's output, making suboptimal marketing decisions.

- **Impact:**
    - Flawed marketing insights and budget optimization, leading to resource misallocation.
    - Reduced marketing effectiveness and financial losses for organizations.
    - Loss of trust in LightweightMMM.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `preprocessing.check_data_quality` exists but is not enforced in `fit` or `predict`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input data validation in `fit` and `predict` methods, including:
        - Data type and format validation.
        - Range checks.
        - Anomaly detection.
        - Data sanitization or filtering.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker's ability to manipulate input data for `fit` or `predict`. This could be through:
        - Direct access to data pipeline.
        - Man-in-the-middle attacks.
        - Compromised systems/accounts.
        - Publicly accessible instance (less likely for a library).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `lightweight_mmm.py`: `fit` and `predict` methods lack input validation.
    - `lightweight_mmm/utils.py`: `dataframe_to_jax` is for conversion, not validation.
    - `lightweight_mmm/preprocessing.py`: `CustomScaler` scales data, does not validate. `check_data_quality` is not enforced.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup: Install `lightweight_mmm`, prepare valid dataset.
    2. Data Poisoning - Training Phase:
        - Introduce outliers to `media_data` or manipulate `target`.
        - Run `LightweightMMM.fit` with poisoned data.
        - Observe biased model parameters using `mmm.print_summary()`.
        - Compare poisoned vs. clean model insights and optimization results.
    3. Data Poisoning - Prediction Phase:
        - Load pre-trained model (clean data).
        - Prepare test dataset.
        - Introduce poisoned data to test dataset.
        - Run `LightweightMMM.predict` with poisoned test data.
        - Compare poisoned vs. clean data predictions to observe misleading insights.
