- vulnerability name: Insecure Deserialization in Model Loading
- description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python pickle file containing malicious code.
  2. The attacker tricks a user into downloading this malicious pickle file, perhaps by hosting it on a seemingly legitimate website or sending it via email.
  3. The user, intending to load a LightweightMMM model, uses the `lightweight_mmm.utils.load_model` function and provides the path to the malicious pickle file.
  4. The `load_model` function, internally using Python's `pickle.load`, deserializes the malicious pickle file.
  5. During deserialization, the malicious code embedded in the pickle file gets executed, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- impact: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine of a user who loads a malicious model file. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or any other malicious actions the attacker desires.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations: No mitigations are implemented in the provided code. The `load_model` function directly uses `pickle.load` without any security considerations.
- missing mitigations:
  - Replace `pickle` with a secure serialization format like `safetensors` or `json`.
  - Implement input validation and sanitization on the loaded model file.
  - If `pickle` must be used, implement robust authentication and integrity checks to ensure the loaded file originates from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
- preconditions:
  - The user must download and attempt to load a malicious model file provided by an attacker.
  - The user must have the LightweightMMM library installed and use the `load_model` function.
- source code analysis:
  1. File: `/code/lightweight_mmm/utils.py`
  2. Function: `load_model(file_path: str)`
  3. The function opens the file specified by `file_path` in binary read mode (`"rb"`).
  4. It then uses `pickle.load(file=file)` to deserialize the contents of the file.
  5. `pickle.load` is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the pickle file is maliciously crafted.
  6. There are no checks or sanitization performed on the file or its contents before deserialization.
- security test case:
  1. Create a malicious pickle file (`malicious_model.pkl`) using the following Python code:
  ```python
  import pickle
  import os

  class Malicious载体:
      def __reduce__(self):
          return (os.system, ('touch /tmp/pwned',))

  恶意载体_instance = Malicious载体()
  with open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
      pickle.dump(恶意载体_instance, f)
  ```
  This script creates a pickle file that, when loaded, will execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned`.
  2. Host `malicious_model.pkl` on a mock website or make it accessible to the user in some way.
  3. Instruct the user to load this 'model' using `lightweight_mmm.utils.load_model`:
  ```python
  from lightweight_mmm import utils
  utils.load_model(file_path='malicious_model.pkl')
  ```
  4. After executing the script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system. If it exists, the vulnerability is confirmed because arbitrary code (`touch /tmp/pwned`) was executed during model loading.
