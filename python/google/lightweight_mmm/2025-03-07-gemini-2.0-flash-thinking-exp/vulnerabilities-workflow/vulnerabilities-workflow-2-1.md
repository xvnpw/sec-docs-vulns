- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization in `utils.load_model`
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious pickle file containing arbitrary code.
  2. The attacker tricks a user into downloading or providing access to this malicious file, for example, by hosting it on a website or sending it via email.
  3. The user, intending to load a legitimate model, uses the `utils.load_model` function and provides the path to the attacker's malicious pickle file.
  4. The `pickle.load` function in `utils.load_model` deserializes the malicious file without any security checks.
  5. During deserialization, the malicious code embedded in the pickle file gets executed on the user's system.
- Impact:
  - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the machine running the Lightweight MMM library.
  - This can lead to full system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and complete control over the affected system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly uses `pickle.load` without any input validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Replace `pickle.load` with a safer serialization method. Consider using `torch.save` with a trusted format if the model can be represented in a format compatible with it.
  - Implement input validation to check the file path and file content before deserialization. However, input validation might be insufficient to prevent all types of insecure deserialization attacks with `pickle`.
  - Warn users about the security risks of loading model files from untrusted sources in the documentation.
- Preconditions:
  - The user must download or have access to a malicious model file provided by the attacker.
  - The user must then attempt to load this malicious file using the `utils.load_model` function.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/lightweight_mmm/utils.py`
  - Function: `load_model`
  ```python
  def load_model(file_path: str) -> Any:
    """Loads a model given a string path.
    ...
    """
    with gfile.GFile(file_path, "rb") as file:
      media_mix_model = pickle.load(file=file) # Insecure deserialization vulnerability
    ...
    return media_mix_model
  ```
  - The `pickle.load(file=file)` line is the source of the vulnerability. It directly deserializes data from the provided file path without any checks, making it susceptible to arbitrary code execution.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a malicious pickle file (e.g., `malicious_model.pkl`) with the following Python code embedded:
  ```python
  import pickle
  import subprocess
  import os

  class MaliciousModel:
      def __reduce__(self):
          return (subprocess.Popen, (['touch', '/tmp/pwned'],))

  model = MaliciousModel()
  pickle.dump(model, open('malicious_model.pkl', 'wb'))
  ```
  2. Host `malicious_model.pkl` on a mock website or make it accessible to the user in some way.
  3. In a Python script using `lightweight_mmm`, use `utils.load_model` to load the malicious file:
  ```python
  from lightweight_mmm import utils
  try:
      model = utils.load_model(file_path='malicious_model.pkl') # or path to hosted file
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

  # Check if the malicious code was executed (e.g., check if `/tmp/pwned` file exists)
  import os
  if os.path.exists('/tmp/pwned'):
      print("Vulnerability confirmed: Arbitrary code execution successful!")
  else:
      print("Vulnerability test inconclusive: File '/tmp/pwned' not found.")
  ```
  4. Run the Python script. If the vulnerability is present, the malicious code (creating `/tmp/pwned` file in this example) will be executed.
