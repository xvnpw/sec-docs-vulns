- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in File Path Arguments

- Description:
  1. The Flood-Filling Networks application uses Python scripts (`run_inference.py`, `train.py`, `build_coordinates.py`, `compute_partitions.py`) that accept file paths as command-line arguments.
  2. These file paths are used to specify input volumes, output volumes, coordinate files, and other data files.
  3. If these file paths are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially supply malicious paths (e.g., containing "../") to access files outside of the intended directories.
  4. For example, in `run_inference.py`, the `--inference_request` flag takes a file path to a configuration file. If this path is not sanitized, an attacker could provide a path like "../../sensitive_file.pbtxt" to read sensitive configuration files. Similarly, the `--segmentation_output_dir` flag in `run_inference.py`, and flags in other scripts like `--data_volumes`, `--label_volumes`, `--coordinate_output`, `--partition_volumes`, `--input_volume`, and `--output_volume` could be vulnerable.

- Impact:
  An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, configuration files, or even source code. In write contexts, like `--output_volume` or `--coordinate_output`, an attacker might be able to write files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting system files or injecting malicious code.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  No explicit path sanitization or validation is evident in the provided source code. The scripts directly use user-supplied paths with functions like `gfile.exists`, `gfile.makedirs`, `h5py.File`, and `tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter` without any sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input path sanitization: Implement proper path sanitization for all file path arguments in the Python scripts. This should include:
    - Using absolute paths: Convert user-supplied paths to absolute paths using `os.path.abspath`.
    - Path canonicalization: Canonicalize paths to remove symbolic links and redundant separators using `os.path.realpath` or `os.path.normpath`.
    - Input validation: Validate that the provided paths are within the expected directories or meet specific criteria (e.g., whitelisting allowed directories).

- Preconditions:
  1. The Flood-Filling Networks application must be running and accessible to an attacker.
  2. The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the Python scripts, either directly (if the application exposes a command-line interface) or indirectly (e.g., through a web interface that passes user-supplied paths to the scripts).

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **`run_inference.py`**:
     - `FLAGS.inference_request` is directly passed to `text_format.Parse()`. While `text_format.Parse()` itself is safe, the *content* of the file can be controlled by path traversal.
     - `request.segmentation_output_dir` is directly used in `gfile.exists()` and `gfile.makedirs()`.
     - `counter_path` is constructed using `request.segmentation_output_dir` and `os.path.join()`, and then used with `gfile.exists()`.

  2. **`build_coordinates.py`**:
     - `FLAGS.partition_volumes` paths are split and directly used with `h5py.File(path, 'r')`.
     - `FLAGS.coordinate_output` is directly used with `tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter()`.

  3. **`compute_partitions.py`**:
     - `FLAGS.input_volume` path is split and directly used with `h5py.File(path)`.
     - `FLAGS.output_volume` path is split and directly used with `h5py.File(path, 'w')`.
     - `FLAGS.mask_configs` (if used) paths within the MaskConfigs proto are processed by `storage.build_mask()`, which may also involve file operations based on the MaskConfigs definition (not directly visible in this script but relevant).

  4. **`train.py`**:
     - `FLAGS.train_coords` path is directly used by `inputs.load_patch_coordinates()`.
     - `FLAGS.data_volumes` and `FLAGS.label_volumes` paths are split and directly used with `h5py.File(path)[dataset]`.
     - `FLAGS.train_dir` is directly used with `gfile.exists()`, `gfile.makedirs()` and `gfile.GFile()`.

  In all these cases, there is no path sanitization before using the file paths in file system operations.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Set up a Flood-Filling Networks environment as described in the README.md.
  2. Prepare a malicious inference request configuration file (e.g., `configs/malicious_inference.pbtxt`) with a path traversal payload in the `image` field. For example, if the `image` field expects a path, modify it to point to a sensitive file outside of the expected directory, such as:
     ```
     image {
       volume_path: "../../etc/passwd:/dataset_name"
     }
     ...
     ```
  3. Run `run_inference.py` with the malicious configuration file and a bounding box:
     ```shell
     python run_inference.py --inference_request="configs/malicious_inference.pbtxt" --bounding_box 'start { x:0 y:0 z:0 } size { x:10 y:10 z:10 }'
     ```
  4. Observe the application's behavior. If the vulnerability exists, the application might attempt to access or read the `/etc/passwd` file (or any other file specified in the malicious path) and potentially expose its content or cause errors related to accessing unexpected files.
  5. To test write path traversal in `build_coordinates.py`, craft a malicious command:
     ```shell
     python build_coordinates.py \
        --partition_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/af.h5:af \
        --coordinate_output "/tmp/../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_coords" \
        --margin 24,24,24
     ```
  6. Check if a file `evil_coords` is created in `/tmp` directory (or any other unexpected location based on the path traversal).
