- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Input Paths in Data Preparation Scripts
- Description:
    1. An attacker can manipulate the input data paths provided to `compute_partitions.py` and `build_coordinates.py` scripts.
    2. By providing a path to a malicious HDF5 file instead of a legitimate one, the attacker can control the data read by these scripts.
    3. Specifically, the `--input_volume` argument in `compute_partitions.py` and `--partition_volumes` argument in `build_coordinates.py` are vulnerable.
    4. If the malicious HDF5 file is crafted to contain poisoned labels or partitions, the generated TFRecord file (coordinates) will be based on this poisoned data.
    5. This poisoned TFRecord file is then used by `train.py` to train the FFN model, leading to data poisoning.
- Impact:
    - The FFN model will be trained on poisoned data, leading to incorrect instance segmentation.
    - When used for neuroscience applications, this can result in flawed analysis of brain tissue data, potentially misidentifying or misrepresenting neuronal structures.
    - This could have serious consequences in research or diagnostic settings relying on accurate segmentation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the provided paths without validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path validation: Implement checks to ensure that the provided input paths point to expected and trusted locations or data sources.
    - Data validation: Implement checks to validate the integrity and format of the data read from the input HDF5 files. This could include schema validation or checks for anomalous data patterns.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments passed to `compute_partitions.py` and `build_coordinates.py`. This could be achieved if the scripts are used in an automated pipeline where input paths are configurable or if an attacker can convince a user to run the scripts with malicious arguments.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `compute_partitions.py`:
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_string('input_volume', None,
                            'Segmentation volume as <volume_path>:<dataset>, where'
                            'volume_path points to a HDF5 volume.')
        ...
        def main(argv):
          del argv  # Unused.
          path, dataset = FLAGS.input_volume.split(':') # [VULNERABLE LINE]
          with h5py.File(path) as f: # [VULNERABLE LINE]
            segmentation = f[dataset]
            ...
        ```
        The `FLAGS.input_volume` string is split directly using `:`. The `path` variable is then directly used to open the HDF5 file without any validation. An attacker can control the `path` value.

    - `build_coordinates.py`:
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_list('partition_volumes', None,
                          'Partition volumes as '
                          '<volume_name>:<volume_path>:<dataset>, where volume_path '
                          'points to a HDF5 volume, and <volume_name> is an arbitrary '
                          'label that will have to also be used during training.')
        ...
        def main(argv):
          del argv  # Unused.
          ...
          for i, partvol in enumerate(FLAGS.partition_volumes):
            name, path, dataset = partvol.split(':') # [VULNERABLE LINE]
            with h5py.File(path, 'r') as f: # [VULNERABLE LINE]
              partitions = f[dataset][mz:-mz, my:-mx]
              ...
        ```
        Similar to `compute_partitions.py`, the `FLAGS.partition_volumes` list is parsed, and the `path` is directly used to open HDF5 files without validation. An attacker can control the `path` value.

    - `train.py`: While `train.py` uses the TFRecord file generated by `build_coordinates.py`, the vulnerability is in the data preparation scripts themselves. `train.py` is the victim of the poisoned data.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Assume a standard installation of the FFN project as described in `README.md`.
        - Create a malicious HDF5 file (`malicious_data.h5`) containing poisoned partition data. This file can be placed in `/tmp/malicious_data.h5` for example. The structure should mimic the expected format of partition volumes (e.g. a dataset named `af`). The content of the dataset should be crafted to induce data poisoning. For simplicity, let's assume we want to poison the model to mis-segment a specific region or object.
    2. **Execution**:
        - Run `build_coordinates.py` with the `--partition_volumes` argument pointing to the malicious HDF5 file:
          ```shell
          python build_coordinates.py \
             --partition_volumes validation1:/tmp/malicious_data.h5:af \
             --coordinate_output /tmp/poisoned_coords.tfrecord \
             --margin 24,24,24
          ```
        - Run `train.py` using the poisoned coordinate file and legitimate data/label volumes. For simplicity we can use the example data provided in the repository.
          ```shell
          python train.py \
            --train_coords /tmp/poisoned_coords.tfrecord \
            --data_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/grayscale_maps.h5:raw \
            --label_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/groundtruth.h5:stack \
            --model_name convstack_3d.ConvStack3DFFNModel \
            --model_args "{\"depth\": 12, \"fov_size\": [33, 33, 33], \"deltas\": [8, 8, 8]}" \
            --image_mean 128 \
            --image_stddev 33 \
            --train_dir /tmp/poisoned_model
          ```
        - Run inference using the model trained on poisoned data and observe the segmentation results. For example using `run_inference.py` with a sample config.
          ```shell
          python run_inference.py \
            --inference_request="$(cat configs/inference_training_sample2.pbtxt)" \
            --bounding_box 'start { x:0 y:0 z:0 } size { x:250 y:250 z:250 }' \
            --model_checkpoint_path /tmp/poisoned_model/model.ckpt-XXXX # Replace XXXX with the latest checkpoint number
          ```
    3. **Verification**:
        - Compare the segmentation results from the model trained with poisoned data against the results from a model trained with legitimate data.
        - Observe if the poisoned model exhibits flawed segmentation patterns, especially in areas related to the manipulated data in `malicious_data.h5`.
        - If the segmentation is noticeably incorrect or biased in a way that reflects the data poisoning attempt, the vulnerability is confirmed.
