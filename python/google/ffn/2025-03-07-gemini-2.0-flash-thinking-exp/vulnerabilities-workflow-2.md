## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability 1: Unvalidated Input Paths Leading to Data Poisoning in Data Preparation Scripts

- **Description:**
    1. The `compute_partitions.py` and `build_coordinates.py` scripts, used for data preparation, accept file paths for input volumes via command-line arguments (`--input_volume` and `--partition_volumes` respectively).
    2. These scripts directly use the provided paths to open HDF5 files without any validation or sanitization.
    3. An attacker can manipulate these input path arguments to point to a malicious HDF5 file hosted on a location controlled by the attacker or even a local malicious file.
    4. If a malicious HDF5 file is provided, the scripts will read data from it as if it were legitimate input data.
    5. By crafting a malicious HDF5 file with poisoned data (e.g., incorrect segmentation labels or partition data), the attacker can inject this poisoned data into the generated TFRecord files (coordinates) used for training the FFN model.
    6. Consequently, the `train.py` script will train the FFN model using the poisoned data, leading to a compromised model.

- **Impact:**
    - The FFN model will be trained on data poisoned by the attacker, resulting in inaccurate or biased instance segmentation.
    - In neuroscience applications, this can lead to misinterpretation of brain tissue data, potentially causing misidentification of neuronal structures or flawed analysis.
    - The consequences could be severe in research or diagnostic contexts where accurate segmentation is crucial, leading to incorrect conclusions or diagnoses.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The scripts directly utilize the provided file paths without any form of validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Path Validation:** Implement robust checks to validate that the provided input paths point to expected and trusted locations or data sources. This could involve whitelisting allowed directories or sources.
    - **Data Validation:** Implement checks to verify the integrity and format of the data read from the input HDF5 files. This could include schema validation to ensure the data structure is as expected and checks for anomalous data patterns that might indicate poisoning.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to influence the arguments passed to `compute_partitions.py` or `build_coordinates.py`. This could occur in scenarios where:
        - The scripts are part of an automated pipeline where input paths are configurable and exposed to external influence.
        - An attacker can convince a user to execute the scripts with maliciously crafted arguments, for example, by providing a configuration file or command-line parameters.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`compute_partitions.py`:**
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_string('input_volume', None,
                            'Segmentation volume as <volume_path>:<dataset>, where'
                            'volume_path points to a HDF5 volume.')
        ...
        def main(argv):
          del argv  # Unused.
          path, dataset = FLAGS.input_volume.split(':') # [VULNERABLE LINE]
          with h5py.File(path) as f: # [VULNERABLE LINE]
            segmentation = f[dataset]
            ...
        ```
        The code directly splits the `FLAGS.input_volume` string to extract the `path` and dataset name. The `path` variable is then directly used to open the HDF5 file using `h5py.File(path)` without any validation to ensure it points to a trusted or expected location.

    - **`build_coordinates.py`:**
        ```python
        flags.DEFINE_list('partition_volumes', None,
                          'Partition volumes as '
                          '<volume_name>:<volume_path>:<dataset>, where volume_path '
                          'points to a HDF5 volume, and <volume_name> is an arbitrary '
                          'label that will have to also be used during training.')
        ...
        def main(argv):
          del argv  # Unused.
          ...
          for i, partvol in enumerate(FLAGS.partition_volumes):
            name, path, dataset = partvol.split(':') # [VULNERABLE LINE]
            with h5py.File(path, 'r') as f: # [VULNERABLE LINE]
              partitions = f[dataset][mz:-mz, my:-mx]
              ...
        ```
        Similarly, `build_coordinates.py` splits the `FLAGS.partition_volumes` string list and extracts the `path` for each partition volume. These `path` variables are then directly used to open HDF5 files using `h5py.File(path, 'r')` without any validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a standard FFN project environment.
        - Create a malicious HDF5 file named `malicious_data.h5` and place it in `/tmp/malicious_data.h5`. This file should contain poisoned partition data within a dataset (e.g., named `af`) mimicking the expected structure of legitimate partition volumes. The content should be crafted to cause a noticeable effect on the segmentation output after training.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Execute `build_coordinates.py` with the `--partition_volumes` argument pointing to the malicious HDF5 file:
          ```shell
          python build_coordinates.py \
             --partition_volumes validation1:/tmp/malicious_data.h5:af \
             --coordinate_output /tmp/poisoned_coords.tfrecord \
             --margin 24,24,24
          ```
        - Execute `train.py` using the generated poisoned coordinate file (`/tmp/poisoned_coords.tfrecord`) along with legitimate data and label volumes (e.g., example data from the repository):
          ```shell
          python train.py \
            --train_coords /tmp/poisoned_coords.tfrecord \
            --data_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/grayscale_maps.h5:raw \
            --label_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/groundtruth.h5:stack \
            --model_name convstack_3d.ConvStack3DFFNModel \
            --model_args "{\"depth\": 12, \"fov_size\": [33, 33, 33], \"deltas\": [8, 8, 8]}" \
            --image_mean 128 \
            --image_stddev 33 \
            --train_dir /tmp/poisoned_model
          ```
        - Run inference using `run_inference.py` with the model trained on poisoned data (`/tmp/poisoned_model`) and a sample inference request configuration.
          ```shell
          python run_inference.py \
            --inference_request="$(cat configs/inference_training_sample2.pbtxt)" \
            --bounding_box 'start { x:0 y:0 z:0 } size { x:250 y:250 z:250 }' \
            --model_checkpoint_path /tmp/poisoned_model/model.ckpt-XXXX # Replace XXXX with the latest checkpoint number
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - Compare the segmentation results obtained from the model trained with poisoned data to the results from a model trained using only legitimate data.
        - Observe if the model trained with poisoned data exhibits flawed segmentation patterns, particularly in areas related to the manipulated data within `malicious_data.h5`. If the segmentation is demonstrably incorrect or biased in a way that aligns with the data poisoning attempt, the vulnerability is confirmed.

### Vulnerability 2: Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Path Arguments Across Multiple Scripts

- **Description:**
    1. Multiple Python scripts within the Flood-Filling Networks application (`run_inference.py`, `train.py`, `build_coordinates.py`, `compute_partitions.py`) accept file paths as command-line arguments to specify input and output data locations.
    2. These scripts directly use these user-provided file paths without sufficient validation or sanitization.
    3. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious file paths containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the command-line arguments.
    4. By injecting path traversal sequences, an attacker can potentially access files and directories outside of the intended working directory of the application.
    5. This vulnerability exists in various file path arguments across different scripts, including but not limited to:
        - `--inference_request` and `segmentation_output_dir` in `run_inference.py`
        - `--data_volumes`, `--label_volumes`, `--train_coords`, and `--train_dir` in `train.py`
        - `--partition_volumes` and `--coordinate_output` in `build_coordinates.py`
        - `--input_volume` and `--output_volume` in `compute_partitions.py`

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system by crafting malicious input paths. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, or even source code. For example, an attacker could attempt to read `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files.
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** In contexts where output paths are specified (e.g., `--output_volume`, `--coordinate_output`, `segmentation_output_dir`, `--train_dir`), an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This could allow overwriting critical system files, injecting malicious code, or placing files in sensitive directories.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. There is no evident path sanitization or validation implemented for any of the file path arguments in the vulnerable scripts. The scripts directly use user-supplied paths in file system operations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Path Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive path sanitization for all file path arguments across all relevant Python scripts. This should include:
        - **Absolute Path Conversion:** Convert user-supplied paths to absolute paths using `os.path.abspath()` to resolve relative paths.
        - **Path Canonicalization:** Canonicalize paths using `os.path.realpath()` or `os.path.normpath()` to remove symbolic links, redundant separators, and path traversal components like `..`.
        - **Input Validation and Whitelisting:** Validate that the resulting canonicalized paths are within expected or whitelisted directories. Define allowed base directories for inputs and outputs and ensure that all accessed paths fall under these directories.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The Flood-Filling Networks application must be deployed and accessible.
    - An attacker must be able to provide or influence command-line arguments to the vulnerable Python scripts, either directly through a command-line interface or indirectly via a web interface or configuration mechanism that passes user-supplied paths to the scripts.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **General Pattern:** Across all mentioned scripts (`run_inference.py`, `train.py`, `build_coordinates.py`, `compute_partitions.py`), the common vulnerability pattern is the direct usage of `FLAGS.<path_flag>` variables with file system functions like `gfile.exists`, `gfile.makedirs`, `h5py.File`, `tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter`, and `inputs.load_patch_coordinates` without any prior path validation or sanitization.

    - **Examples:**
        - **`run_inference.py`:** `request.segmentation_output_dir` is used directly with `gfile.makedirs` and `os.path.join`.
        - **`build_coordinates.py`:** `FLAGS.partition_volumes` and `FLAGS.coordinate_output` are directly used with `h5py.File` and `tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter` respectively.
        - **`compute_partitions.py`:** `FLAGS.input_volume` and `FLAGS.output_volume` are directly used with `h5py.File`.
        - **`train.py`:** `FLAGS.train_coords`, `FLAGS.data_volumes`, `FLAGS.label_volumes`, and `FLAGS.train_dir` are used directly with `inputs.load_patch_coordinates`, `h5py.File`, `gfile.exists`, and `gfile.makedirs`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Set up a standard FFN environment.
    2. **Test 1: Arbitrary File Read (via `run_inference.py` - `inference_request`)**
        - Create a malicious inference request file `malicious_inference.pbtxt` with a path traversal payload in the `image.volume_path` field:
          ```
          image {
            volume_path: "../../etc/passwd:dataset_name"
          }
          segmentation_output_dir: "/tmp/output_dir" # harmless output path
          model_name: "convstack_3d.ConvStack3DFFNModel"
          model_args: "{\"depth\": 12, \"fov_size\": [33, 33, 33], \"deltas\": [8, 8, 8]}"
          inference_options {
            init_activation: 0.95
            pad_value: 0.05
            move_threshold: 0.9
          }
          ```
        - Run `run_inference.py` with this malicious configuration:
          ```shell
          python run_inference.py --inference_request="malicious_inference.pbtxt" --bounding_box 'start { x:0 y:0 z:0 } size { x:10 y:10 z:10 }'
          ```
        - Observe if the application attempts to access or read `/etc/passwd`. Error messages related to file access or attempts to process `/etc/passwd` as an HDF5 file would indicate successful path traversal.

    3. **Test 2: Arbitrary File Write (via `build_coordinates.py` - `coordinate_output`)**
        - Run `build_coordinates.py` with a malicious `--coordinate_output` path:
          ```shell
          python build_coordinates.py \
             --partition_volumes validation1:third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/af.h5:af \
             --coordinate_output "/tmp/../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_coords" \
             --margin 24,24,24
          ```
        - Check if a file named `evil_coords` is created in the `/tmp` directory. If it is, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability leading to arbitrary file write.

### Vulnerability 3: Path Traversal in Segmentation Output Directory in `run_inference.py`

- **Description:**
    1. The `run_inference.py` script utilizes the `segmentation_output_dir` parameter from the inference request configuration file (`.pbtxt`) to determine where to save the segmentation results.
    2. The script directly uses this `segmentation_output_dir` value to create the output directory and construct paths for output files using functions like `gfile.makedirs` and `os.path.join`.
    3. If an attacker provides a malicious path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) as the value for `segmentation_output_dir` in the inference request file, the script might create directories and write files outside the intended output directory.
    4. This path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to control the output location of segmentation results.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write segmentation results to arbitrary locations on the server's file system. This could be exploited to:
        - Overwrite critical system files, potentially leading to system instability or denial of service.
        - Place files in sensitive directories, potentially gaining unauthorized access or escalating privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities.
        - Write large amounts of data to fill up disk space, potentially leading to denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `run_inference.py` script directly uses the `segmentation_output_dir` value from the configuration without any validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation and sanitization for the `segmentation_output_dir` parameter in `run_inference.py`. This should include:
        - Validating that the path is relative to the intended base output directory and does not contain path traversal sequences like `..`.
        - Using secure path joining functions that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        - Consider using a chroot jail or similar sandboxing techniques to restrict the script's file system access to a specific directory.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to provide a crafted inference request configuration file (`.pbtxt`) to the `run_inference.py` script.
    - The `run_inference.py` script must be executed using this attacker-provided configuration file.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/run_inference.py`:
        ```python
        request = inference_flags.request_from_flags()

        if not gfile.exists(request.segmentation_output_dir):
            gfile.makedirs(request.segmentation_output_dir)

        ...
        counter_path = os.path.join(request.segmentation_output_dir, 'counters.txt')
        ```
    - The code retrieves `request.segmentation_output_dir` from the parsed inference request.
    - It directly uses `request.segmentation_output_dir` as an argument to `gfile.makedirs` to create the output directory and subsequently uses it with `os.path.join` to construct file paths within this directory.
    - There is no sanitization or validation of `request.segmentation_output_dir` before these operations, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Set up a standard FFN environment.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Create a malicious inference request configuration file named `malicious_inference.pbtxt` with the following content, specifically setting `segmentation_output_dir` to a path traversal string:
          ```
          image {
            volume_path: "third_party/neuroproof_examples/validation_sample/grayscale_maps.h5:raw"
          }
          segmentation_output_dir: "../../tmp/ffn_output"
          model_name: "convstack_3d.ConvStack3DFFNModel"
          model_args: "{\"depth\": 12, \"fov_size\": [33, 33, 33], \"deltas\": [8, 8, 8]}"
          inference_options {
            init_activation: 0.95
            pad_value: 0.05
            move_threshold: 0.9
          }
          ```
        - Run the `run_inference.py` script with this malicious configuration:
          ```shell
          python run_inference.py --inference_request="$(cat malicious_inference.pbtxt)" --bounding_box 'start { x:0 y:0 z:0 } size { x:10 y:10 z:0 }'
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - After the script execution completes, check if a directory named `ffn_output` has been created in the `/tmp` directory.
        - If the `ffn_output` directory is found in `/tmp`, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as the intended output directory should have been within the project's designated results directory or a subdirectory within it, not in `/tmp`.
        - Further tests can be conducted by modifying `segmentation_output_dir` to attempt writing to other locations (within `/tmp` for testing safety), demonstrating the extent of the path traversal vulnerability. For example, try `segmentation_output_dir: "../../tmp/sensitive_dir/ffn_output"` to see if the directory is created under `/tmp/sensitive_dir`.
