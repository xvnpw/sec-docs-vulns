### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Configuration Update via `/updateConfig` Endpoint

- Description:
    1. An attacker discovers the publicly accessible Cloud Run service URL for the Project Cartesian application.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious Google Sheet containing modified configuration parameters. For example, the attacker might change `output_google_sheet_name` to a Google Sheet they control, or modify other parameters like `mc_fields` or `attribute_filters` to manipulate data processing.
    3. The attacker constructs a URL targeting the `/updateConfig` endpoint, appending the `sheet_name` parameter with the name of their malicious Google Sheet: `https://CLOUD_RUN_URL/updateConfig?sheet_name=ATTACKER_CONTROLLED_SHEET_NAME`.
    4. The attacker sends an unauthenticated GET request to this crafted URL using `curl`, a web browser, or any HTTP client.
    5. The `/updateConfig` endpoint processes the request without any authentication or authorization checks.
    6. The application fetches the configuration from the attacker's Google Sheet, parses it, and updates the application's runtime configuration, including overwriting the `config.json` file.
    7. The application now operates with the attacker-injected configuration, potentially leading to data exfiltration to the attacker's Google Sheet, manipulation of advertising feeds, or other unintended and malicious behaviors depending on the scope of the configuration parameters modified by the attacker.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation allows an attacker to arbitrarily modify the application's configuration. This can lead to:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Redirecting output data (e.g., generated advertising feeds) to an attacker-controlled Google Sheet, enabling unauthorized data collection.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Altering data processing parameters to corrupt or manipulate the generated advertising feeds, potentially damaging advertising campaigns or brand reputation.
    - **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Depending on the nature of configurable parameters and application logic, it might be possible to escalate the impact further, potentially even leading to code execution if the configuration is processed insecurely (though not immediately evident in the provided code, this remains a risk depending on future code evolution).
    - **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By misconfiguring critical parameters, an attacker could disrupt the application's functionality, leading to an indirect denial of service.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The `/updateConfig` endpoint is exposed without any authentication or authorization mechanisms.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the `/updateConfig` endpoint by implementing robust authentication and authorization. Verify the identity of the requester and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts are permitted to update the application configuration. Consider using:
        - **API Keys:** Require a secret API key to be passed in the request header or as a query parameter.
        - **OAuth 2.0:** Integrate with an OAuth 2.0 provider to authenticate and authorize configuration update requests.
        - **Service Account Verification:** If the application runs within a Google Cloud environment, verify the identity of the calling service account if the configuration update is intended to be triggered by another GCP service.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input validation for the `sheet_name` parameter and all configuration data read from the Google Sheet. This should include:
        - **`sheet_name` Validation:**  Validate that the `sheet_name` conforms to expected patterns and potentially whitelist allowed sheet names to prevent access to arbitrary sheets.
        - **Configuration Data Validation:**  For each configuration parameter read from the sheet, enforce strict validation rules to ensure that the data type, format, and values are within expected bounds. Reject configurations that do not pass validation.
        - **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize configuration data before using it within the application to prevent injection attacks or other unintended behaviors.

- Preconditions:
    - The Project Cartesian application is deployed as a Cloud Run service and its service URL is publicly accessible.
    - An attacker is able to discover or guess the Cloud Run service URL.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `/code/main.py`: The `/updateConfig` route is defined in the `configure()` function.
    2. `sheet=request.args.get("sheet_name")` retrieves the `sheet_name` directly from the request query parameters without any validation or sanitization.
    3. `_load_config(sheet)` is called to load configuration from the specified Google Sheet.
    4. The `configure()` function and `_load_config()` are executed without any authentication or authorization checks to verify the identity and permissions of the requester.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the Project Cartesian application to a test Google Cloud environment (Cloud Run).
    2. Obtain the Cloud Run service URL for the deployed application (e.g., from the Cloud Console).
    3. Create a new Google Sheet named `attacker-config-sheet` (or any name of your choice) in a Google account controlled by the attacker.
    4. In `attacker-config-sheet`, populate the first sheet (Sheet1) with configuration data intended to be malicious. At minimum, include the headers expected by the configuration loading logic (as seen in a legitimate configuration sheet or `config.json`). For a basic test, you could try to change the `output_google_sheet_name` to a sheet you control.
    5. Construct a malicious URL by appending the `/updateConfig` endpoint to the Cloud Run service URL and adding the `sheet_name` parameter set to `attacker-config-sheet`: `https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/updateConfig?sheet_name=attacker-config-sheet`.
    6. Send a GET request to this malicious URL using `curl` or a web browser.
    7. After sending the request, check the application's behavior. For example, if you changed `output_google_sheet_name`, subsequent executions of the main Cartesian function (`/execute` endpoint) should now write output to the attacker-specified Google Sheet instead of the intended one.
    8. To further verify, examine the logs of the Cloud Run service. You may see log messages indicating that the configuration has been updated and potentially errors if the malicious configuration caused issues, or successful execution with unintended output location.
