### Vulnerability 1: Configuration Sheet Injection

* Vulnerability Name: Configuration Sheet Injection
* Description:
    An attacker can compromise the application by manipulating the optional configuration Google Sheet. The application's `/updateConfig` endpoint allows users to update the configuration by providing a Google Sheet name as a parameter. If an attacker gains knowledge of the Cloud Run endpoint URL, they can create a malicious Google Sheet with altered configurations and provide its name to the `/updateConfig` endpoint. The application will then fetch this malicious configuration and overwrite its local `config.json` file and in-memory parameters. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary configurations into the application.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  Attacker creates a Google Sheet containing malicious configurations. This could include changing the `output_google_sheet_name` to a sheet controlled by the attacker, or modifying other parameters like `bigquery_dataset`, `mc_fields`, or `attribute_filters` to alter data processing.
    2.  Attacker obtains the Cloud Run endpoint URL of the Project Cartesian instance. This URL might be discoverable through misconfiguration or information disclosure.
    3.  Attacker crafts a malicious URL by appending the `/updateConfig` endpoint path to the Cloud Run URL and adding a query parameter `sheet_name` set to the name of their malicious Google Sheet. For example: `https://CLOUD_RUN_ENDPOINT/updateConfig?sheet_name=ATTACKER_CONTROLLED_SHEET_NAME`.
    4.  Attacker sends a request to this crafted URL, for instance by using `curl` or simply opening the URL in a web browser.
    5.  The Project Cartesian application, upon receiving this request, will use the provided `sheet_name` to fetch the configuration from the attacker's Google Sheet, replacing its intended configuration.
    6.  When the application next executes its main function (either via scheduled run or manual trigger of `/execute`), it will operate using the attacker-injected malicious configuration.

* Impact:
    The impact of this vulnerability is significant:
    -   **Data Redirection/Exfiltration**: By modifying the `output_google_sheet_name` parameter in the malicious configuration sheet, the attacker can redirect the output of the data processing to a Google Sheet under their control. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from the Google Merchant Center, intended for the legitimate user's Google Sheet, to their own sheet.
    -   **Data Manipulation**: The attacker can alter other configuration parameters, such as `mc_fields`, `additional_columns`, and `attribute_filters`. This could lead to unintended or malicious modifications of the data processing logic. For example, the attacker could alter the columns included in the output feed, inject fabricated data through `additional_columns`, or filter out legitimate data by modifying `attribute_filters`. This could compromise the integrity of the dynamic creative feeds generated by Project Cartesian, leading to incorrect or misleading advertisements.

* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    There are no mitigations implemented in the provided project files to prevent this vulnerability. The `/updateConfig` endpoint directly loads and applies any Google Sheet configuration provided via the `sheet_name` parameter without any validation, authorization, or sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    -   **Input Validation for `sheet_name`**: The application should validate the `sheet_name` parameter to ensure it adheres to an expected format and does not contain malicious characters or excessively long names.
    -   **Configuration Validation**: After fetching the configuration from the Google Sheet, the application should validate the critical configuration parameters. This validation should include checks against expected data types, allowed values, and consistency. For example, it should verify that `output_google_sheet_name` is a valid sheet name, BigQuery dataset and table names conform to naming conventions, and Merchant Center ID is in the correct format. A whitelist of allowed values or a schema validation could be implemented.
    -   **Access Control for `/updateConfig` Endpoint**: The `/updateConfig` endpoint should be protected with authentication and authorization mechanisms. This would ensure that only authorized users (e.g., administrators) can trigger configuration updates. Currently, the endpoint appears to be publicly accessible, making it vulnerable to anyone who discovers the Cloud Run URL.
    -   **Principle of Least Privilege Review**: Re-evaluate the permissions granted to the service account used by Project Cartesian. While the setup instructions suggest granting the "editor" role to the service account for the configuration sheet, it's crucial to assess if this level of permission is necessary. If only read access to the configuration sheet is required, granting the "reader" role would reduce the potential impact of compromised service account credentials. However, based on the setup instructions involving modifying the configuration sheet, "editor" role might be intended for legitimate configuration updates, but needs to be coupled with access control on `/updateConfig` endpoint.

* Preconditions:
    -   Attacker must be able to create and modify a Google Sheet.
    -   Attacker must obtain the Cloud Run endpoint URL for the Project Cartesian instance. This might be achieved through reconnaissance, misconfiguration, or accidental exposure.
    -   The service account used by Project Cartesian must have "editor" role on Google Sheets, or at least "reader" role to fetch the malicious configuration. The setup instructions explicitly require sharing the configuration sheet with "editor" role.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **Endpoint Definition**: In `main.py`, the `/updateConfig` endpoint is defined as a Flask route:
        ```python
        @app.route("/updateConfig")
        def configure():
            """
            Reads a google sheet by name with the configuration translates it to json writes it to file and global variables
            Returns the new configuration as a json.
            """
            try:
              sheet=request.args.get("sheet_name")
              line=_load_config(sheet)
              return line
            except Exception as e:
              print(e)
              return "Loading Unsuccesful!"
        ```
        This endpoint directly calls the `_load_config` function with the `sheet_name` parameter obtained from the request arguments. There is no input validation on `sheet_name` at this stage.

    2.  **`_load_config` Function**: The `_load_config` function in `main.py` is responsible for fetching and loading the configuration from the Google Sheet:
        ```python
        def _load_config(input_google_sheet_name:str)-> str:
            """
            Takes a google sheets name, transforms to json and updates configuration file and current variables
                params:
                    input_google_sheet_name: String with the google sheets name.

                returns:
                    New configuration json

            """

            global params
            global merchant_center_fields
            credentials, project_id = google.auth.default(
                scopes=GOOGLE_SHEETS_AUTH_SCOPES
            )
            client = gspread.authorize(credentials)
            try:
              spreadsheet=client.open(input_google_sheet_name)
            except gspread.exceptions.SpreadsheetNotFound :
              print("Configuration sheet does not exist!...")
              return "Configuration sheet does not exist!... Not updated"
            worksheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet(0)
            list_of_lists = worksheet.get_all_values()
            config_json=_transform_config_to_json(list_of_lists)
            params=config_json
            merchant_center_fields=params["mc_fields"]
            f = open("config.json", "w")
            json.dump(config_json, f)
            f.close()
            a_file = open("config.json","r")
            Lines = a_file.readlines()
            for line in Lines:
              print(line)
            a_file.close()
            return line
        ```
        -   It retrieves the `input_google_sheet_name` which is directly passed from the `/updateConfig` endpoint's `sheet` variable.
        -   It authenticates with Google Sheets using service account credentials.
        -   Crucially, it uses `client.open(input_google_sheet_name)` to open the Google Sheet *without any validation* of the sheet name. This allows an attacker to provide any valid Google Sheet name.
        -   It fetches all values from the sheet and transforms them into a JSON object.
        -   It overwrites the local `config.json` file with this fetched configuration and updates the global `params` and `merchant_center_fields` variables.

    3.  **Configuration Usage**: The global `params` variable, populated by `_load_config`, is used throughout the `main_cartesian` function and other parts of the application to control data processing, output destinations, and other critical functionalities. This means that any malicious configuration injected through the `/updateConfig` endpoint will directly influence the application's behavior in subsequent executions.

* Security Test Case:
    1.  **Setup Attacker-Controlled Sheet**:
        -   Create a new Google Sheet. This will be the attacker's malicious configuration sheet.
        -   In the first sheet of this new Google Sheet (Sheet1), create two columns: "Parameter" and "Value".
        -   In the "Parameter" column, add the key `output_google_sheet_name`.
        -   In the "Value" column, put the name of a Google Sheet that you (as the attacker) control. Let's call this sheet "AttackerOutputSheet". Share "AttackerOutputSheet" with your attacker account with editor role.
        -   Make sure the "AttackerOutputSheet" exists and is empty initially.
        -   Optionally, add other malicious configurations to this sheet, like modifying `mc_fields` or `attribute_filters` to further manipulate data processing. For this test case, changing `output_google_sheet_name` is sufficient.
        -   Get the name of your attacker-controlled Google Sheet. Let's assume it is "MaliciousConfigSheet".

    2.  **Get Cloud Run Endpoint**:
        -   Obtain the Cloud Run endpoint URL for the deployed Project Cartesian instance. You can find this in the Cloud Console by navigating to Cloud Run and selecting your Cartesian service. Let's assume the Cloud Run URL is `https://projectcartesian-xyz-uc.a.run.app`.

    3.  **Exploit Execution**:
        -   Craft the malicious URL to update the configuration: `https://projectcartesian-xyz-uc.a.run.app/updateConfig?sheet_name=MaliciousConfigSheet`.
        -   Execute this URL. You can do this by pasting it into a web browser or using `curl` in a terminal:
            ```bash
            curl "https://projectcartesian-xyz-uc.a.run.app/updateConfig?sheet_name=MaliciousConfigSheet"
            ```
        -   This will trigger the `/updateConfig` endpoint and load the configuration from "MaliciousConfigSheet", overwriting the application's configuration.

    4.  **Trigger Data Processing**:
        -   Trigger the Project Cartesian data processing. You can do this by manually calling the `/execute` endpoint:
            ```bash
            curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" "https://projectcartesian-xyz-uc.a.run.app/execute"
            ```
            Alternatively, if you have a scheduled Cloud Scheduler job configured to run Project Cartesian, wait for the next scheduled run.

    5.  **Verify Data Redirection**:
        -   Check the "AttackerOutputSheet" Google Sheet.
        -   Verify that the data feed generated by Project Cartesian has been written to "AttackerOutputSheet" instead of the original, intended output Google Sheet.
        -   If successful, the attacker has successfully redirected the data output using Configuration Sheet Injection.
