### SystemVerilog Code Injection via Comments

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input string that will be used as the text content for a comment within the generated SystemVerilog code.
    2. This input string is processed by a tool using the `imp-modeling-in-python` library to create a `comments.Comment` or `comments.BlockComment` object.
    3. The attacker's malicious input includes SystemVerilog code designed to break out of the comment context and inject executable code into the generated SystemVerilog output. For example, using comment delimiters like `*/` or `//` within the comment text can prematurely close the comment and allow subsequent text to be interpreted as active code.
    4. When the `comment_tokenizer` or `block_comment_tokenizer` in `imp/system_verilog/writers/comments_tokenizer.py` processes this comment object, it directly embeds the attacker-controlled text into a `Literal` token without sanitization.
    5. The `SystemVerilogWriter` then converts this sequence of tokens, including the unsanitized `Literal` token containing the malicious payload, into a SystemVerilog code string.
    6. Consequently, the generated SystemVerilog code includes the attacker's injected code, which can lead to unintended and potentially malicious hardware behavior when the generated code is used for hardware synthesis or simulation.

- **Impact:**
    - Hardware vulnerability injection: By injecting arbitrary SystemVerilog code, an attacker can introduce vulnerabilities directly into the hardware design. This could lead to a range of security issues, including unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or even physical damage to the hardware depending on the nature of the injected code and the system's context.
    - Supply chain compromise: If tools using this library are integrated into hardware design supply chains, this vulnerability could be exploited to inject malicious code into hardware designs that are distributed to multiple users or organizations, leading to widespread impact.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code generation process for comments in `imp/system_verilog/writers/comments_tokenizer.py` directly uses the input comment text without any form of sanitization or validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization of comment text inputs within the `comment_tokenizer` and `block_comment_tokenizer` functions. This should involve:
        - Escaping or removing SystemVerilog comment delimiters (`//`, `/*`, `*/`) within the input text to prevent premature comment termination.
        - Potentially, applying more comprehensive input validation to detect and neutralize any attempts to inject executable code through comments.
    - Secure Tokenization: Modify the tokenization process to treat comment content strictly as data, separate from SystemVerilog syntax, ensuring that malicious code within comments cannot be interpreted as executable code.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A tool or application must utilize the `imp-modeling-in-python` library to generate SystemVerilog code.
    - This tool must allow user-controlled or externally influenced input to be incorporated as comment text in the generated SystemVerilog code. This could occur through configuration files, command-line arguments, network inputs, or any other means where an attacker can manipulate the input data processed by the tool.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Vulnerable Code Location: `/code/imp/system_verilog/writers/comments_tokenizer.py`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      @tokenizer_for(comments.Comment)
      def comment_tokenizer(target: comments.Comment, tokenize):
        yield from Symbol("//") + SP() + Literal(target.txt)

      @tokenizer_for(comments.BlockComment)
      def block_comment_tokenizer(target: comments.BlockComment, tokenize):
        yield from Symbol("/*") + SP() + Literal(target.txt) + SP() + Symbol("*/")
      ```
    - Analysis:
        - The `comment_tokenizer` and `block_comment_tokenizer` functions are responsible for converting `comments.Comment` and `comments.BlockComment` model objects into SystemVerilog code tokens.
        - Both functions use `Literal(target.txt)` to create a token representing the comment's text content. The `Literal` token directly encapsulates the provided string without any modification or escaping.
        - If `target.txt` contains malicious SystemVerilog syntax, such as `*/` to prematurely close a block comment or `//` to start a new line comment within a line comment, this syntax will be passed directly into the generated SystemVerilog code.
        - Because there is no input validation or sanitization of `target.txt`, an attacker can inject arbitrary SystemVerilog code by crafting a malicious string and injecting it as a comment. The injected code can escape the comment context and be interpreted as executable SystemVerilog code.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a Python test script (e.g., `test_comment_injection.py`) using the `imp-modeling-in-python` library.
    2. Import necessary modules:
       ```python
       from imp.system_verilog.models import modules
       from imp.system_verilog.models import comments
       from imp.system_verilog.writers import systemverilog_writer
       ```
    3. Instantiate a `SystemVerilogWriter`:
       ```python
       writer = systemverilog_writer.SystemVerilogWriter()
       ```
    4. Create a `modules.Module` object:
       ```python
       test_module = modules.Module(module_name="injection_test")
       ```
    5. Craft a malicious comment string that attempts to inject SystemVerilog code by breaking out of the comment context. For example, to inject a wire declaration:
       ```python
       malicious_comment_text = "This is a comment with malicious code injection attempt */ wire injected_wire; /* Begin legitimate comment again"
       ```
    6. Create a `comments.BlockComment` object with the malicious text:
       ```python
       malicious_comment = comments.BlockComment(txt=malicious_comment_text)
       ```
    7. Add the malicious comment to the module:
       ```python
       test_module.items.append(malicious_comment)
       ```
    8. Generate SystemVerilog code from the module using `SystemVerilogWriter`:
       ```python
       generated_code = writer.get_text_for(test_module)
       ```
    9. Print or inspect the `generated_code` string.
    10. Verify that the generated SystemVerilog code contains the injected `wire injected_wire;` declaration outside of the intended comment block. The output should demonstrate that the comment was prematurely terminated by the malicious payload, and the subsequent text was interpreted as SystemVerilog code.

    ```python
    from imp.system_verilog.models import modules
    from imp.system_verilog.models import comments
    from imp.system_verilog.writers import systemverilog_writer

    writer = systemverilog_writer.SystemVerilogWriter()
    test_module = modules.Module(module_name="injection_test")
    malicious_comment_text = "This is a comment with malicious code injection attempt */ wire injected_wire; /* Begin legitimate comment again"
    malicious_comment = comments.BlockComment(txt=malicious_comment_text)
    test_module.items.append(malicious_comment)
    generated_code = writer.get_text_for(test_module)
    print(generated_code)
    ```
    - Expected Result: The generated `generated_code` will contain the line `wire injected_wire;` outside of the comment delimiters `/* ... */`, demonstrating successful code injection. The presence of `wire injected_wire;` as a wire declaration in the module's scope (not within a comment) confirms the vulnerability.
