### Command Injection in `proto_lib.py`

- Description:
    The `decode_protobuf` and `encode_protobuf` functions in `proto_lib.py` use `subprocess.Popen` to execute the `protoscope` command. The input to these functions, `proto_input`, which is derived from the request body, is passed directly as standard input to the `protoscope` process without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject shell commands into the `protoscope` command execution by crafting a malicious protobuf payload that contains shell metacharacters or commands.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious protobuf payload. This payload will be designed to be interpreted as a command when passed to the shell by `protoscope`. For example, the payload could contain shell command separators like `;`, `&`, or `|` followed by commands such as `whoami`, `ls -al`, or more harmful commands.
    2.  The attacker sends an HTTP request to a web application that is expected to process protobuf messages. The request body contains the crafted malicious protobuf payload. The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/octet-stream` or include `proto` to trigger the extension, or the payload should be enclosed within the defined markers `$$malicious_payload$$`.
    3.  Burp Suite, with the Protobuf Extensibility extension enabled, intercepts this request.
    4.  The extension identifies the request as containing a protobuf message (either via Content-Type or markers) and activates the Protobuf tab.
    5.  When the user interacts with the "Protobuf" tab or when Burp Suite processes the request, the extension calls either `decode_protobuf` or `encode_protobuf` from `proto_lib.py`.
    6.  The malicious protobuf payload (attacker-controlled `proto_input`) is passed to `subprocess.Popen` as standard input for the `protoscope` command without sanitization.
    7.  If `protoscope` or the underlying shell environment is vulnerable to command injection through standard input, the injected commands will be executed on the server where Burp Suite is running.

- Impact:
    Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite. This could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the Burp Suite user's machine.
    *   Modify files or configurations on the Burp Suite user's machine.
    *   Install malware or backdoors on the Burp Suite user's machine.
    *   Pivot further into the network from the Burp Suite user's machine.
    *   Potentially compromise the security tester's system, which is a critical impact in a security assessment context.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    There are no mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent command injection. The `proto_lib.py` directly passes the user-controlled input to the shell command without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Input Sanitization:** The `proto_input` should be sanitized before being passed to `subprocess.Popen`. This could involve escaping shell metacharacters or validating the input to ensure it only contains expected protobuf data. However, sanitizing protobuf data to prevent command injection when it's processed by `protoscope` might be complex and error-prone.
    *   **Using `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and passing arguments as a list:**  Instead of using `subprocess.Popen` with a string command, `subprocess.run` should be used with `shell=False` and the command and its arguments passed as a list. This avoids shell interpretation of the input. However, `protoscope` is called as a single command "protoscope" without arguments in the code, and the input is passed via stdin. If `protoscope` itself interprets stdin as commands, this might not fully mitigate the issue.  It's crucial to understand how `protoscope` handles standard input.
    *   **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Running `protoscope` in a sandboxed environment or container could limit the impact of command injection, but this is a more complex mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation based on Protobuf Schema:** Ideally, the extension should validate the input against a known protobuf schema. If the schema is known, the extension could parse and serialize the protobuf message in a safe manner, instead of relying on external tools like `protoscope` that might introduce vulnerabilities. However, the extension is designed to handle unknown protobufs, making schema-based validation challenging in all cases.

- Preconditions:
    1.  Burp Suite is installed and running with the Protobuf Extensibility extension loaded.
    2.  The `protoscope` tool is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
    3.  The target web application processes protobuf messages and is accessible to the attacker.
    4.  The attacker can craft HTTP requests to the target application and intercept them with Burp Suite.
    5.  The attacker needs to trigger the extension to process the malicious payload, which can be done by setting the `Content-Type` header appropriately or using the defined markers in the request body.
    6.  The user interacts with the "Protobuf" tab in Burp Suite or the extension processes the message in some automated way that triggers the vulnerable code path.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **File: `/code/proto_lib.py`**
    2.  **Functions:** `decode_protobuf(proto_input)` and `encode_protobuf(proto_input)`
    3.  **Vulnerable Code Snippet (in both functions):**
        ```python
        p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"],
                             stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
        ```
    4.  **Analysis:**
        *   `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"], ...)`: This line executes the `protoscope` command. The command is provided as a list `["protoscope"]`, which is safer than a string when `shell=False` (though `shell=False` is implicit here). However, the vulnerability lies in how `proto_input` is handled.
        *   `stdin=subprocess.PIPE`:  Standard input for the `protoscope` process is set to a pipe.
        *   `p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]`: The `proto_input` is passed as input to the `protoscope` command via the standard input pipe. **Crucially, `proto_input` is not sanitized or validated before being passed to `protoscope`. If `proto_input` contains shell commands or metacharacters that `protoscope` (or the shell it might invoke internally) interprets, command injection can occur.**
    5.  **Visualization:**

        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure Burp Suite, Protobuf Extensibility extension, and `protoscope` are installed and configured as described in the extension's README.
    2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a malicious protobuf payload that attempts to execute a simple command like `whoami`. Since we are passing this as standard input to `protoscope`, the exact way to inject commands depends on how `protoscope` processes its input. A simple attempt could be to embed shell commands directly in the protobuf data. Let's try injecting a newline followed by a shell command.  A possible crafted payload could be:
        ```
        1: "test\nwhoami > /tmp/pwned"
        ```
        This attempts to create a protobuf message with field 1 set to "test" followed by a newline and the shell command `whoami > /tmp/pwned`.  The goal is to see if `protoscope`, when processing this input, will execute `whoami > /tmp/pwned`.

    3.  **Set up Burp Suite:**
        *   Start Burp Suite and load the Protobuf Extensibility extension.
        *   Ensure Burp Proxy is running and intercepting traffic.

    4.  **Send Malicious Request:**
        *   Use Burp Repeater or another tool to send an HTTP request.
        *   Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/octet-stream` or include `proto` to activate the extension, or enclose the payload with markers. For simplicity, let's use `application/octet-stream`.
        *   Set the request body to the crafted malicious protobuf payload (encoded as bytes if necessary, depending on how you are sending the request). For example, if sending raw bytes: `echo -e '1: "test\\nwhoami > /tmp/pwned"' | protoscope -s | xxd -p -r` to get the encoded protobuf.  Or try sending the text directly to see if `protoscope` processes it.
        *   Send the request to a target web application (it doesn't need to be a real vulnerable application, just a placeholder to trigger Burp extension).

    5.  **Trigger Extension Processing:**
        *   In Burp Suite, go to the "Protobuf" tab for the intercepted request. This should force the extension to decode the protobuf. Alternatively, just letting the request pass through Burp might be enough if the extension processes requests automatically.

    6.  **Verify Command Execution:**
        *   After sending the request and triggering the extension, check if the command `whoami > /tmp/pwned` was executed. In a Linux environment, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists and contains the output of the `whoami` command.
        *   If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created and contains the username, it confirms that command injection was successful.

    7.  **Refinement (if initial test fails):**
        *   If the initial payload doesn't work, experiment with different shell injection techniques and payloads. Try different command separators, encodings, and commands.
        *   Investigate how `protoscope` processes standard input to identify the exact injection point and syntax.
        *   If direct command injection via protobuf content doesn't work, consider if `protoscope` might be vulnerable to command injection via filenames or other parameters if it processes protobuf definitions or schema files (though this is not apparent from the current code, it's worth considering if further investigation into `protoscope` is needed). In the current code, it seems the vulnerability is directly through the protobuf data itself being passed as stdin.

### Path Traversal/Arbitrary Command Execution via `protoscope` PATH Manipulation

- Description:
    1. The Burp extension relies on an external tool called `protoscope` to decode and encode protobuf messages.
    2. The `proto_lib.py` script uses `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", ...])` and `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", "-s", ...])` to execute `protoscope` for decoding and encoding, respectively.
    3. The code assumes that `protoscope` is available in the system's PATH environment variable.
    4. If a malicious actor can control or influence the system's PATH environment variable when Burp Suite is launched (e.g., by compromising the user's environment or through social engineering to get the user to run Burp Suite in a modified environment), they could potentially replace the legitimate `protoscope` executable with a malicious one.
    5. When the Burp extension calls `protoscope` via `subprocess.Popen`, it would unknowingly execute the malicious `protoscope` instead of the intended legitimate tool.
    6. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite, with the privileges of the Burp Suite process.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control of the security tester's machine by replacing `protoscope` with a malicious executable that performs actions like installing malware, exfiltrating data, or further compromising the system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension relies on the system's PATH and does not validate the `protoscope` executable.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strong Mitigation:** Instead of relying on PATH, the extension should allow users to configure the full path to the `protoscope` executable in the extension settings. This way, the extension would always use the explicitly specified path, regardless of the system's PATH environment variable.
    - **Medium Mitigation:** Validate the `protoscope` executable. Before executing `protoscope`, the extension could perform checks to verify that the executable at the resolved PATH location is indeed the legitimate `protoscope` tool. This could involve checking file signatures, hashes, or locations. However, this is complex and might not be foolproof.
    - **Documentation Mitigation:** Clearly document the security implications of adding `protoscope` to the system's PATH in the extension's README and installation instructions. Warn users about the risks and recommend installing `protoscope` in a secure location and ensuring that no malicious executables are present in directories listed earlier in the PATH.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to influence the PATH environment variable on the system where Burp Suite is run *before* Burp Suite is launched with the Protobuf extension. This could be achieved through various means, including:
        - Compromising the user's system and modifying environment variables.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into running Burp Suite in a modified environment (e.g., running Burp from a shell with a manipulated PATH).
    - The user must have installed the Protobuf extension and be using it.
    - The extension must attempt to execute `protoscope` (e.g., by processing a protobuf request/response in the Protobuf tab).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`proto_lib.py:decode_protobuf(proto_input)`**:
        ```python
        def decode_protobuf(proto_input):
            p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"],
                                 stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
            stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
            return stdout
        ```
    2.  **`proto_lib.py:encode_protobuf(proto_input)`**:
        ```python
        def encode_protobuf(proto_input):
            p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", "-s"],
                                 stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
            stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
            return stdout
        ```
        - Both `decode_protobuf` and `encode_protobuf` functions use `subprocess.Popen` to execute `protoscope`.
        - The first argument to `Popen` is a list containing the command and its arguments. In both cases, the command is simply `"protoscope"` or `["protoscope", "-s"]`.
        - `subprocess.Popen` with a list as the first argument will search for the executable named "protoscope" in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
        - If a malicious executable named `protoscope` is placed in a directory that appears earlier in the PATH than the legitimate `protoscope` installation directory, `subprocess.Popen` will execute the malicious one.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the Protobuf extension in Burp Suite.
        - **Create a malicious `protoscope` executable:** Create a simple script (e.g., Python, Bash, or a compiled executable) named `protoscope`. This script should perform a malicious action, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory or making a network request to a controlled server, to demonstrate code execution. For example, a Python script:
          ```python
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          import sys
          import os

          # Malicious action: create a file
          with open("/tmp/pwned_by_protoscope", "w") as f:
              f.write("PWNED!")

          # Optionally, print input to stdout (to mimic protoscope behavior partially)
          if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == '-s':
              input_data = sys.stdin.read()
              print(input_data) # Just echo input
          else:
              input_data = sys.stdin.read()
              print(input_data) # Just echo input
          ```
          Make this script executable: `chmod +x protoscope.py` and rename it to `protoscope`: `mv protoscope.py protoscope`.
        - **Manipulate PATH:**  Create a directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_bin`) and move the malicious `protoscope` executable into it: `mkdir /tmp/malicious_bin && mv protoscope /tmp/malicious_bin/`.  Modify your PATH environment variable to include `/tmp/malicious_bin` at the *beginning* of the PATH, before the directory where the legitimate `protoscope` is installed. For example: `export PATH="/tmp/malicious_bin:$PATH"`. Verify that `/tmp/malicious_bin` is now listed first in your PATH: `echo $PATH`.
        - **Ensure Legitimate `protoscope` is installed:** Make sure you have the legitimate `protoscope` tool installed and it is in your PATH, but in a directory that comes *after* `/tmp/malicious_bin` in the manipulated PATH.
    2. **Start Burp Suite:** Launch Burp Suite. Ensure the Protobuf extension is loaded.
    3. **Trigger `protoscope` execution:** Send a request to Burp Repeater that will trigger the Protobuf tab to be enabled. For example, send a request with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` or containing `$$markers$$`. Open the "Protobuf" tab. This action should cause the extension to call `decode_protobuf` and thus execute `protoscope`.
    4. **Verify Malicious Execution:** Check if the malicious action defined in your `protoscope` script has been executed. In the example script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_protoscope` has been created and contains "PWNED!".
    5. **Confirm Vulnerability:** If the malicious action has been executed, it confirms that the extension has executed your malicious `protoscope` instead of the legitimate one due to PATH manipulation, demonstrating the path traversal/arbitrary command execution vulnerability.
