### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `proto_lib.py`

    *   Description:
        The `decode_protobuf` and `encode_protobuf` functions in `proto_lib.py` use `subprocess.Popen` to execute the `protoscope` command. The input to these functions, `proto_input`, which is derived from the request body, is passed directly as standard input to the `protoscope` process without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject shell commands into the `protoscope` command execution by crafting a malicious protobuf payload that contains shell metacharacters or commands.

        Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
        1.  An attacker crafts a malicious protobuf payload. This payload will be designed to be interpreted as a command when passed to the shell by `protoscope`. For example, the payload could contain shell command separators like `;`, `&`, or `|` followed by commands such as `whoami`, `ls -al`, or more harmful commands.
        2.  The attacker sends an HTTP request to a web application that is expected to process protobuf messages. The request body contains the crafted malicious protobuf payload. The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/octet-stream` or include `proto` to trigger the extension, or the payload should be enclosed within the defined markers `$$malicious_payload$$`.
        3.  Burp Suite, with the Protobuf Extensibility extension enabled, intercepts this request.
        4.  The extension identifies the request as containing a protobuf message (either via Content-Type or markers) and activates the Protobuf tab.
        5.  When the user interacts with the "Protobuf" tab or when Burp Suite processes the request, the extension calls either `decode_protobuf` or `encode_protobuf` from `proto_lib.py`.
        6.  The malicious protobuf payload (attacker-controlled `proto_input`) is passed to `subprocess.Popen` as standard input for the `protoscope` command without sanitization.
        7.  If `protoscope` or the underlying shell environment is vulnerable to command injection through standard input, the injected commands will be executed on the server where Burp Suite is running.

    *   Impact:
        Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite. This could allow an attacker to:
        *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the Burp Suite user's machine.
        *   Modify files or configurations on the Burp Suite user's machine.
        *   Install malware or backdoors on the Burp Suite user's machine.
        *   Pivot further into the network from the Burp Suite user's machine.
        *   Potentially compromise the security tester's system, which is a critical impact in a security assessment context.

    *   Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    *   Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        There are no mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent command injection. The `proto_lib.py` directly passes the user-controlled input to the shell command without any sanitization or validation.

    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Input Sanitization:** The `proto_input` should be sanitized before being passed to `subprocess.Popen`. This could involve escaping shell metacharacters or validating the input to ensure it only contains expected protobuf data. However, sanitizing protobuf data to prevent command injection when it's processed by `protoscope` might be complex and error-prone.
        *   **Using `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and passing arguments as a list:**  Instead of using `subprocess.Popen` with a string command, `subprocess.run` should be used with `shell=False` and the command and its arguments passed as a list. This avoids shell interpretation of the input. However, `protoscope` is called as a single command "protoscope" without arguments in the code, and the input is passed via stdin. If `protoscope` itself interprets stdin as commands, this might not fully mitigate the issue.  It's crucial to understand how `protoscope` handles standard input.
        *   **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Running `protoscope` in a sandboxed environment or container could limit the impact of command injection, but this is a more complex mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation based on Protobuf Schema:** Ideally, the extension should validate the input against a known protobuf schema. If the schema is known, the extension could parse and serialize the protobuf message in a safe manner, instead of relying on external tools like `protoscope` that might introduce vulnerabilities. However, the extension is designed to handle unknown protobufs, making schema-based validation challenging in all cases.

    *   Preconditions:
        1.  Burp Suite is installed and running with the Protobuf Extensibility extension loaded.
        2.  The `protoscope` tool is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
        3.  The target web application processes protobuf messages and is accessible to the attacker.
        4.  The attacker can craft HTTP requests to the target application and intercept them with Burp Suite.
        5.  The attacker needs to trigger the extension to process the malicious payload, which can be done by setting the `Content-Type` header appropriately or using the defined markers in the request body.
        6.  The user interacts with the "Protobuf" tab in Burp Suite or the extension processes the message in some automated way that triggers the vulnerable code path.

    *   Source Code Analysis:
        1.  **File: `/code/proto_lib.py`**
        2.  **Functions:** `decode_protobuf(proto_input)` and `encode_protobuf(proto_input)`
        3.  **Vulnerable Code Snippet (in both functions):**
            ```python
            p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"],
                                 stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
            stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
            ```
        4.  **Analysis:**
            *   `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"], ...)`: This line executes the `protoscope` command. The command is provided as a list `["protoscope"]`, which is safer than a string when `shell=False` (though `shell=False` is implicit here). However, the vulnerability lies in how `proto_input` is handled.
            *   `stdin=subprocess.PIPE`:  Standard input for the `protoscope` process is set to a pipe.
            *   `p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]`: The `proto_input` is passed as input to the `protoscope` command via the standard input pipe. **Crucially, `proto_input` is not sanitized or validated before being passed to `protoscope`. If `proto_input` contains shell commands or metacharacters that `protoscope` (or the shell it might invoke internally) interprets, command injection can occur.**
        5.  **Visualization:**

            ```
            [Attacker Controlled Proto Input] --> proto_input (Python variable) --> subprocess.Popen stdin --> protoscope command --> [Potential Command Injection if protoscope or shell is vulnerable]
            ```

    *   Security Test Case:
        1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure Burp Suite, Protobuf Extensibility extension, and `protoscope` are installed and configured as described in the extension's README.
        2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a malicious protobuf payload that attempts to execute a simple command like `whoami`. Since we are passing this as standard input to `protoscope`, the exact way to inject commands depends on how `protoscope` processes its input. A simple attempt could be to embed shell commands directly in the protobuf data. Let's try injecting a newline followed by a shell command.  A possible crafted payload could be:
            ```
            1: "test\nwhoami > /tmp/pwned"
            ```
            This attempts to create a protobuf message with field 1 set to "test" followed by a newline and the shell command `whoami > /tmp/pwned`.  The goal is to see if `protoscope`, when processing this input, will execute `whoami > /tmp/pwned`.

        3.  **Set up Burp Suite:**
            *   Start Burp Suite and load the Protobuf Extensibility extension.
            *   Ensure Burp Proxy is running and intercepting traffic.

        4.  **Send Malicious Request:**
            *   Use Burp Repeater or another tool to send an HTTP request.
            *   Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/octet-stream` or include `proto` to activate the extension, or enclose the payload with markers. For simplicity, let's use `application/octet-stream`.
            *   Set the request body to the crafted malicious protobuf payload (encoded as bytes if necessary, depending on how you are sending the request). For example, if sending raw bytes: `echo -e '1: "test\\nwhoami > /tmp/pwned"' | protoscope -s | xxd -p -r` to get the encoded protobuf.  Or try sending the text directly to see if `protoscope` processes it.
            *   Send the request to a target web application (it doesn't need to be a real vulnerable application, just a placeholder to trigger Burp extension).

        5.  **Trigger Extension Processing:**
            *   In Burp Suite, go to the "Protobuf" tab for the intercepted request. This should force the extension to decode the protobuf. Alternatively, just letting the request pass through Burp might be enough if the extension processes requests automatically.

        6.  **Verify Command Execution:**
            *   After sending the request and triggering the extension, check if the command `whoami > /tmp/pwned` was executed. In a Linux environment, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists and contains the output of the `whoami` command.
            *   If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created and contains the username, it confirms that command injection was successful.

        7.  **Refinement (if initial test fails):**
            *   If the initial payload doesn't work, experiment with different shell injection techniques and payloads. Try different command separators, encodings, and commands.
            *   Investigate how `protoscope` processes standard input to identify the exact injection point and syntax.
            *   If direct command injection via protobuf content doesn't work, consider if `protoscope` might be vulnerable to command injection via filenames or other parameters if it processes protobuf definitions or schema files (though this is not apparent from the current code, it's worth considering if further investigation into `protoscope` is needed). In the current code, it seems the vulnerability is directly through the protobuf data itself being passed as stdin.

This test case aims to demonstrate that by crafting a malicious protobuf payload, an attacker can achieve command injection on the system running Burp Suite due to the insecure use of `subprocess.Popen` in `proto_lib.py`.
