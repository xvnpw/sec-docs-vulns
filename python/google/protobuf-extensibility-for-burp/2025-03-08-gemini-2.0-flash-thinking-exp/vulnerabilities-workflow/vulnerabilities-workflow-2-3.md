### Inconsistent Protobuf Modification with Multiple Markers

- Description:
    1. The Burp extension uses markers `$$` to identify Base64-encoded protobuf messages within the request body.
    2. When a request with multiple marked protobuf messages is sent to Burp, the "Protobuf" tab is enabled.
    3. When the user opens the "Protobuf" tab, the extension extracts the content within the *first* pair of markers using the `getMarkers` function, which uses `re.findall(marker_regex, body)` and returns `matches[0]`. This means only the content of the first marker is processed and displayed in the Protobuf tab for editing.
    4. If the user modifies the protobuf in the "Protobuf" tab and resends the request, the `setMarkers` function is used to update the request body. However, `setMarkers` also uses `re.sub(marker_regex, marker_start + proto + marker_end, body)`, which replaces only the *first* occurrence of the marker pattern in the original body with the modified protobuf.
    5. Consequently, if a request contains multiple marked protobuf messages, only the *first* one is consistently processed and modified by the extension. Any subsequent marked protobuf messages in the request body are ignored during editing and modification within the Protobuf tab. This can lead to confusion and unintended modifications if the user expects to edit a different protobuf message than the first one when multiple markers are present.

- Impact:
    - Users may unintentionally modify the wrong protobuf message when multiple marked protobufs are present in a request.
    - This can lead to inconsistencies in testing, where modifications intended for one protobuf message are applied to another, potentially causing unexpected application behavior or masking intended test cases.
    - In a security testing scenario, if an attacker aims to manipulate a specific protobuf message within a request containing multiple protobufs, this vulnerability can lead to incorrect or incomplete manipulation, potentially hindering the discovery of vulnerabilities in the target application.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code currently processes only the first marked protobuf when multiple markers are present.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - The extension should be updated to handle multiple marked protobuf messages correctly.
    - Ideally, the extension should identify and allow users to select and edit each marked protobuf message individually.
    - A simpler mitigation could be to warn the user if multiple markers are detected in a request body and clarify that only the first one will be editable via the Protobuf tab.

- Preconditions:
    - The target application must accept requests with Base64-encoded protobuf messages enclosed in `$$` markers.
    - The request body must contain at least two sets of `$$` markers enclosing different protobuf messages.
    - The user must intend to modify a protobuf message that is not the first one marked in the request body.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_ext.py:ProtoTab.getMarkers(self, body)`**:
       ```python
       def getMarkers(self, body):
           # Perform a regex search
           matches = re.findall(marker_regex, body)
           return matches[0]
       ```
       - This function uses `re.findall` which finds all occurrences of the marker pattern. However, it then returns only `matches[0]`, the first match found. If no matches are found, it will raise an `IndexError`, but in the context of `isEnabled` and `setMessage`, it's assumed that markers are present if the tab is enabled. If there are multiple markers, only the first one's content is returned.

    2. **`proto_ext.py:ProtoTab.setMarkers(self, body, proto)`**:
       ```python
       def setMarkers(self, body, proto):
           return re.sub(marker_regex, marker_start + proto + marker_end, body)
       ```
       - This function uses `re.sub` which, by default, replaces the *first* occurrence of the pattern. If the body contains multiple markers, only the first set of markers and its content will be replaced by the new `proto` content enclosed in markers.

    3. **`proto_ext.py:ProtoTab.setMessage(self, content, is_request)`**:
       ```python
       if self.markers:
           # extract proto from between markers
           proto_content = marker_decode(self.getMarkers(body_content))
       else:
           proto_content = body_content
       ```
       - When markers are detected (`self.markers` is True, set in `isEnabled`), `setMessage` calls `getMarkers` to extract the protobuf content, which as analyzed above, only retrieves the first one.

    4. **`proto_ext.py:ProtoTab.getMessage(self)`**:
       ```python
       if self.markers:
           body_output = self.setMarkers(
               body_content, marker_encode(encode_output)
           )
       else:
           body_output = encode_output
       ```
       - Similarly, `getMessage` calls `setMarkers` to update the body, which, as analyzed above, only replaces the first marker occurrence.

    **Visualization:**

    Assume the original request body is: `prefix$$proto1$$middle$$proto2$$suffix`

    - **`setMessage`**:
        - `getMarkers` extracts `proto1`.
        - `proto1` is decoded and displayed in the Protobuf tab.

    - User modifies `proto1` in the tab to `proto1_modified`.

    - **`getMessage`**:
        - `encode_protobuf(proto1_modified)` encodes `proto1_modified`. Let's say the encoded output is `proto1_modified_encoded`.
        - `setMarkers(body_content, marker_encode_output)` is called with the original body `prefix$$proto1$$middle$$proto2$$suffix` and `marker_encode_output` which is `base64(proto1_modified_encoded)`.
        - `setMarkers` replaces the first occurrence of `$$.*?$$` which is `$$proto1$$` with `$$marker_encode_output$$`.
        - The resulting body becomes: `prefix$$marker_encode_output$$middle$$proto2$$suffix`.
        - Only `proto1` is effectively modified, while `proto2` remains untouched. If the user intended to modify `proto2`, this is inconsistent and incorrect behavior.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure Burp Suite is running with the Protobuf extension loaded.
    2. **Craft a Request:** Create an HTTP request (e.g., using Burp Repeater) with the following body:
       ```
       POST /test HTTP/1.1
       Host: example.com
       Content-Type: application/octet-stream

       prefix$$AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyA=$$middle$$Cg4KCwwNDg8QERITFBUWFxgZGhobHB0eHyA=$$suffix
       ```
       - Here, `AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyA=` and `Cg4KCwwNDg8QERITFBUWFxgZGhobHB0eHyA=` are Base64-encoded representations of two different example protobuf messages. "prefix", "middle", and "suffix" are just arbitrary strings to separate the markers.
    3. **Send to Repeater and Open Protobuf Tab:** Send this request to Burp Repeater. In the Repeater, select the "Protobuf" tab. You should see the decoded content of the *first* protobuf message (`AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyA=`) in the Protobuf tab editor.
    4. **Modify Protobuf Content:** Modify the content in the Protobuf tab editor. For example, change some values or add new fields.
    5. **Resend the Request:** Click "Go" in Burp Repeater to resend the modified request.
    6. **Inspect the Modified Request Body:** In Burp Repeater, go to the "Request" tab and examine the body of the resent request (you might need to switch to "Raw" view to clearly see the body).
    7. **Verify Vulnerability:** Check if only the *first* marked protobuf message in the body has been modified. You should observe that the content corresponding to the first marker `$$AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyA=$$` has been updated with your modifications, while the second marked protobuf message `$$Cg4KCwwNDg8QERITFBUWFxgZGhobHB0eHyA=$$` remains unchanged. This confirms that the extension is only consistently processing and modifying the first marked protobuf, demonstrating the vulnerability.

### Path Traversal/Arbitrary Command Execution via `protoscope` PATH Manipulation

- Description:
    1. The Burp extension relies on an external tool called `protoscope` to decode and encode protobuf messages.
    2. The `proto_lib.py` script uses `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", ...])` and `subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", "-s", ...])` to execute `protoscope` for decoding and encoding, respectively.
    3. The code assumes that `protoscope` is available in the system's PATH environment variable.
    4. If a malicious actor can control or influence the system's PATH environment variable when Burp Suite is launched (e.g., by compromising the user's environment or through social engineering to get the user to run Burp Suite in a modified environment), they could potentially replace the legitimate `protoscope` executable with a malicious one.
    5. When the Burp extension calls `protoscope` via `subprocess.Popen`, it would unknowingly execute the malicious `protoscope` instead of the intended legitimate tool.
    6. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite, with the privileges of the Burp Suite process.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the system running Burp Suite.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control of the security tester's machine by replacing `protoscope` with a malicious executable that performs actions like installing malware, exfiltrating data, or further compromising the system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension relies on the system's PATH and does not validate the `protoscope` executable.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strong Mitigation:** Instead of relying on PATH, the extension should allow users to configure the full path to the `protoscope` executable in the extension settings. This way, the extension would always use the explicitly specified path, regardless of the system's PATH environment variable.
    - **Medium Mitigation:** Validate the `protoscope` executable. Before executing `protoscope`, the extension could perform checks to verify that the executable at the resolved PATH location is indeed the legitimate `protoscope` tool. This could involve checking file signatures, hashes, or locations. However, this is complex and might not be foolproof.
    - **Documentation Mitigation:** Clearly document the security implications of adding `protoscope` to the system's PATH in the extension's README and installation instructions. Warn users about the risks and recommend installing `protoscope` in a secure location and ensuring that no malicious executables are present in directories listed earlier in the PATH.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to influence the PATH environment variable on the system where Burp Suite is run *before* Burp Suite is launched with the Protobuf extension. This could be achieved through various means, including:
        - Compromising the user's system and modifying environment variables.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into running Burp Suite in a modified environment (e.g., running Burp from a shell with a manipulated PATH).
    - The user must have installed the Protobuf extension and be using it.
    - The extension must attempt to execute `protoscope` (e.g., by processing a protobuf request/response in the Protobuf tab).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_lib.py:decode_protobuf(proto_input)`**:
       ```python
       def decode_protobuf(proto_input):
           p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope"],
                                stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
           stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
           return stdout
       ```
    2. **`proto_lib.py:encode_protobuf(proto_input)`**:
       ```python
       def encode_protobuf(proto_input):
           p = subprocess.Popen(["protoscope", "-s"],
                                stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
           stdout = p.communicate(input=proto_input)[0]
           return stdout
       ```
       - Both `decode_protobuf` and `encode_protobuf` functions use `subprocess.Popen` to execute `protoscope`.
       - The first argument to `Popen` is a list containing the command and its arguments. In both cases, the command is simply `"protoscope"` or `["protoscope", "-s"]`.
       - `subprocess.Popen` with a list as the first argument will search for the executable named "protoscope" in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
       - If a malicious executable named `protoscope` is placed in a directory that appears earlier in the PATH than the legitimate `protoscope` installation directory, `subprocess.Popen` will execute the malicious one.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the Protobuf extension in Burp Suite.
        - **Create a malicious `protoscope` executable:** Create a simple script (e.g., Python, Bash, or a compiled executable) named `protoscope`. This script should perform a malicious action, such as creating a file in the `/tmp` directory or making a network request to a controlled server, to demonstrate code execution. For example, a Python script:
          ```python
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          import sys
          import os

          # Malicious action: create a file
          with open("/tmp/pwned_by_protoscope", "w") as f:
              f.write("PWNED!")

          # Optionally, print input to stdout (to mimic protoscope behavior partially)
          if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == '-s':
              input_data = sys.stdin.read()
              print(input_data) # Just echo input
          else:
              input_data = sys.stdin.read()
              print(input_data) # Just echo input
          ```
          Make this script executable: `chmod +x protoscope.py` and rename it to `protoscope`: `mv protoscope.py protoscope`.
        - **Manipulate PATH:**  Create a directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_bin`) and move the malicious `protoscope` executable into it: `mkdir /tmp/malicious_bin && mv protoscope /tmp/malicious_bin/`.  Modify your PATH environment variable to include `/tmp/malicious_bin` at the *beginning* of the PATH, before the directory where the legitimate `protoscope` is installed. For example: `export PATH="/tmp/malicious_bin:$PATH"`. Verify that `/tmp/malicious_bin` is now listed first in your PATH: `echo $PATH`.
        - **Ensure Legitimate `protoscope` is installed:** Make sure you have the legitimate `protoscope` tool installed and it is in your PATH, but in a directory that comes *after* `/tmp/malicious_bin` in the manipulated PATH.
    2. **Start Burp Suite:** Launch Burp Suite. Ensure the Protobuf extension is loaded.
    3. **Trigger `protoscope` execution:** Send a request to Burp Repeater that will trigger the Protobuf tab to be enabled. For example, send a request with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` or containing `$$markers$$`. Open the "Protobuf" tab. This action should cause the extension to call `decode_protobuf` and thus execute `protoscope`.
    4. **Verify Malicious Execution:** Check if the malicious action defined in your `protoscope` script has been executed. In the example script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_protoscope` has been created and contains "PWNED!".
    5. **Confirm Vulnerability:** If the malicious action has been executed, it confirms that the extension has executed your malicious `protoscope` instead of the legitimate one due to PATH manipulation, demonstrating the path traversal/arbitrary command execution vulnerability.
