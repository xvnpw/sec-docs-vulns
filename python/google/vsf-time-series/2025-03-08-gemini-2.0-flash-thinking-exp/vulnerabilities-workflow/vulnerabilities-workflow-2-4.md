- Vulnerability name: Path Traversal in Dataset Filename

- Description:
    1. The `generate_training_data.py` script uses the `--dataset_filename` argument to specify the path to the raw dataset file.
    2. This argument is directly passed to pandas `read_hdf` or `read_csv` functions without any sanitization or validation.
    3. An attacker can provide a malicious path as the `--dataset_filename` argument, such as "../../sensitive_file.txt", to read files outside the intended data directory.
    4. When `generate_training_data.py` is executed with this malicious argument, the pandas library will attempt to read the file from the attacker-specified path.

- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the Python process has permissions to access. This could include sensitive data, configuration files, or even source code, depending on the server setup and file permissions.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses the user-provided filename without any checks.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Sanitize and validate the `dataset_filename` argument to ensure it only points to files within the intended data directory. This can be done by:
        - Using `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.commonprefix` to check if the resolved path is within the allowed data directory.
        - Using a whitelist of allowed data directories and ensuring the provided path starts with one of them.
        - Stripping path traversal characters like ".." from the input filename.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute the `generate_training_data.py` script and control the command-line arguments, specifically `--dataset_filename`. In a real-world scenario, this might be possible if the script is exposed via a web interface or if an attacker has compromised a system where this script is run.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/generate_training_data.py**
    2. **Lines 131-134:** Argument parsing is set up using `argparse`.
    ```python
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(
        "--ds_name", type=str, default="metr-la", help="dataset name."
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--output_dir", type=str, default="data/", help="Output directory."
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--dataset_filename",
        type=str,
        default="data/metr-la.h5",
        help="Raw dataset readings.",
    )
    args = parser.parse_args()
    ```
    3. **Line 141 & 143:** The `dataset_filename` argument, directly from user input, is used in `pd.read_hdf` or `pd.read_csv`.
    ```python
    if args.ds_name == "metr-la":
        df = pd.read_hdf(args.dataset_filename)
    else:
        df = pd.read_csv(args.dataset_filename, delimiter = ",", header=None)
    ```
    4. **Visualization:**
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Input: --dataset_filename] --> B(argparse.parse_args());
        B --> C{args.dataset_filename};
        C --> D[pd.read_hdf/pd.read_csv];
        D --> E[File System Access];
    ```
    The diagram shows that the user-controlled `dataset_filename` goes directly to file system access without any intermediate validation or sanitization.

- Security test case:
    1. **Precondition:** Assume the project code is cloned and the environment is set up as described in `README.md`.
    2. **Step 1:** Navigate to the `/code` directory in a terminal.
    3. **Step 2:** Execute the `generate_training_data.py` script with a malicious `dataset_filename` argument to attempt to read a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux-like systems).
    ```bash
    python generate_training_data.py --ds_name metr-la --output_dir data/METR-LA --dataset_filename ../../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
    4. **Step 3:** Check the output and error messages. If the script attempts to process or read the contents of `/etc/passwd`, it indicates a successful path traversal. Due to potential permission issues, reading `/etc/passwd` might fail, but the attempt itself confirms the vulnerability. A more reliable test would be to target a file that is more likely to be readable by the user running the script, for example, a temporary file created in `/tmp`.
    5. **Step 4 (Improved Test):** Create a temporary file in `/tmp` named `test_file.txt` with some known content:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a test file" > /tmp/test_file.txt
    ```
    6. **Step 5:** Run `generate_training_data.py` to read this temporary file:
    ```bash
    python generate_training_data.py --ds_name metr-la --output_dir data/METR-LA --dataset_filename ../../../../../tmp/test_file.txt
    ```
    7. **Step 6:** Examine the output and error logs. If the script proceeds without errors and potentially attempts to process the content "This is a test file" as dataset, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. The exact behavior will depend on how the script handles the content of `/tmp/test_file.txt`, but the absence of path-related errors and the script attempting to run indicates success.
