- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Configuration File
- Description:
    - An attacker can craft a malicious Python configuration file containing arbitrary code.
    - An unsuspecting user is tricked into loading this malicious configuration file using the `ml_collections.config_flags.DEFINE_config_file` function. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising a location where users might fetch configuration files.
    - When the user runs the application and the configuration file is parsed by `DEFINE_config_file`, the Python code within the malicious configuration file is executed.
    - This leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's application.
- Impact: Critical
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to:
        - Complete system compromise.
        - Data theft and exfiltration.
        - Installation of malware or ransomware.
        - Denial of Service (although DoS is explicitly excluded from this list, it could be a consequence of arbitrary code execution).
        - Any other malicious actions the attacker can program.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
    - The provided code does not include any security measures to prevent code execution from configuration files.
    - Functionality is focused on configuration loading and type checking, not security.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sandboxing or Isolation: Execute configuration files in a restricted environment (sandbox) to limit the damage from malicious code.
    - Static Analysis/Security Scanning: Implement static analysis tools to scan configuration files for suspicious code patterns before loading them.
    - User Warnings: Display clear warnings to users about the security risks of loading configuration files from untrusted or unknown sources.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: While less effective for code execution, validate the configuration structure to detect anomalies (defense in depth).
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Advise users to run applications loading configurations with the minimum necessary privileges.
- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker creates a malicious Python configuration file.
    2. User is convinced to load this malicious configuration file using `ml_collections.config_flags.DEFINE_config_file`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/ml_collections/config_flags/config_flags.py`
        - Function: `DEFINE_config_file`
        - This function defines a flag that takes a path to a configuration file.
        - It uses `ConfigFileFlagParser` to handle parsing of the file.
        - Class: `ConfigFileFlagParser`
            - Method: `parse(self, path)`
            - This method loads the Python module from the provided `path` using `_LoadConfigModule`.
            - It then calls the `get_config()` function within the loaded module.
        - Function: `_LoadConfigModule(name: str, path: str)`
            - This function is responsible for loading the Python module.
            - It uses `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader` to load the module from the given file path.
            - **Vulnerable Code**: `loader.load_module()`: This line executes the Python code present in the configuration file. There are no security checks or sandboxing performed before executing this code.

        graph LR
            A[User executes script with --my_config pointing to attacker's config file] --> B(DEFINE_config_file in script is called);
            B --> C(ConfigFileFlagParser.parse() is invoked);
            C --> D(_LoadConfigModule() loads module from file path);
            D --> E(loader.load_module() executes Python code in config file);
            E --> F{Malicious code in config file executes};
            F --> G[System Compromise];
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious configuration file named `malicious_config.py`:
        ```python
        import os

        def get_config():
            # Malicious payload: creates a file in the /tmp directory
            os.system('touch /tmp/ml_collections_pwned')
            return {'message': 'Configuration loaded, but system is compromised!'}
        ```
    2. Create a test script named `test_config_load.py`:
        ```python
        from absl import app
        from ml_collections import config_flags

        _CONFIG = config_flags.DEFINE_config_file('my_config')

        def main(_):
            config = _CONFIG.value
            print(config)

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(main)
        ```
    3. Run the test script, pointing `--my_config` flag to the malicious configuration file:
        ```bash
        python test_config_load.py -- --my_config=malicious_config.py
        ```
    4. Verify the vulnerability by checking if the malicious code was executed. Check if the file `/tmp/ml_collections_pwned` exists:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/ml_collections_pwned
        ```
        If the file `/tmp/ml_collections_pwned` is listed, the malicious code was successfully executed, demonstrating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
