- Vulnerability Name: Command-Line Flag Injection via Literal Evaluation
- Description:
  - Step 1: An application uses `ml_collections.config_flags` to define configuration settings, allowing users to override these settings via command-line flags.
  - Step 2: The `_LiteralParser` and `_ConfigDictParser` within `ml_collections.config_flags` utilize `ast.literal_eval` to parse string arguments provided through command-line flags. This includes flags intended to override configuration values.
  - Step 3: An attacker crafts a malicious command-line flag, injecting a Python literal as a configuration value. For example, if a configuration parameter controls a file path, the attacker might attempt to inject a path like `"../../../etc/passwd"` or a more complex literal structure.
  - Step 4: When the application parses the command-line arguments, `ast.literal_eval` evaluates the injected literal.
  - Step 5: If the application subsequently uses this configuration value in an insecure manner, such as directly using an overridden file path without validation, it becomes vulnerable to exploitation. For instance, a path traversal vulnerability could arise if an attacker successfully overrides a file path configuration.
- Impact:
  - The impact of this vulnerability depends on how the application utilizes the configuration values. Potential impacts include:
    - Modification of application behavior: Attackers can alter the application's functionality by injecting specific configuration values.
    - Information Disclosure: If configuration values control file paths or data access, attackers might be able to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by injecting paths like "../../../sensitive_file".
    - In specific, less likely scenarios, if the application logic processes evaluated literals in a way that influences control flow, there might be a potential for more severe consequences. However, with `literal_eval`, remote code execution is highly improbable.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Type safety: `ConfigDict` enforces type checking, limiting the type of values that can be assigned to configuration fields, which can restrict the scope of potential injection attacks.
  - Locking mechanism: The locking feature of `ConfigDict` prevents the addition of new configuration fields at runtime, reducing the attack surface to only the pre-defined configurable parameters.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization: There is no explicit sanitization of configuration values provided via command-line flags before they are processed by `ast.literal_eval`.
  - Input validation: The project lacks specific validation to ensure that overridden configuration values are safe and within expected boundaries, especially for sensitive parameters like file paths, URLs, or execution parameters. Application-level validation is crucial for mitigating this vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
  - The target application must utilize `ml_collections.config_flags` to handle configurations.
  - The application must expose configuration settings that can be overridden through command-line flags.
  - At least one configurable parameter must control a sensitive operation, such as file path handling, data access, or execution flow, in a way that can be manipulated by an attacker through injected values.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The vulnerability originates from the use of `ast.literal_eval` within the `_LiteralParser.parse` function in `/code/ml_collections/config_flags/config_flags.py`.
  - ```python
    class _LiteralParser(flags.ArgumentParser):
      def parse(self, argument: str) -> Any:
        ...
        try:
          return ast.literal_eval(argument)
        except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
          # Otherwise, the flag is a string: `--cfg.value="my_string"`
          return argument
    ```
  - This parser is used by `_ConfigFlag` to process command-line overrides for configurations defined using `DEFINE_config_file`, `DEFINE_config_dict`, and `DEFINE_config_dataclass`.
  - The code directly evaluates command-line string arguments using `ast.literal_eval` without any preceding sanitization or validation to restrict the complexity or content of the evaluated literals.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Create a test application (e.g., `test_app.py`) that uses `ml_collections.config_flags` to define a configuration with a `file_path` parameter.
    ```python
    # test_app.py
    from absl import app
    from ml_collections import config_dict
    from ml_collections import config_flags

    config = config_dict.ConfigDict()
    config.file_path = '/tmp/test.txt'  # Default file path

    _CONFIG = config_flags.DEFINE_config_dict('app_config', config)

    def main(_):
      file_path = _CONFIG.value.file_path
      try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
          content = f.read()
          print(f"File content from '{file_path}':\n{content}")
      except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file '{file_path}': {e}")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(main)
    ```
  - Step 2: Run the test application, overriding the `file_path` to attempt path traversal.
    ```bash
    python test_app.py -- --app_config.file_path="'../../../etc/passwd'"
    ```
  - Step 3: Observe the output. If the application attempts to read `/etc/passwd` (or throws an error indicating it tried to access it), it confirms the vulnerability. A secure application should not access `/etc/passwd` based on user-provided configuration without proper validation.
  - Expected vulnerable output (may vary based on OS and permissions):
    ```text
    File content from '../../../../etc/passwd':
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    ... (content of /etc/passwd) ...
    ```
  - A secure application, after mitigation, should either reject the malicious path or handle it safely without unintended file access.
