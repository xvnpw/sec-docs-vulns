- Vulnerability Name: Type URL Manipulation for Task Routing Bypass
- Description:
    An attacker can craft a malicious Pub/Sub message with a manipulated `type_url` in the `Task.args` field. The `worker.py` code uses `task.args.type_url` to determine which task callback to execute. By altering the `type_url` in the message, an attacker can potentially trick the `_process_message` function into looking up and executing a different, unintended task callback.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. Attacker crafts a valid Pub/Sub message for a registered task, say `TaskTypeA`, including correct serialized arguments and `type_url` for `TaskTypeA`.
    2. Attacker modifies this message by changing the `type_url` within the `Task.args` field to that of a different registered task, say `TaskTypeB`. The message payload (serialized arguments) may or may not be modified.
    3. Attacker publishes this modified message to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to.
    4. The worker's `_process_message` function receives the message.
    5. In `_process_message`, the code extracts the `type_url` from the received message: `_, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/')`. Due to the attacker's manipulation, `full_name` now corresponds to `TaskTypeB` instead of the originally intended `TaskTypeA`.
    6. The code uses this manipulated `full_name` to look up the task registration: `registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name]`. This lookup will now retrieve the registration for `TaskTypeB`.
    7. Consequently, the callback associated with `TaskTypeB` (`registration.callback`) will be executed, potentially with arguments originally intended for `TaskTypeA` (if the attacker did not modify the payload).

- Impact:
    The impact depends on the specific task callbacks registered in the application. Successfully manipulating the `type_url` can lead to:
    - **Execution of unintended code paths:** A different task callback than intended is executed. If different tasks have varying levels of security and functionality, this could lead to privilege escalation or unexpected actions.
    - **Data corruption or misuse:** A callback might be executed with arguments that are not intended for it, potentially causing errors or logical flaws in the application's processing.
    - **Information Disclosure:** If different task callbacks handle data with varying security levels, triggering the wrong callback could lead to sensitive information being processed or exposed in an unintended manner.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The library currently does not implement any explicit validation or sanitization of the `type_url` in the incoming messages. It relies on the standard protobuf mechanism for packing and unpacking messages and assumes the `type_url` is trustworthy.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Type URL Validation:** The worker could validate the extracted `type_url` against a list of expected or registered task types before proceeding with task execution. This would involve maintaining a whitelist of allowed `type_url` values and rejecting messages with unexpected or manipulated `type_url`s.
    - **Consider Alternative Task Identification:** While `type_url` is the standard protobuf mechanism, for security-sensitive applications, exploring alternative or supplementary methods for task identification that are less prone to manipulation could be considered. However, this might deviate from standard protobuf practices.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to.
    - The worker application must have registered at least two different task types with distinct callbacks to exploit the routing bypass.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_task_queue/worker.py`:** The vulnerability is located in the `_process_message` function of the `Worker` class.
    2. **Line 95:** `task = task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)` -  Message data is deserialized into a `Task` proto.
    3. **Line 105:** `_, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/')` - The `full_name` of the task type is extracted from `task.args.type_url`. This is the point of vulnerability, as manipulating `task.args.type_url` will directly affect the `full_name`.
    4. **Line 107:** `registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name]` - The `full_name` is used as a key to retrieve the registered task processing logic from `_message_type_registry`. A manipulated `full_name` leads to retrieving a different registration.
    5. **Line 117:** `registration.callback(args)` - The callback associated with the *potentially manipulated* registration is invoked.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Test Tasks:** Define two distinct Protocol Buffer message types, e.g., `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` and `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs`, and corresponding simple callback functions, `callback_task_a` and `callback_task_b`. These callbacks should perform actions that are easily observable in logs or metrics, such as printing a specific message or incrementing a counter.
    2. **Register Tasks:** In a test worker instance, register both `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` with `callback_task_a` and `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs` with `callback_task_b`.
    3. **Prepare Valid Task A Message:** Create a valid `Task` message. Pack a `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` instance into `task.args`. Serialize this message to bytes. This represents a legitimate message for `TaskTypeA`.
    4. **Manipulate Type URL:** Deserialize the valid Task A message back into a `Task` object. Modify the `task.args.type_url` field. Change it to be the `type_url` of `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs`. Re-serialize this modified Task message to bytes. This is the malicious message with a manipulated `type_url`.
    5. **Publish Messages:** Publish both the original valid Task A message (from step 3) and the manipulated message (from step 4) to the Pub/Sub topic the test worker is subscribed to.
    6. **Observe Worker Behavior:** Monitor the logs and execution of the worker.
    7. **Verification:**
        - For the valid Task A message, verify that `callback_task_a` is executed as expected.
        - For the manipulated message, check if `callback_task_b` is executed *instead of* `callback_task_a`. If `callback_task_b` is executed, it confirms the type URL manipulation vulnerability, as the worker incorrectly routed the task based on the attacker-controlled `type_url`. Additionally, observe if any errors or unexpected behavior occurs in `callback_task_b` due to potentially receiving arguments intended for `callback_task_a`.
