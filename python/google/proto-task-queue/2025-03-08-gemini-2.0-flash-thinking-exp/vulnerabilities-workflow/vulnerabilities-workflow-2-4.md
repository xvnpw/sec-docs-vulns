### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Type Confusion in Task Deserialization due to Inconsistent Type URL and Payload**
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Pub/Sub message.
    2. The message contains a `Task` proto.
    3. In the `Task` proto, the `args` field is set up in a way that the `type_url` attribute indicates one proto message type (e.g., `FooTaskArgs`), but the actual serialized data within the `value` attribute of `args` is of a different proto message type (e.g., `BarTaskArgs`).
    4. The worker receives this message and deserializes the `Task` proto.
    5. The worker extracts the `type_url` from `task.args` and uses it to look up the registered task handler for the type indicated by the `type_url` (e.g., the handler for `FooTaskArgs`).
    6. The worker creates an instance of the proto message class corresponding to the `type_url` (e.g., an instance of `FooTaskArgs`).
    7. The worker attempts to unpack the `value` from `task.args` into the created proto message instance using `task.args.Unpack()`.
    8. Due to the type mismatch between the `type_url` and the actual data in `value`, the `Unpack()` operation might still succeed without raising an immediate exception, or might partially deserialize the data into the target proto message type. This depends on Protobuf's deserialization behavior in case of type mismatches.
    9. The worker then calls the registered callback function associated with the type specified in `type_url` (e.g., the callback for `FooTaskArgs`), passing the potentially corrupted or type-confused proto message instance as an argument.
    10. If the callback function for `FooTaskArgs` is not designed to handle or validate the data of `BarTaskArgs` (or partially deserialized data), it can lead to unexpected behavior, application errors, or potentially security vulnerabilities within the worker application logic. This occurs because the worker application is processing data under the assumption that it is of `FooTaskArgs` type, while it is actually (or partially) of `BarTaskArgs` type.
- Impact:
    - **Medium to High**: The impact depends on how the worker application's task callback functions handle unexpected or malformed data. If the callback functions assume the data conforms strictly to the expected proto message type and don't perform input validation, a type confusion vulnerability can lead to:
        - **Application Logic Errors**: The worker might perform actions based on misinterpreted data, leading to incorrect processing of tasks.
        - **Data Corruption**: If the task involves data manipulation or storage, processing with incorrect data types can lead to data corruption.
        - **Security Vulnerabilities in Worker Application**: In more severe cases, if the callback logic is complex and processes the data in a way that is vulnerable to specific data structures (e.g., format string vulnerabilities, injection flaws within the callback if it processes string data without sanitization, etc.), type confusion could be a prerequisite to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    - The severity is ranked as medium to high because while the `proto-task-queue` library itself might not directly execute arbitrary code due to this vulnerability, it creates a condition where the *consuming application* is highly likely to misprocess data, and this misprocessing can have significant security implications depending on the application's specific logic.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Nacking on Deserialization Errors**: The `worker.py` code includes error handling for `proto_message.DecodeError` during the initial deserialization of the `Task` proto itself and also when the `type_url` is not registered. In these cases, the message is nacked (`message.nack()`), which prevents infinite reprocessing of malformed messages and allows for potential recovery if the issue is transient or due to a bug fix deployment. However, this mitigation does not prevent the type confusion issue described above, as the `Task` proto itself *is* successfully deserialized, and the `type_url` *is* registered; the problem is the *mismatch within the `args` field*.
    - **Logging of Unknown Task Types**: The worker logs a warning message "Unknown type of task: %s" if the `type_url` is not found in the `_message_type_registry`. This helps in identifying messages with unregistered task types, but does not mitigate type confusion for registered types.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Type Validation during Unpack**: The `proto-task-queue` library is missing a validation step to ensure that the actual serialized data in `task.args.value` is consistent with the proto message type indicated by `task.args.type_url`. Ideally, after unpacking, the library should perform a check to confirm that the deserialized message is indeed of the expected type or at least compatible with it. However, enforcing strict type checking at this level might be complex and could have performance implications.
    - **Documentation on Input Validation**: The project documentation should explicitly emphasize the critical importance of input validation within the task callback functions in the worker application. Developers using this library should be warned about the potential risks of type confusion and the necessity to validate the structure and content of the `args` proto message received in their callbacks before processing them.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to. In a typical cloud environment, this might be possible if the attacker has compromised a service account with publishing permissions or if the Pub/Sub topic is misconfigured to allow unauthorized publishing.
    - The worker application must be configured to register and process at least two different task types (e.g., `FooTaskArgs` and `BarTaskArgs`).
    - The task callback functions in the worker application must not perform sufficient input validation on the received `args` proto message to detect or handle type mismatches.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_task_queue/worker.py` - `_process_message` function**:
        ```python
        def _process_message(self, message: pubsub_message.Message) -> None:
            # ...
            # Extract the task proto from the message.
            try:
              task = task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)
            except proto_message.DecodeError as e:
              # ... error handling ...
              return

            # Find the registration, based on the type of proto stored in task.args.
            _, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/') # [highlight-line]
            try:
              registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name] # [highlight-line]
            except KeyError:
              # ... unknown type handling ...
              return

            # Get the args proto.
            args = registration.task_args_class() # [highlight-line]
            task.args.Unpack(args) # [highlight-line]

            # ... callback execution ...
            try:
              registration.callback(args) # [highlight-line]
            except Exception:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
              # ... callback error handling ...
              message.nack()
            else:
              message.ack()
        ```
        - **Line Highlighted 1 & 2**: The `full_name` is extracted from `task.args.type_url` and used to retrieve the `registration`. There is no validation here to check if the `type_url` is a legitimate or expected value beyond being a registered key.
        - **Line Highlighted 3**: `args = registration.task_args_class()` creates an instance of the proto class based on the `type_url`.
        - **Line Highlighted 4**: `task.args.Unpack(args)` attempts to deserialize `task.args.value` into the `args` object. If the actual data in `task.args.value` is not compatible with `args`'s type (due to attacker manipulation of `type_url` and `value`), the behavior is not strictly controlled or validated by the library. It relies on Protobuf's `Unpack` behavior which might not always raise an exception on type mismatch, potentially leading to partial deserialization or unexpected success.
        - **Line Highlighted 5**: `registration.callback(args)` calls the registered callback with the potentially type-confused `args` object.

    2. **No explicit type validation**:  The code does not include any explicit checks to validate if the unpacked `args` object truly conforms to the type indicated by the `type_url`. It trusts that the `type_url` and `value` are consistent and valid.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create two simple task proto definitions: `FooTaskArgs` with a `widget` string field and `BarTaskArgs` with a `best_number` int32 field (these are already defined in `test_task.proto`).
        - Implement two callback functions: `foo_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs)` and `bar_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs)`.
            ```python
            def foo_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs):
                if isinstance(args, test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs) and hasattr(args, 'widget'):
                    if args.widget == "test_widget":
                        print("Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs correctly.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs but with unexpected widget value: {args.widget}")
                else:
                    print("Foo Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not FooTaskArgs or missing 'widget'.")

            def bar_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs):
                if isinstance(args, test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs) and hasattr(args, 'best_number'):
                    if args.best_number == 42:
                        print("Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs correctly.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs but with unexpected best_number: {args.best_number}")
                else:
                    print("Bar Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not BarTaskArgs or missing 'best_number'.")
            ```
        - Initialize a `Worker` instance and register both callbacks:
            ```python
            test_worker = worker.Worker()
            test_worker.register(test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs, foo_task_callback)
            test_worker.register(test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs, bar_task_callback)
            ```
        - Get a Pub/Sub topic name (you may need to create one if you don't have a test topic). Let's assume `test_topic_name` is the topic name.

    2. **Craft Malicious Message**:
        ```python
        import google.protobuf.any_pb2
        from proto_task_queue import task_pb2
        from proto_task_queue import test_task_pb2

        # 1. Create BarTaskArgs payload
        bar_args_payload = test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs()
        bar_args_payload.best_number = 42
        serialized_bar_args = bar_args_payload.SerializeToString()

        # 2. Create Any proto for args, but set type_url to FooTaskArgs's type_url
        any_args = google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any()
        any_args.type_url = 'type.googleapis.com/proto_task_queue.test_task.FooTaskArgs' # Intentionally set to FooTaskArgs
        any_args.value = serialized_bar_args # But value is serialized BarTaskArgs

        # 3. Create Task proto
        malicious_task = task_pb2.Task()
        malicious_task.args.CopyFrom(any_args)
        malicious_task_bytes = malicious_task.SerializeToString()
        ```

    3. **Publish Malicious Message**:
        - Use a Pub/Sub publisher client to publish a message to `test_topic_name`. Set the `data` of the Pub/Sub message to `malicious_task_bytes`.

    4. **Run Worker and Observe Output**:
        - Start the worker subscribing to the subscription associated with `test_topic_name`.
        - Observe the console output from the worker application.

    5. **Expected Result**:
        - You should observe the output from the `foo_task_callback`.
        - If type confusion occurs, the output from `foo_task_callback` will likely indicate that it processed `FooTaskArgs` *incorrectly* or that it detected type confusion (depending on the callback implementation). For example, if `Unpack` partially deserializes or doesn't fully fail, and the `foo_task_callback` tries to access `args.widget`, it might find unexpected data or no data at all for the `widget` field, while the `BarTaskArgs` data might have been (partially) placed in other fields of the `FooTaskArgs` object if there are any compatible fields by chance.  If the callback prints "Foo Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not FooTaskArgs or missing 'widget'." or "Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs but with unexpected widget value: ..." , it confirms the vulnerability. If it prints "Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs correctly." then it's even worse as it executed the wrong callback entirely (which is less likely given the code structure, but worth considering).

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can send a message that, due to inconsistent `type_url` and payload, can lead to type confusion within the worker application when processing tasks. The lack of validation in `proto-task-queue` library for type consistency exacerbates this issue, placing the burden entirely on the developers of the worker application to implement robust input validation in their task callback functions.
