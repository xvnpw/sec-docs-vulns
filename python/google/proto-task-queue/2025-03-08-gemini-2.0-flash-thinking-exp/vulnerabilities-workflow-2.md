### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Type URL Manipulation for Task Routing Bypass
- Description:
    An attacker can craft a malicious Pub/Sub message with a manipulated `type_url` in the `Task.args` field. The `worker.py` code uses `task.args.type_url` to determine which task callback to execute. By altering the `type_url` in the message, an attacker can potentially trick the `_process_message` function into looking up and executing a different, unintended task callback.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. Attacker crafts a valid Pub/Sub message for a registered task, say `TaskTypeA`, including correct serialized arguments and `type_url` for `TaskTypeA`.
    2. Attacker modifies this message by changing the `type_url` within the `Task.args` field to that of a different registered task, say `TaskTypeB`. The message payload (serialized arguments) may or may not be modified.
    3. Attacker publishes this modified message to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to.
    4. The worker's `_process_message` function receives the message.
    5. In `_process_message`, the code extracts the `type_url` from the received message: `_, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/')`. Due to the attacker's manipulation, `full_name` now corresponds to `TaskTypeB` instead of the originally intended `TaskTypeA`.
    6. The code uses this manipulated `full_name` to look up the task registration: `registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name]`. This lookup will now retrieve the registration for `TaskTypeB`.
    7. Consequently, the callback associated with `TaskTypeB` (`registration.callback`) will be executed, potentially with arguments originally intended for `TaskTypeA` (if the attacker did not modify the payload).
- Impact:
    The impact depends on the specific task callbacks registered in the application. Successfully manipulating the `type_url` can lead to:
    - **Execution of unintended code paths:** A different task callback than intended is executed. If different tasks have varying levels of security and functionality, this could lead to privilege escalation or unexpected actions.
    - **Data corruption or misuse:** A callback might be executed with arguments that are not intended for it, potentially causing errors or logical flaws in the application's processing.
    - **Information Disclosure:** If different task callbacks handle data with varying security levels, triggering the wrong callback could lead to sensitive information being processed or exposed in an unintended manner.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The library currently does not implement any explicit validation or sanitization of the `type_url` in the incoming messages. It relies on the standard protobuf mechanism for packing and unpacking messages and assumes the `type_url` is trustworthy.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Type URL Validation:** The worker could validate the extracted `type_url` against a list of expected or registered task types before proceeding with task execution. This would involve maintaining a whitelist of allowed `type_url` values and rejecting messages with unexpected or manipulated `type_url`s.
    - **Consider Alternative Task Identification:** While `type_url` is the standard protobuf mechanism, for security-sensitive applications, exploring alternative or supplementary methods for task identification that are less prone to manipulation could be considered. However, this might deviate from standard protobuf practices.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to.
    - The worker application must have registered at least two different task types with distinct callbacks to exploit the routing bypass.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_task_queue/worker.py`:** The vulnerability is located in the `_process_message` function of the `Worker` class.
    2. **Line 95:** `task = task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)` -  Message data is deserialized into a `Task` proto.
    3. **Line 105:** `_, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/')` - The `full_name` of the task type is extracted from `task.args.type_url`. This is the point of vulnerability, as manipulating `task.args.type_url` will directly affect the `full_name`.
    4. **Line 107:** `registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name]` - The `full_name` is used as a key to retrieve the registered task processing logic from `_message_type_registry`. A manipulated `full_name` leads to retrieving a different registration.
    5. **Line 117:** `registration.callback(args)` - The callback associated with the *potentially manipulated* registration is invoked.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Test Tasks:** Define two distinct Protocol Buffer message types, e.g., `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` and `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs`, and corresponding simple callback functions, `callback_task_a` and `callback_task_b`. These callbacks should perform actions that are easily observable in logs or metrics, such as printing a specific message or incrementing a counter.
    2. **Register Tasks:** In a test worker instance, register both `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` with `callback_task_a` and `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs` with `callback_task_b`.
    3. **Prepare Valid Task A Message:** Create a valid `Task` message. Pack a `VulnerabilityTestTaskAArgs` instance into `task.args`. Serialize this message to bytes. This represents a legitimate message for `TaskTypeA`.
    4. **Manipulate Type URL:** Deserialize the valid Task A message back into a `Task` object. Modify the `task.args.type_url` field. Change it to be the `type_url` of `VulnerabilityTestTaskBArgs`. Re-serialize this modified Task message to bytes. This is the malicious message with a manipulated `type_url`.
    5. **Publish Messages:** Publish both the original valid Task A message (from step 3) and the manipulated message (from step 4) to the Pub/Sub topic the test worker is subscribed to.
    6. **Observe Worker Behavior:** Monitor the logs and execution of the worker.
    7. **Verification:**
        - For the valid Task A message, verify that `callback_task_a` is executed as expected.
        - For the manipulated message, check if `callback_task_b` is executed *instead of* `callback_task_a`. If `callback_task_b` is executed, it confirms the type URL manipulation vulnerability, as the worker incorrectly routed the task based on the attacker-controlled `type_url`. Additionally, observe if any errors or unexpected behavior occurs in `callback_task_b` due to potentially receiving arguments intended for `callback_task_a`.

#### Vulnerability Name: Potential Deserialization Vulnerability in Task Proto Deserialization
- Description: The `Worker._process_message` function in `proto_task_queue/worker.py` deserializes the incoming Pub/Sub message data into a `Task` protobuf message using `task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)`. If the `FromString` method of the protobuf library is vulnerable to maliciously crafted protobuf messages, an attacker could exploit this by publishing a specially crafted message to the Pub/Sub topic. This crafted message aims to trigger a vulnerability during the deserialization process.
- Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the deserialization vulnerability in the protobuf library. This could range from information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Error handling with `try...except proto_message.DecodeError` in `Worker._process_message`. If deserialization fails (specifically a `DecodeError`), the message is nacked using `message.nack()`. This prevents infinite retries for invalid messages but does not prevent the underlying deserialization vulnerability if one exists within the protobuf library itself.
- Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization on the incoming message data before deserialization is not implemented, which is generally challenging for binary protobuf data. Regular updates of the protobuf library to the latest version are crucial to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities. Employing secure deserialization practices recommended by the protobuf library maintainers, if any are available.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to. This could be achieved through compromising a service with publishing permissions, exploiting misconfigured access controls in Pub/Sub, or through other means of unauthorized message injection into the queue.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/proto_task_queue/worker.py`
    - Function: `_process_message`
    ```python
    def _process_message(self, message: pubsub_message.Message) -> None:
        """Processes a single message from Pub/Sub.
        ...
        """
        # Extract the task proto from the message.
        try:
            task = task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)
        except proto_message.DecodeError as e:
            logging.error('Unable to deserialize Task proto: %s', e)
            message.nack()
            return
        ...
    ```
    - The code directly uses `task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)` to deserialize the message data. If `protobuf.message.DecodeError` or `FromString` is vulnerable when parsing malicious binary data, this code is susceptible. The `try-except` block only catches `DecodeError`, and might not catch all potential deserialization issues, and even when caught, it only nacks the message, not preventing the vulnerability from being triggered.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft a Malicious Protobuf Message**: Construct a protobuf message payload specifically designed to exploit potential deserialization vulnerabilities in the `protobuf` library's `FromString` method. This might involve techniques such as creating messages with deeply nested structures, cyclic references (if applicable and exploitable), very large field values, or deliberately malformed data that could trigger parser weaknesses. For example, if a vulnerability related to excessive recursion depth in protobuf deserialization exists, craft a message with extremely deep nesting.
    2. **Publish the Malicious Message**: Using a Pub/Sub publisher client, publish the crafted malicious protobuf message to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to.
    3. **Observe Worker Behavior**: Monitor the worker's logs and runtime behavior.
        - **Expected Harmless Outcome**: The worker logs a `DecodeError` and nacks the message. The worker continues to operate normally. This indicates the basic error handling is working, but doesn't rule out other types of deserialization issues.
        - **Potential Vulnerability Indication**: If the worker crashes, hangs, consumes excessive resources (CPU or memory), or exhibits other abnormal behavior beyond simply logging a `DecodeError` and nacking the message, it strongly suggests a potential deserialization vulnerability is being triggered. In a more severe scenario, observe if the worker's process can be controlled remotely after sending the malicious message, which could indicate remote code execution.
    4. **Refine the Test Case**: If initial tests show potential vulnerability indications, research known protobuf deserialization vulnerabilities and refine the malicious message to specifically target those known weaknesses for a more precise exploit demonstration.

#### Vulnerability Name: Potential Deserialization Vulnerability in Task Args Unpacking
- Description: After successfully deserializing the `Task` proto, the `Worker._process_message` function unpacks the `args` field using `task.args.Unpack(args)`. If the `Unpack` method of the protobuf library is vulnerable to maliciously crafted protobuf messages embedded within the `Task.args` field, an attacker could exploit this. This crafted `args` payload aims to trigger a vulnerability during the unpacking process into the specific task argument message type.
- Impact: Similar to the previous vulnerability, successful exploitation of a deserialization vulnerability in `Unpack` could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution. The impact depends on the specifics of the vulnerability within the protobuf library's `Unpack` implementation.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:  Error handling for `DecodeError` during the initial `Task` deserialization in `Worker._process_message`. However, there is no specific error handling directly around the `task.args.Unpack(args)` call itself within the provided code snippet. If `Unpack` fails, exceptions might be caught by broader exception handling around the task callback execution, leading to a message nack, but not directly mitigating the deserialization vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations: Input validation on the packed `args` data before the `Unpack` operation is performed.  Regularly update the protobuf library to incorporate security patches. Consider using secure deserialization options or best practices recommended by the protobuf library if available.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic, embedding a malicious payload within the `Task.args` field of the protobuf message.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/proto_task_queue/worker.py`
    - Function: `_process_message`
    ```python
    def _process_message(self, message: pubsub_message.Message) -> None:
        """Processes a single message from Pub/Sub.
        ...
        """
        ...
        # Get the args proto.
        args = registration.task_args_class()
        task.args.Unpack(args)
        ...
        # Call the registered callback.
        logging.info('Processing task (message_id=%s):\n%s', message.message_id,
                     task_string)
        try:
            registration.callback(args)
        except Exception:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
            logging.exception('Task failed (message_id=%s).', message.message_id)
            # See the comment above about nacking on self._task_to_string() failures
            # for the considerations here.
            message.nack()
        ...
    ```
    - The code calls `task.args.Unpack(args)` directly. If `protobuf.message.Message.Unpack` is vulnerable to malicious input within the packed `args` data, this code becomes vulnerable. While a general `try-except` block surrounds the `registration.callback(args)` which might catch some exceptions from `Unpack`, it's not a specific mitigation for deserialization vulnerabilities in `Unpack` itself. It primarily handles exceptions during callback execution, and the nack is a general error handling mechanism, not a security mitigation for deserialization flaws.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft a Malicious Args Payload**: Construct a protobuf message payload that will be packed into the `Task.args` field. This payload should be designed to exploit potential deserialization vulnerabilities specifically in the `protobuf` library's `Unpack` method. Explore techniques similar to those for `FromString`, but focusing on vulnerabilities that might arise during the unpacking of a message into a specific type, such as type confusion, buffer overflows, or issues related to handling unexpected or malformed data within the packed message. For example, if `Unpack` has issues with certain field types or repeated fields, craft a payload that heavily utilizes these.
    2. **Create a Task Message with Malicious Args**: Embed the crafted malicious args payload into a valid `Task` protobuf message. Ensure the `type_url` in `Task.args` is set correctly to correspond to a registered task type so that the `Unpack` operation is actually attempted by the worker.
    3. **Publish the Malicious Task Message**: Publish the complete `Task` message, containing the malicious `args` payload, to the Pub/Sub topic.
    4. **Observe Worker Behavior**: Monitor the worker's logs and runtime behavior.
        - **Expected Harmless Outcome**: The worker processes the message, potentially logs warnings about the message content if validation exists within the callback (though not in the provided library code itself), and completes without crashing or exhibiting abnormal behavior related to deserialization.
        - **Potential Vulnerability Indication**: If the worker crashes, hangs, consumes excessive resources, or exhibits other unexpected behavior during or after the `task.args.Unpack(args)` call, it suggests a potential deserialization vulnerability in `Unpack`. Investigate further if you can achieve code execution or other security-relevant impacts.
    5. **Refine the Test Case**: As with the `FromString` test, research known vulnerabilities related to `protobuf` `Unpack` and refine the malicious payload to target those specific weaknesses for a more targeted and effective exploit demonstration.

#### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization in Task Processing
- Description: An attacker can craft a malicious Protocol Buffer message and publish it to the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic used by the task queue system. When a worker processes this message, the insecure deserialization of the crafted Protocol Buffer message could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Protocol Buffer deserialization process or in the task processing logic that handles the deserialized data without proper validation or sanitization.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the insecure deserialization and the subsequent processing logic. This could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker instance. In case of RCE, attacker could gain full control over the worker, potentially leading to data exfiltration, service disruption, and further propagation of attacks within the cloud environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the description. It's unclear if there are any specific mitigations against insecure deserialization or malicious protobuf messages in the project.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of deserialized data before processing. The system should validate the structure and content of the deserialized Protocol Buffer messages to ensure they conform to expected schemas and do not contain malicious payloads.
    - Secure deserialization practices for Protocol Buffers. The project should employ secure deserialization libraries and methods to prevent exploitation of known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of task processing environments. Implementing sandboxing or containerization for task processing can limit the impact of successful exploits by restricting the attacker's access to the underlying system.
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing. Performing security audits and penetration testing can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the task processing logic and deserialization mechanisms.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to publish messages to the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic used by the task queue system. This might be possible if the Pub/Sub topic permissions are misconfigured, or if the attacker has compromised credentials allowing them to publish messages.
    - The worker application must be vulnerable to insecure deserialization when processing Protocol Buffer messages. This vulnerability depends on how the Protocol Buffer messages are deserialized and how the deserialized data is subsequently processed by the worker application.
- Source Code Analysis: To confirm this vulnerability, source code analysis is needed to examine how Protocol Buffer messages are deserialized and processed within the worker application.
    1. **Identify Deserialization Points:** Locate the code sections where Protocol Buffer messages received from Google Cloud Pub/Sub are deserialized. Look for functions or libraries used for Protocol Buffer deserialization in Python (e.g., `protobuf` library).
    2. **Analyze Data Processing Logic:** Trace the flow of deserialized data through the worker application's code. Examine how the application processes the data extracted from the Protocol Buffer messages. Pay close attention to any code that directly uses data from the deserialized message to perform actions, especially actions that involve system calls, external commands, or data manipulation without proper validation.
    3. **Look for Vulnerable Patterns:** Identify potential insecure deserialization patterns. This could include:
        - Lack of input validation on the deserialized data.
        - Usage of deserialized data in operations that are susceptible to injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, path traversal).
        - Deserialization methods that are known to be vulnerable to object injection or other deserialization exploits in the context of Python and the `protobuf` library.
    4. **Example Scenario (Hypothetical):**
       Assume the worker code includes a function that processes a task message and uses a field from the deserialized message to construct a command:
       ```python
       import subprocess
       import proto  # Hypothetical protobuf library

       def process_task(message_data):
           task_message = proto.deserialize(message_data)
           command_to_execute = task_message.command # Attacker-controlled data

           # Insecure command execution
           subprocess.run(command_to_execute, shell=True)
       ```
       In this hypothetical example, if the `task_message.command` field is directly taken from the deserialized Protocol Buffer message without any sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands by crafting a protobuf message with a payload like `"command": "ls -al ; rm -rf /"`. When the worker processes this message, it would execute the attacker-controlled command.
- Security Test Case: To verify this vulnerability, a security test case can be designed to simulate an attacker sending a malicious Protocol Buffer message and observing the worker's behavior.
    1. **Setup Test Environment:** Set up a test environment that mirrors the production environment, including a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic and a running instance of the worker application.
    2. **Craft Malicious Protobuf Message:** Create a malicious Protocol Buffer message. The content of this message should be designed to exploit the potential insecure deserialization vulnerability. This will depend on the specifics of the application and the potential vulnerability identified in the source code analysis. For example, if a command injection vulnerability is suspected as in the hypothetical example above, craft a message that includes a malicious command in the relevant field.
    3. **Publish Malicious Message:** Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub client libraries or tools to publish the crafted malicious Protocol Buffer message to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker application is subscribed to. Ensure that the message is correctly formatted and targeted at the appropriate topic.
    4. **Monitor Worker Application:** Observe the worker application's logs, behavior, and system state after publishing the malicious message. Look for signs of successful exploitation, such as:
        - Error messages indicating issues with deserialization or processing.
        - Unexpected behavior in the worker application.
        - Evidence of command execution or other actions triggered by the malicious payload (e.g., creation of files, network connections, system resource usage).
    5. **Example Test Case (Based on Hypothetical Command Injection):**
       - **Malicious Protobuf Message Payload:** Create a protobuf message where the `command` field is set to `"; touch /tmp/pwned_protobuf_exploit"`.
       - **Publish Message:** Publish this message to the Pub/Sub topic.
       - **Verification:** Check if a file named `pwned_protobuf_exploit` is created in the `/tmp/` directory on the worker instance after the worker processes the message. If the file is created, it indicates successful command injection through the crafted protobuf message and confirms the insecure deserialization vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Type Confusion in Task Deserialization due to Inconsistent Type URL and Payload
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Pub/Sub message.
    2. The message contains a `Task` proto.
    3. In the `Task` proto, the `args` field is set up in a way that the `type_url` attribute indicates one proto message type (e.g., `FooTaskArgs`), but the actual serialized data within the `value` attribute of `args` is of a different proto message type (e.g., `BarTaskArgs`).
    4. The worker receives this message and deserializes the `Task` proto.
    5. The worker extracts the `type_url` from `task.args` and uses it to look up the registered task handler for the type indicated by the `type_url` (e.g., the handler for `FooTaskArgs`).
    6. The worker creates an instance of the proto message class corresponding to the `type_url` (e.g., an instance of `FooTaskArgs`).
    7. The worker attempts to unpack the `value` from `task.args` into the created proto message instance using `task.args.Unpack()`.
    8. Due to the type mismatch between the `type_url` and the actual data in `value`, the `Unpack()` operation might still succeed without raising an immediate exception, or might partially deserialize the data into the target proto message type. This depends on Protobuf's deserialization behavior in case of type mismatches.
    9. The worker then calls the registered callback function associated with the type specified in `type_url` (e.g., the callback for `FooTaskArgs`), passing the potentially corrupted or type-confused proto message instance as an argument.
    10. If the callback function for `FooTaskArgs` is not designed to handle or validate the data of `BarTaskArgs` (or partially deserialized data), it can lead to unexpected behavior, application errors, or potentially security vulnerabilities within the worker application logic. This occurs because the worker application is processing data under the assumption that it is of `FooTaskArgs` type, while it is actually (or partially) of `BarTaskArgs` type.
- Impact:
    - **Medium to High**: The impact depends on how the worker application's task callback functions handle unexpected or malformed data. If the callback functions assume the data conforms strictly to the expected proto message type and don't perform input validation, a type confusion vulnerability can lead to:
        - **Application Logic Errors**: The worker might perform actions based on misinterpreted data, leading to incorrect processing of tasks.
        - **Data Corruption**: If the task involves data manipulation or storage, processing with incorrect data types can lead to data corruption.
        - **Security Vulnerabilities in Worker Application**: In more severe cases, if the callback logic is complex and processes the data in a way that is vulnerable to specific data structures (e.g., format string vulnerabilities, injection flaws within the callback if it processes string data without sanitization, etc.), type confusion could be a prerequisite to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    - The severity is ranked as medium to high because while the `proto-task-queue` library itself might not directly execute arbitrary code due to this vulnerability, it creates a condition where the *consuming application* is highly likely to misprocess data, and this misprocessing can have significant security implications depending on the application's specific logic.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Nacking on Deserialization Errors**: The `worker.py` code includes error handling for `proto_message.DecodeError` during the initial deserialization of the `Task` proto itself and also when the `type_url` is not registered. In these cases, the message is nacked (`message.nack()`), which prevents infinite reprocessing of malformed messages and allows for potential recovery if the issue is transient or due to a bug fix deployment. However, this mitigation does not prevent the type confusion issue described above, as the `Task` proto itself *is* successfully deserialized, and the `type_url` *is* registered; the problem is the *mismatch within the `args` field*.
    - **Logging of Unknown Task Types**: The worker logs a warning message "Unknown type of task: %s" if the `type_url` is not found in the `_message_type_registry`. This helps in identifying messages with unregistered task types, but does not mitigate type confusion for registered types.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Type Validation during Unpack**: The `proto-task-queue` library is missing a validation step to ensure that the actual serialized data in `task.args.value` is consistent with the proto message type indicated by `task.args.type_url`. Ideally, after unpacking, the library should perform a check to confirm that the deserialized message is indeed of the expected type or at least compatible with it. However, enforcing strict type checking at this level might be complex and could have performance implications.
    - **Documentation on Input Validation**: The project documentation should explicitly emphasize the critical importance of input validation within the task callback functions in the worker application. Developers using this library should be warned about the potential risks of type confusion and the necessity to validate the structure and content of the `args` proto message received in their callbacks before processing them.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic that the worker is subscribed to. In a typical cloud environment, this might be possible if the attacker has compromised a service account with publishing permissions or if the Pub/Sub topic is misconfigured to allow unauthorized publishing.
    - The worker application must be configured to register and process at least two different task types (e.g., `FooTaskArgs` and `BarTaskArgs`).
    - The task callback functions in the worker application must not perform sufficient input validation on the received `args` proto message to detect or handle type mismatches.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`proto_task_queue/worker.py` - `_process_message` function**:
        ```python
        def _process_message(self, message: pubsub_message.Message) -> None:
            # ...
            # Extract the task proto from the message.
            try:
              task = task_pb2.Task.FromString(message.data)
            except proto_message.DecodeError as e:
              # ... error handling ...
              return

            # Find the registration, based on the type of proto stored in task.args.
            _, _, full_name = task.args.type_url.partition('/') # [highlight-line]
            try:
              registration = self._message_type_registry[full_name] # [highlight-line]
            except KeyError:
              # ... unknown type handling ...
              return

            # Get the args proto.
            args = registration.task_args_class() # [highlight-line]
            task.args.Unpack(args) # [highlight-line]

            # ... callback execution ...
            try:
              registration.callback(args) # [highlight-line]
            except Exception:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
              # ... callback error handling ...
              message.nack()
            else:
              message.ack()
        ```
        - **Line Highlighted 1 & 2**: The `full_name` is extracted from `task.args.type_url` and used to retrieve the `registration`. There is no validation here to check if the `type_url` is a legitimate or expected value beyond being a registered key.
        - **Line Highlighted 3**: `args = registration.task_args_class()` creates an instance of the proto class based on the `type_url`.
        - **Line Highlighted 4**: `task.args.Unpack(args)` attempts to deserialize `task.args.value` into the `args` object. If the actual data in `task.args.value` is not compatible with `args`'s type (due to attacker manipulation of `type_url` and `value`), the behavior is not strictly controlled or validated by the library. It relies on Protobuf's `Unpack` behavior which might not always raise an exception on type mismatch, potentially leading to partial deserialization or unexpected success.
        - **Line Highlighted 5**: `registration.callback(args)` calls the registered callback with the potentially type-confused `args` object.

    2. **No explicit type validation**:  The code does not include any explicit checks to validate if the unpacked `args` object truly conforms to the type indicated by the `type_url`. It trusts that the `type_url` and `value` are consistent and valid.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create two simple task proto definitions: `FooTaskArgs` with a `widget` string field and `BarTaskArgs` with a `best_number` int32 field (these are already defined in `test_task.proto`).
        - Implement two callback functions: `foo_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs)` and `bar_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs)`.
            ```python
            def foo_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs):
                if isinstance(args, test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs) and hasattr(args, 'widget'):
                    if args.widget == "test_widget":
                        print("Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs correctly.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs but with unexpected widget value: {args.widget}")
                else:
                    print("Foo Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not FooTaskArgs or missing 'widget'.")

            def bar_task_callback(args: test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs):
                if isinstance(args, test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs) and hasattr(args, 'best_number'):
                    if args.best_number == 42:
                        print("Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs correctly.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs but with unexpected best_number: {args.best_number}")
                else:
                    print("Bar Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not BarTaskArgs or missing 'best_number'.")
            ```
        - Initialize a `Worker` instance and register both callbacks:
            ```python
            test_worker = worker.Worker()
            test_worker.register(test_task_pb2.FooTaskArgs, foo_task_callback)
            test_worker.register(test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs, bar_task_callback)
            ```
        - Get a Pub/Sub topic name (you may need to create one if you don't have a test topic). Let's assume `test_topic_name` is the topic name.

    2. **Craft Malicious Message**:
        ```python
        import google.protobuf.any_pb2
        from proto_task_queue import task_pb2
        from proto_task_queue import test_task_pb2

        # 1. Create BarTaskArgs payload
        bar_args_payload = test_task_pb2.BarTaskArgs()
        bar_args_payload.best_number = 42
        serialized_bar_args = bar_args_payload.SerializeToString()

        # 2. Create Any proto for args, but set type_url to FooTaskArgs's type_url
        any_args = google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any()
        any_args.type_url = 'type.googleapis.com/proto_task_queue.test_task.FooTaskArgs' # Intentionally set to FooTaskArgs
        any_args.value = serialized_bar_args # But value is serialized BarTaskArgs

        # 3. Create Task proto
        malicious_task = task_pb2.Task()
        malicious_task.args.CopyFrom(any_args)
        malicious_task_bytes = malicious_task.SerializeToString()
        ```

    3. **Publish Malicious Message**:
        - Use a Pub/Sub publisher client to publish a message to `test_topic_name`. Set the `data` of the Pub/Sub message to `malicious_task_bytes`.

    4. **Run Worker and Observe Output**:
        - Start the worker subscribing to the subscription associated with `test_topic_name`.
        - Observe the console output from the worker application.

    5. **Expected Result**:
        - You should observe the output from the `foo_task_callback`.
        - If type confusion occurs, the output from `foo_task_callback` will likely indicate that it processed `FooTaskArgs` *incorrectly* or that it detected type confusion (depending on the callback implementation). For example, if `Unpack` partially deserializes or doesn't fully fail, and the `foo_task_callback` tries to access `args.widget`, it might find unexpected data or no data at all for the `widget` field, while the `BarTaskArgs` data might have been (partially) placed in other fields of the `FooTaskArgs` object if there are any compatible fields by chance.  If the callback prints "Foo Task Callback: Type Confusion Detected - Args is not FooTaskArgs or missing 'widget'." or "Foo Task Callback: Processed FooTaskArgs but with unexpected widget value: ..." , it confirms the vulnerability. If it prints "Bar Task Callback: Processed BarTaskArgs correctly." then it's even worse as it executed the wrong callback entirely (which is less likely given the code structure, but worth considering).
