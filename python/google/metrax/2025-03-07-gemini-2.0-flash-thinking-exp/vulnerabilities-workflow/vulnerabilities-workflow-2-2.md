- Vulnerability Name: Potential Precision Loss in Metric Counts

- Description:
    1. The metrics `RSQUARED`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, and `Perplexity` in `metrax` library use `jnp.float32` to store accumulated counts for metrics calculation, such as true positives, false positives, number of samples, etc., instead of using integer types like `jnp.int32` or `jnp.int64`.
    2. When these metrics are used to evaluate models on large datasets, the accumulated counts can become very large. Due to the limited precision of `float32`, incrementing a large `float32` value by a small amount (like 1) might not result in an actual change in the floating-point representation. This is because the gap between representable floating-point numbers increases as the numbers get larger.
    3. This precision loss in count accumulation can lead to inaccurate metric calculations, especially for metrics that depend on these counts (e.g., Precision, Recall, AUC, Perplexity). The final metric value computed might deviate from the true value due to the accumulated rounding errors and precision limitations.

- Impact:
    - Incorrect metric calculations for `RSQUARED`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, and `Perplexity` metrics, especially when used on large datasets.
    - Misleading evaluation of model performance. Users might make incorrect conclusions about their models based on these inaccurate metrics.
    - Potential for flawed decision-making in applications relying on these metrics for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, or performance monitoring in production systems.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code initializes and updates count variables as `jnp.float32` without any explicit mitigation for potential precision loss during accumulation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Change the data type for count variables (e.g., `true_positives`, `false_positives`, `count`, `num_samples`) in `RSQUARED`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, and `Perplexity` metrics from `jnp.float32` to `jnp.int32` or `jnp.int64`. Integer types are designed for counting and do not suffer from the same precision loss issues as floating-point types when incrementing whole numbers.

- Preconditions:
    - Using `metrax` library to calculate `RSQUARED`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, or `Perplexity` metrics.
    - Evaluating model performance on a sufficiently large dataset such that the accumulated counts in the metrics become large enough to be affected by `float32` precision limitations.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/metrax/metrics.py`
    - In the `empty` class methods and `merge` methods for `RSQUARED`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, and `Perplexity` classes, observe the initialization and accumulation of count variables.
    - For example, in `Precision.empty()`:
      ```python
      @classmethod
      def empty(cls) -> 'Precision':
        return cls(
          true_positives=jnp.array(0, jnp.float32),
          false_positives=jnp.array(0, jnp.float32))
      ```
    - In `Precision.merge()`:
      ```python
      def merge(self, other: 'Precision') -> 'Precision':
        return type(self)(
            true_positives=self.true_positives + other.true_positives,
            false_positives=self.false_positives + other.false_positives,
        )
      ```
    - Similar patterns are observed in `RSQUARED`, `Recall`, `AUCPR`, `AUCROC`, and `Perplexity` for their respective count variables. The counts are consistently initialized as `jnp.array(0, jnp.float32)` and accumulated using addition, which can lead to precision loss over large datasets.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Import `metrax` metrics and `jax.numpy` as `jnp`.
        - Define a large number of iterations, e.g., `num_iterations = 2**25`.
        - Initialize two `Precision` metric instances: `precision_float32` (using original `metrax` code) and `precision_int32` (hypothetical modified `metrax` code where counts are `int32`). For the purpose of demonstration, we will manually simulate the behavior of `precision_int32` by casting to `int32` in the update step of the test case.
        - Initialize dummy `predictions` and `labels` arrays for metric updates (e.g., `predictions = jnp.array([1])`, `labels = jnp.array([1])`).

    2. **Iteration and Accumulation:**
        - Loop `num_iterations` times:
            - Update `precision_float32` using `metrax.Precision.from_model_output(predictions=predictions, labels=labels)`. For subsequent iterations, merge the new update with the existing `precision_float32` metric.
            - For `precision_int32`, simulate integer count accumulation. Keep track of true positives and false positives as integers and update them in each iteration as if `metrax` was using integer types internally.

    3. **Compute and Compare:**
        - After the loop, compute the precision for both `precision_float32` and `precision_int32` using `.compute()`.
        - Compare the computed precision values. Due to precision loss in `float32` accumulation, `precision_float32.compute()` might be noticeably different from `precision_int32.compute()`.

    4. **Code Example (Conceptual Test Case):**
       ```python
       import metrax
       import jax.numpy as jnp

       num_iterations = 2**25
       predictions = jnp.array([1.0])
       labels = jnp.array([1])

       # Test with original float32 counts
       precision_float32 = metrax.Precision.empty()
       for _ in range(num_iterations):
           update = metrax.Precision.from_model_output(predictions=predictions, labels=labels)
           precision_float32 = precision_float32.merge(update)
       precision_float32_value = precision_float32.compute()
       print(f"Precision (float32 counts): {precision_float32_value}")

       # Simulate test with int32 counts (manual simulation for demonstration)
       tp_int32 = 0
       fp_int32 = 0
       for _ in range(num_iterations):
           tp_int32 += int(jnp.sum((predictions >= 0.5) & (labels == 1))) # Simulate TP increment
           fp_int32 += int(jnp.sum((predictions >= 0.5) & (labels == 0))) # Simulate FP increment

       def safe_divide(x, y):
           return jnp.where(y != 0, jnp.divide(x, y), 0.0)

       precision_int32_value_simulated = safe_divide(tp_int32, (tp_int32 + fp_int32))
       print(f"Precision (simulated int32 counts): {precision_int32_value_simulated}")

       # Compare precision_float32_value and precision_int32_value_simulated
       print(f"Difference: {precision_float32_value - precision_int32_value_simulated}")
       ```
       - Run this test case. Observe if there is a noticeable difference between `precision_float32_value` and `precision_int32_value_simulated`. A significant difference would indicate precision loss in the original `float32` count accumulation. Note: The dummy example is constructed to maximize True Positives to quickly inflate the counts and expose the precision issue. A more realistic test might involve a dataset with a mix of TP, FP, etc., but the core principle of accumulating counts and observing float32 precision limitations remains the same.
