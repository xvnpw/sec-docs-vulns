- Vulnerability Name: Malicious GDB script injection via social engineering
- Description:
    - An attacker crafts a modified version of the `gcore_point.py` script. This malicious script contains arbitrary code in addition to the intended functionality of the original script.
    - The attacker employs social engineering techniques to deceive a developer into using this malicious script instead of the legitimate one. This could involve various methods, such as:
        - Hosting the malicious script on a look-alike repository or website.
        - Distributing the malicious script via email or messaging platforms, posing as a legitimate update or bug fix.
        - Convincing the developer through communication to download and use the attacker's script.
    - The developer, unaware of the script's malicious nature and believing it to be the correct `gcore_point.py` script, sources it into their GDB session using the `source gcore_point.py` command within GDB.
    - Upon sourcing the script, the malicious code embedded within it is executed in the context of the developer's GDB session.
    - As GDB runs with the privileges of the developer executing it, the malicious code inherits these privileges and can perform actions with them. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. This can have severe consequences, including:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data from the developer's machine, including source code, credentials, and personal files, could be stolen.
    - Malware installation: The attacker could install malware, such as spyware, ransomware, or backdoors, on the developer's system, leading to persistent compromise.
    - Development environment compromise: The attacker could gain control over the development environment, potentially injecting malicious code into projects, compromising build systems, or gaining access to further internal systems accessible from the developer's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The provided project does not include any mechanisms to prevent the use of a modified, malicious version of the `gcore_point.py` script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Code integrity checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of the `gcore_point.py` script. This could involve:
        - Digital signatures: Signing the script with a trusted key to ensure its origin and prevent tampering.
        - Checksums or hashes: Providing checksums or cryptographic hashes of the legitimate script for developers to verify against downloaded versions.
    - Secure distribution: Emphasize secure distribution channels for the script, such as:
        - Official repository: Clearly direct users to download the script from the official project repository.
        - Signed releases: Offer signed releases of the script to guarantee authenticity.
    - User education: Educate developers about the security risks associated with sourcing untrusted GDB scripts. This includes:
        - Warning developers about the potential for malicious scripts to execute arbitrary code.
        - Advising developers to always review the contents of any GDB script before sourcing it, especially if obtained from untrusted sources.
        - Recommending downloading scripts only from the official project repository or trusted sources.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to create a modified, malicious version of the `gcore_point.py` script.
    - The attacker must successfully socially engineer a developer into downloading and using the malicious script.
    - The developer must have GDB installed and must use the `source` command within a GDB session to load the malicious script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `gcore_point.py` script is written in Python and is intended to be sourced into a GDB session using the `source` command.
    - The `source` command in GDB directly executes the Python code within the specified script file.
    - There are no built-in security mechanisms in GDB to sandbox or restrict the actions of a sourced Python script.
    - Any Python code included in the `gcore_point.py` file, including malicious code, will be executed with the privileges of the GDB process, which in turn runs with the privileges of the user executing GDB.
    - For example, if an attacker modifies `gcore_point.py` to include the following lines at the beginning of the file:
      ```python
      import os
      os.system("whoami > /tmp/pwned_user.txt")
      ```
      When a developer sources this modified script in GDB, the `os.system("whoami > /tmp/pwned_user.txt")` command will be executed immediately. This command will write the username of the developer running GDB to the file `/tmp/pwned_user.txt`, demonstrating arbitrary command execution.
    - The rest of the script defines classes and a GDB command, which are intended functionalities. However, any code outside these definitions at the top level of the script will be executed upon sourcing.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Prepare a testing environment with GDB installed.
        - Obtain the original `gcore_point.py` script from a trusted source (e.g., the official repository).
        - Create a malicious version of `gcore_point.py`. For this test, insert the following malicious code at the very beginning of the file:
          ```python
          import os
          MALICIOUS_FILE = "/tmp/gcore_point_pwned"
          if not os.path.exists(MALICIOUS_FILE):
              with open(MALICIOUS_FILE, "w") as f:
                  f.write("You have been PWNED by malicious gcore_point.py script!\n")
          ```
          This code will create a file named `/tmp/gcore_point_pwned` if it doesn't already exist, writing a simple message to it. This serves as a detectable indicator of successful malicious code execution.
        - Save the malicious script as `malicious_gcore_point.py` in a location accessible to the test environment.
        - Compile a simple C program with debug symbols for use with GDB (as shown in the README example or any other simple debuggable program).
    2. Execution:
        - Open GDB on the compiled C program: `gdb <test_program_executable>`
        - Source the malicious script within GDB: `(gdb) source malicious_gcore_point.py`
    3. Verification:
        - After sourcing the script, check for the presence of the indicator file created by the malicious code. In this case, check if the file `/tmp/gcore_point_pwned` exists and contains the expected message:
          ```bash
          ls /tmp/gcore_point_pwned
          cat /tmp/gcore_point_pwned
          ```
        - If the file `/tmp/gcore_point_pwned` exists and contains the message "You have been PWNED by malicious gcore_point.py script!", it confirms that the malicious code embedded in `malicious_gcore_point.py` was successfully executed when the script was sourced into GDB. This demonstrates the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
