#### 1. Information Disclosure via Unprotected Core Files
- **Description:**
    1. A user utilizes the `gcore-point` GDB command, introduced by the provided Python script, to set breakpoints in a program being debugged.
    2. When these breakpoints are triggered during program execution, the `gcore-point` script automatically generates core files. These files are stored in the current working directory from where GDB is executed.
    3. If the directory where GDB is run and core files are generated is publicly accessible, improperly configured, or lacks sufficient security measures, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access.
    4. An attacker could then download and examine these core files.
    5. Core files are memory dumps of the debugged process at the time of breakpoint hit. They can contain sensitive information, including but not limited to: application secrets, API keys, passwords, cryptographic keys, user data, and other confidential business information that was present in the process's memory.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information contained within the generated core dump files. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and compromise of confidential information, depending on the sensitivity of the data exposed in the core dumps.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The script itself does not implement any mitigations for the security risks associated with core file generation and storage.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Enhancement:** The documentation should be updated to explicitly warn users about the security implications of using `gcore-point`. It should highlight the risk of sensitive information exposure through core files and strongly recommend secure handling of these files. The documentation should advise users to:
        - Generate core files in secure directories with restricted access permissions.
        - Implement access control mechanisms to protect core files from unauthorized access.
        - Consider the sensitivity of the data being processed by the debugged application and the potential risks of exposing this data in core files.
    - **Secure File Handling Guidance:** Provide guidance or best practices for secure handling of generated core files, including suggesting secure storage locations and recommending appropriate file system permissions to restrict access.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must have access to the file system where the GDB process is running and where core files are generated. This could be due to misconfigured file permissions, a compromised system, or other access control vulnerabilities.
    - A user must have used the `gcore-point` command to generate core files while debugging a process that handles sensitive information.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `CoreDumpBP.stop` method, the core file name is constructed: `core_file_name = f"core.{core_name_prefix}{inferior.pid}.{self.hit_count}"`.
    - The `gdb.execute(f"gcore {core_file_name}")` command is then directly executed.
    - The `gcore` command, by default, saves the generated core file in the current working directory where GDB is running.
    - The script lacks any functionality to control the destination path or permissions of the generated core files.
    - There are no security checks or warnings within the script to alert users about potential information disclosure risks.
    ```python
    class CoreDumpBP(gdb.Breakpoint):
        # ...
        def stop(self):
            # ...
            core_file_name = f"core.{core_name_prefix}{inferior.pid}.{self.hit_count}"
            GCoreOnStop(core_file_name) # Event triggers gcore execution
            return True

    class GCoreOnStop(GDBEventOneShot):
        # ...
        def run_event(self):
            gdb.execute(f"gcore {self._file_name}") # Executes gcore command
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a test program (e.g., in C or Python) that handles sensitive data, such as reading an API key from an environment variable and storing it in a variable in memory. Compile the program with debug symbols (`-g`).
    2. **Environment:** Ensure a test environment where you can run GDB and generate files, and where you can simulate an attacker having access to the file system (e.g., a shared directory or a system where permissions can be manipulated for testing).
    3. **Run GDB:** Start GDB and load the test program: `gdb <test_program>`.
    4. **Source Script:** Source the `gcore_point.py` script within GDB: `(gdb) source gcore_point.py`.
    5. **Set Breakpoint:** Set a `gcore-point` at a line in the code where the sensitive data is expected to be in memory (e.g., after the API key is read into a variable): `(gdb) gcore-point <source_file>:<line_number> sensitive_data_breakpoint`.
    6. **Run Program:** Run the test program in GDB: `(gdb) run`. The breakpoint should be hit, and a core file `core.sensitive_data_breakpoint.<pid>.<hit_count>` will be generated in the current directory.
    7. **Simulate Attacker Access:** As an attacker, access the directory where GDB was run and locate the generated core file. Copy or download this core file to an attacker-controlled machine.
    8. **Analyze Core File:** Open the core file using GDB on the attacker's machine: `gdb <test_program> <core_file>`.
    9. **Examine Memory:** In GDB, examine the memory around the location where the sensitive data was expected to be stored. For example, if the sensitive data was in a variable named `api_key`, try to print its value or examine the memory region it occupies: `(gdb) print api_key` or `(gdb) x/s &api_key`.
    10. **Verification:** Verify if the sensitive data (e.g., the API key) is present in the core dump and can be retrieved by examining the core file. If the sensitive data is recoverable from the core file, this confirms the information disclosure vulnerability.
