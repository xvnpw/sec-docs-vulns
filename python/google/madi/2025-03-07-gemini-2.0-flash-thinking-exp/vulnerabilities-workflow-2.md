### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Data Poisoning via Dataset File Replacement

*   **Description:**
    1.  MADI loads datasets from CSV files that are packaged within the library itself (e.g., `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` for SmartBuildingsDataset and `covtype.data` for ForestCoverDataset).
    2.  An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the installation directory of the MADI Python package or to the distribution mechanism (e.g., PyPI if the attacker can compromise the package distribution).
    3.  The attacker replaces the original dataset CSV file with a modified version. This modified version contains subtly manipulated data points designed to bias the anomaly detection model. For instance, in the context of the Smart Buildings dataset, an attacker might inject data representing anomalous sensor readings but label them as normal (`class_label = 1`).
    4.  When MADI is used to train or run anomaly detection using the compromised dataset, it will unknowingly use the poisoned data.
    5.  Consequently, the anomaly detection model learns from the poisoned data and becomes biased. It may start to classify real anomalous data points, which are similar to the injected poisoned data, as normal behavior. Over time, this degrades the effectiveness of the anomaly detection system, allowing attackers to evade detection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Anomaly Detection Accuracy:** The primary impact is a decrease in the accuracy of the anomaly detection system. The model becomes less effective at identifying true anomalies because it has been trained on data that misrepresents normal behavior.
    *   **Evasion of Detection:** Attackers can successfully inject malicious activities into the system without being detected. For example, in a smart building scenario, a device failure or security breach might be misclassified as normal operation.
    *   **Compromised System Integrity:** The integrity of the entire system that relies on MADI for anomaly detection is compromised. Decisions and actions based on the output of the model will be unreliable.
    *   **Long-Term Degradation:** The effects of data poisoning can be persistent and difficult to reverse. Retraining the model on clean data might be necessary to restore its accuracy.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The current project does not implement any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the dataset files. The code directly loads and uses the CSV files as they are found within the package.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Data Integrity Verification:** Implement checksum verification for dataset files. Upon loading a dataset, the system should calculate the checksum of the file and compare it against a known, trusted checksum. This can detect if the file has been tampered with.
    *   **Secure Package Management:** Promote best practices for secure package distribution and installation to prevent attackers from compromising the package repository or installation process. For example, using signed packages and secure installation channels.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Applicability for Packaged Datasets):** While less directly applicable to packaged datasets, general input validation practices are important for data pipelines. If the system were to load external data at runtime (which is not the case in the provided code), rigorous input validation and sanitization would be crucial to prevent data poisoning through external data sources.
    *   **Data Monitoring and Drift Detection:** Implement monitoring of the dataset and model performance over time. Significant drifts in data distribution or model accuracy could be indicators of data poisoning attacks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   **Write Access to Installation Directory or Distribution Mechanism:** The attacker must gain write access to the directory where the MADI Python package is installed or be able to compromise the package distribution system (e.g., PyPI for public packages, or internal package repositories for private deployments). The level of access required depends on the deployment environment and how MADI is distributed and installed. For local installations, write access to the Python environment's site-packages directory might suffice. For wider distribution, compromising the package repository would have a broader impact.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **`src/madi/datasets/smart_buildings_dataset.py`:**
        ```python
        _RESOURCE_LOCATION = "madi.datasets.data"
        _DATA_FILE = file_utils.PackageResource(
            _RESOURCE_LOCATION, "anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv")
        ...
        class SmartBuildingsDataset(BaseDataset):
          ...
          def __init__(self,
                       datafilepath: _FileType = _DATA_FILE,
                       readmefilepath: _FileType = _README_FILE):
            self._sample = self._load_data_file(datafilepath)
            ...
          def _load_data_file(self, datafile: _FileType) -> pd.DataFrame:
            with file_utils.open_text_resource(datafile) as csv_file:
              sample = pd.read_csv(csv_file, header="infer", index_col=0)
            return sample.reindex(np.random.permutation(sample.index))
        ```
        The `SmartBuildingsDataset` class loads data from `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` using `file_utils.PackageResource`. The `_load_data_file` method simply reads the CSV content into a pandas DataFrame without any integrity checks.

    *   **`src/madi/datasets/forestcover_dataset.py`:**
        ```python
        _DATA_FILE = 'covtype.data'
        ...
        class ForestCoverDataset(BaseDataset):
          ...
          def __init__(self, data_dir):
            ...
            datafile_in = os.path.join(data_dir, _DATA_FILE)
            ...
            with tf.io.gfile.GFile(datafile_in) as csv_file:
              input_df = pd.read_csv(
                  csv_file, names=_COL_NAMES_ALL, usecols=_COL_NAMES_SELECT)
            ...
        ```
        Similarly, `ForestCoverDataset` loads data from `covtype.data`. Although it involves downloading the data initially, once downloaded, the file in `data_dir` is used directly without further verification in subsequent uses.

    *   **`src/madi/utils/file_utils.py`:**
        ```python
        @open_text_resource.register(PackageResource)
        def _(path: PackageResource) -> TextIOContextManager:
          return importlib_resources.open_text(path.package, path.resource)
        ```
        `file_utils.open_text_resource` for `PackageResource` simply opens the resource using `importlib.resources.open_text`. There's no data validation or integrity check happening in this utility function.

    *   **Visualization:**
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
        A[MADI Application Start] --> B{Load Dataset};
        B --> C[file_utils.PackageResource or tf.io.gfile.GFile];
        C --> D[Dataset CSV File (e.g., anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv)];
        D -- Modified by Attacker --> E[Poisoned Dataset Loaded];
        E --> F[Anomaly Detection Model Training/Prediction];
        F --> G[Biased Anomaly Detection Results];
        ```
        The diagram illustrates the data flow. The attacker modifies the dataset file, which is then loaded by MADI without integrity checks, leading to biased anomaly detection results.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Environment Setup:** Set up a Python environment and install the MADI package.
    2.  **Locate Dataset File:** Find the location of the `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` file within the installed MADI package (typically in the `site-packages/madi/datasets/data/` directory).
    3.  **Backup Original Dataset:** Create a backup copy of the original `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` file in case you need to restore it later.
    4.  **Poison Dataset:** Open `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` in a text editor or programmatically using Python.
        *   Identify a set of data points in the CSV that represent 'normal' behavior (class\_label = 1).
        *   Modify these data points to represent 'anomalous' behavior, but crucially, **keep the `class_label` as 1**. For example, if 'data:zone\_air\_temperature\_sensor' typically ranges from 290 to 300, change some values to 320 or higher, while ensuring the `class_label` for these modified rows remains 1.  Inject around 10-20 poisoned data points.
        *   Save the modified `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` file, overwriting the original in the installation directory.
    5.  **Run MADI with Poisoned Dataset:** Execute a Python script that uses MADI to train and test an anomaly detection model using the `SmartBuildingsDataset`. The example below demonstrates how to do this programmatically:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from madi.datasets import SmartBuildingsDataset
        from madi.detectors import NegativeSamplingNeuralNetworkAD
        from madi.utils import evaluation_utils

        # Load the (poisoned) dataset
        ds = SmartBuildingsDataset()
        sample = ds.sample

        # Split into training and testing
        split_ix = int(len(sample) * 0.8)
        training_sample = sample.iloc[:split_ix]
        test_sample = sample.iloc[split_ix:]

        # Initialize and train the anomaly detector
        ad = NegativeSamplingNeuralNetworkAD(
            sample_ratio=3.0,
            sample_delta=0.05,
            batch_size=32,
            steps_per_epoch=16,
            epochs=1, # Reduced epochs for quick test
            dropout=0.5,
            learning_rate=0.001,
            layer_width=64,
            n_hidden_layers=2,
            patience=5,
            log_dir='./tmp_log')

        ad.train_model(x_train=training_sample.drop(columns=['class_label']))

        # Predict on the test sample
        y_actual = test_sample['class_label']
        xy_predicted = ad.predict(test_sample.drop(columns=['class_label']))

        # Evaluate AUC
        auc = evaluation_utils.compute_auc(
            y_actual=y_actual, y_predicted=xy_predicted['class_prob'])
        print(f"AUC with poisoned data: {auc}")

        # To compare, run the same test with the original dataset (restore from backup)
        # and observe the AUC difference. A successful poisoning attack will likely
        # show a lower AUC or a model that misclassifies injected anomalous data
        # as normal, if you can craft a specific test case for that.
        ```
    6.  **Observe Model Behavior:** Run the script and observe the AUC score and the model's classification performance. Compare the results with a run using the original, unpoisoned dataset. A successful data poisoning attack will typically result in:
        *   A potentially lower AUC score, indicating degraded overall anomaly detection performance.
        *   The model may start to misclassify data points similar to the injected poisoned data as normal. To explicitly test this, you can create a separate test dataset containing data points that are clearly anomalous (similar to the poisoned data you injected) and see if the model, trained on the poisoned dataset, now classifies these as normal.

    7.  **Restore Original Dataset (Cleanup):** Replace the poisoned `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599.csv` file with the backup you created in step 3 to restore the system to its original state.

This test case demonstrates that by replacing the dataset file with a poisoned version, an attacker can influence the training data and potentially degrade the anomaly detection capabilities of MADI.

#### 2. Insufficient Input Data Validation

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts malicious telemetry data with values that are outside the expected normal operating ranges or in unexpected formats.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious data into the MADI system's telemetry input stream, as if it were legitimate device telemetry.
    3. The MADI system's data processing pipeline receives this data.
    4. Due to the absence of input validation, the system does not check if the incoming telemetry data conforms to expected data types, value ranges, or formats.
    5. The malicious data is passed directly to the anomaly detection model, potentially after normalization based on training data.
    6. The anomaly detection model, trained on normal data ranges, may misclassify the injected malicious data as normal because it is not designed to handle or flag out-of-range or malformed inputs at the input stage.
    7. As a result, the malicious telemetry data evades detection by the MADI system.
    8. Real device failures that occur simultaneously with or after the injection of malicious data may also be masked, as the system is now operating under the false assumption that all telemetry data is normal.

*   **Impact:**
    - Successful injection of malicious telemetry data that evades anomaly detection.
    - Masking of real device failures, preventing timely intervention and potentially leading to system outage, damage, or incorrect operational decisions based on faulty data.
    - Reduced trust in the anomaly detection system's reliability and ability to safeguard IoT devices.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. A review of the provided source code reveals no explicit input validation mechanisms implemented within the data ingestion or processing stages of the MADI system.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust input validation at the point where telemetry data enters the MADI system.
    - Validation should include checks for:
        - **Data Type Validation**: Ensure that each telemetry parameter conforms to the expected data type (e.g., numeric, integer, float).
        - **Range Validation**: Verify that the values for each parameter fall within the predefined acceptable minimum and maximum ranges based on normal device operation.
        - **Format Validation**: Confirm that the overall data format and structure adhere to the expected schema (e.g., expected fields, units of measurement).
    - Implement logging and alerting for invalid telemetry data to signal potential attacks or data integrity issues.
    - Consider implementing data sanitization or rejection policies for telemetry data that fails validation checks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - The MADI system is deployed and operational, monitoring IoT telemetry data.
    - The MADI system is accessible to external entities capable of injecting telemetry data, either directly or indirectly (e.g., compromised device sending data).
    - The anomaly detection model is trained and actively used for real-time monitoring.
    - No input validation is configured or active in the deployed MADI system.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Examination of the provided Python code files, particularly within `/code/src/madi/datasets/`, `/code/src/madi/detectors/`, and `/code/src/madi/utils/`, reveals no explicit functions or code blocks dedicated to validating incoming telemetry data against predefined rules or schemas before it is processed by the anomaly detection models.
    - The data loading processes in dataset classes like `SmartBuildingsDataset` and `ForestCoverDataset` focus on reading data from files or downloading datasets, and do not include runtime validation of new incoming data.
    - The normalization functions in `sample_utils.py` are applied *after* data is loaded and accepted, and are intended for scaling data for model training and prediction, not for initial data validation and sanitization.
    - The anomaly detection algorithms in `/code/src/madi/detectors/` expect pre-processed and normalized data as input for `train_model()` and `predict()` functions, implying that input validation is assumed to be handled externally or is not considered within the scope of these components.
    - **Visualization:** No specific visualization is needed for this vulnerability, as it is a code inspection finding rather than a complex code flow issue. The absence of validation code is the key indicator.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the MADI project, ensuring that the anomaly detection system is running with a trained model (e.g., using `NegativeSamplingNeuralNetworkAD` on `SmartBuildingsDataset`).
    2. Determine the expected telemetry data format and normal operating ranges for the monitored IoT devices. This can be inferred from dataset descriptions (e.g., `anomaly_detection_sample_1577622599_README.md` for `SmartBuildingsDataset`) or by analyzing the training dataset itself. For instance, identify the typical range for 'zone air temperature sensor' in Kelvin.
    3. Craft a malicious telemetry data sample. This sample should include at least one sensor reading that is significantly outside the normal operating range. For example, create a data point where 'data:zone_air_temperature_sensor' is set to an extremely low or high value (e.g., -50 degrees Celsius or 150 degrees Celsius when normal is around 22 degrees Celsius, converted to Kelvin for the system if needed). Ensure other parameters are within a plausible range to avoid obvious data corruption flags if any basic checks exist.
    4. Inject this crafted telemetry data into the MADI system through its publicly exposed telemetry data ingestion endpoint. This would simulate an external attacker sending malicious data.
    5. Monitor the MADI system's anomaly detection output for the injected data point. Observe the 'class_prob' or equivalent anomaly score for this data point.
    6. Expected Result: Verify that the MADI system classifies the injected malicious data point as normal (i.e., 'class_prob' is close to 1.0 or anomaly score is low), despite the sensor reading being drastically out of the expected range. This confirms the insufficient input data validation vulnerability, as the system failed to recognize and flag the obviously anomalous data.
    7. If the system incorrectly classifies the out-of-range data as normal, the test case is successful in demonstrating the vulnerability. If the system flags it as anomalous, then there might be some implicit or unconfirmed validation in place or the anomaly model is unexpectedly robust to this specific type of out-of-range data, requiring further investigation or refinement of the malicious data crafting.
