* Vulnerability Name: Quantization-induced Model Accuracy Degradation against Adversarial Examples
* Description:
    1.  A machine learning model is designed and trained using floating-point arithmetic, achieving a certain level of robustness against adversarial examples.
    2.  To optimize the model for deployment (e.g., reduce size, increase inference speed), the model's weights and activations are quantized using AQT (Accurate Quantized Training). This process converts floating-point tensors to lower-bitwidth integer or reduced-precision floating-point representations (like int8, int4, int2, int1 or FP8).
    3.  Quantization inherently reduces the precision of tensor operations, leading to information loss and approximation errors in the quantized model compared to the original floating-point model.
    4.  An attacker, aware that the deployed model is quantized using AQT, crafts adversarial examples. These are inputs meticulously designed to be close to legitimate inputs but engineered to cause misclassification by exploiting the model's decision boundaries.
    5.  Due to the reduced precision from quantization, the decision boundaries of the quantized model become more brittle and sensitive to perturbations. This makes the quantized model more vulnerable to adversarial examples than the original floating-point model.
    6.  The attacker injects these adversarial examples into the deployed, quantized machine learning model.
    7.  The quantized model, now less robust due to the quantization-induced precision loss, incorrectly classifies the adversarial examples, leading to potentially harmful or unintended outcomes depending on the application.
* Impact:
    - Significant reduction in model accuracy when processing adversarial examples compared to the original floating-point model.
    - Security implications arise in applications where model correctness and reliability are paramount, as attackers can strategically manipulate inputs to force the model to produce erroneous outputs. This could be critical in safety-sensitive systems or applications where incorrect predictions can lead to financial loss or reputational damage.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Accurate Quantized Training Focus:** AQT's core design principle is "Accurate Quantized Training," which aims to minimize accuracy loss during the quantization process. The project provides tools and techniques to train models directly in a quantized manner, attempting to retain as much accuracy as possible compared to full-precision training. However, this focus is primarily on general accuracy and might not specifically address robustness against adversarial examples.
    - **WYTIWYS (What You Train Is What You Serve):** AQT ensures bit-exact consistency between the quantized models used during training and serving. The documentation highlights, "AQT quantized models are bit-exact the same during training and serving." This eliminates training-serving skew, a common problem in quantization, but doesn't inherently improve adversarial robustness. It ensures that any robustness (or lack thereof) learned during training is preserved in deployment.
    - **Flexible Quantization Configurations:** AQT offers a wide range of configurable quantization parameters (e.g., bitwidths, quantization schemes, calibration methods). This flexibility allows users to potentially tune quantization settings to find a trade-off between performance and robustness. Users could experiment with higher bitwidths or different calibration strategies to improve robustness, but no default "secure" configuration is enforced, and the project doesn't provide explicit guidance on how to choose parameters for better adversarial robustness.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Lack of Adversarial Robustness Techniques:** The AQT project does not currently incorporate any explicit techniques specifically designed to enhance adversarial robustness. Methods like adversarial training, defensive distillation, input preprocessing, or certified robustness techniques are not part of the AQT library.
    - **Absence of Robustness Evaluation Tools:**  AQT lacks built-in tools or metrics to evaluate the adversarial robustness of quantized models. There are no functions or utilities provided to assess how much model vulnerability to adversarial examples increases after quantization. Users would need to integrate external adversarial attack and defense libraries to perform such evaluations.
    - **No Guidance on Robustness-Performance Trade-off:** The project does not offer guidelines or best practices for users to navigate the trade-off between model performance (speed, size) and adversarial robustness when using AQT. There's no documentation or tooling to help users select quantization configurations that strike a balance between these competing objectives.
* Preconditions:
    - **Model Quantization with AQT:** A machine learning model must be quantized using the AQT library. The vulnerability is directly related to the quantization process introduced by AQT.
    - **Deployment in Adversarial Environment:** The quantized model needs to be deployed in an environment where it is exposed to potentially malicious or adversarial inputs. This is typical in many real-world deployment scenarios, especially for publicly accessible models or systems interacting with untrusted users or data sources.
    - **Attacker's Knowledge of AQT:** For a targeted attack, the attacker benefits from knowing that the model is quantized using AQT and understanding the general quantization techniques employed. This knowledge allows for crafting more effective adversarial examples tailored to the weaknesses introduced by quantization. However, even without specific AQT knowledge, general adversarial examples might still be effective against quantized models.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability stems from the core quantization operations within AQT, primarily implemented in:
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/aqt_quantizer.py`: This file defines the `Quantizer` classes and logic responsible for converting floating-point tensors to quantized representations. The quantization process, by its nature, introduces approximation and reduces precision, making models potentially more susceptible to adversarial perturbations.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/aqt_dot_general.py`: This file implements quantized `dot_general` operations, the fundamental building blocks of many neural network layers (like dense and convolutional layers). The `dg_core` function and related quantization logic within this file are where the reduced-precision computations are performed, directly contributing to the vulnerability. The configuration classes like `DotGeneral` and `AqtTensorConfig` control the quantization parameters (bitwidths, numerics, calibration) that influence the degree of precision loss.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_dg_core.py`: This file integrates AQT's `dot_general` into Flax using `custom_vjp` for differentiable quantization. The `dg_core_flax_lifted` function orchestrates the quantized dot product within Flax modules, making the vulnerability exploitable in Flax-based models using AQT.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax.py`: This file provides Flax layers like `AqtDotGeneral`, `AqtEinsum`, and `AqtConvGeneralDilated` that users employ to inject quantization into their Flax models. These layers are wrappers around the core quantization functions and expose the vulnerability through their usage in model definitions. For example, the `AqtDotGeneral` class, when used in a `nn.Dense` layer with a quantization configuration (`cfg`), will perform quantized matrix multiplications, making the resulting layer more vulnerable to adversarial examples.

    Floating-Point Model Input --> Floating-Point Operations --> Output (Robust)
                                    ^
                                    | Adversarial Example (Minor Impact)

    Quantized Model Input -------> Quantized Operations --------> Output (Vulnerable)
                                    ^
                                    | Adversarial Example (Major Impact due to precision loss)
    ```

    - **Code Snippet Example (Conceptual from `aqt_dot_general.py`):**

    ```python
    def dg_core(
        lhs: jnp.ndarray,
        rhs: jnp.ndarray,
        lhs_qt: None | QTensor,
        rhs_qt: None | QTensor,
        dimension_numbers: jax.lax.DotDimensionNumbers,
    ):
        if lhs_qt is not None:
            lhs = lhs_qt.quantize(lhs) # Precision Reduction
        if rhs_qt is not None:
            rhs = rhs_qt.quantize(rhs) # Precision Reduction
        return jax.lax.dot_general(lhs, rhs, dimension_numbers) # Lower precision dot_general
    ```
    This simplified snippet illustrates how `dg_core` in `aqt_dot_general.py` applies quantization (`lhs_qt.quantize`, `rhs_qt.quantize`) before performing the `dot_general` operation. This precision reduction is the root cause of the increased vulnerability to adversarial examples.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Use a standard Python environment with JAX, Flax, and TensorFlow Datasets installed, as required by the AQT project.
    2. **Baseline Model Training (Floating-Point):**
        - Define a simple image classification model using Flax (e.g., similar to the MNIST CNN example in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model.py` or `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/cnn/cnn_model.py`).
        - Train this model on a dataset like MNIST or CIFAR10 using standard floating-point operations, without AQT quantization.
        - Evaluate the accuracy of this baseline floating-point model on a clean test set and record the "clean accuracy".
        - Generate a set of adversarial examples for the test set using an established attack method like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (using libraries like Foolbox, CleverHans, or ART).
        - Evaluate the accuracy of the floating-point model on these adversarial examples and record the "adversarial accuracy" for the floating-point baseline.
    3. **Quantized Model Creation and Evaluation:**
        - Modify the Flax model definition to incorporate AQT quantization. Inject `AqtDotGeneral` and/or `AqtConvGeneralDilated` layers with a chosen quantization configuration (e.g., `config.config_v4()` for int8 quantization or a lower bitwidth configuration). Refer to examples in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/examples` for guidance.
        - Train the AQT-quantized model (or, alternatively, perform post-training quantization by converting the pre-trained floating-point model using AQT's conversion tools as demonstrated in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model.py`).
        - Evaluate the clean accuracy of the quantized model on the same clean test set used for the baseline. Verify that the clean accuracy is reasonably maintained after quantization (as per AQT's design goal of "accurate quantization").
        - Generate adversarial examples for the test set, using the same attack method (FGSM or PGD) and parameters as in step 2, but now targeting the quantized model.
        - Evaluate the adversarial accuracy of the quantized model on these newly generated adversarial examples. Record the "adversarial accuracy" for the quantized model.
    4. **Accuracy Comparison and Vulnerability Demonstration:**
        - Compare the adversarial accuracy of the floating-point model and the quantized model.
        - Expect to observe a significant drop in adversarial accuracy for the quantized model compared to the floating-point baseline. This drop demonstrates the vulnerability: quantization using AQT, while aiming for accuracy and performance, can reduce the model's robustness against adversarial examples.
        - The clean accuracy should ideally be close between the floating-point and quantized models, confirming that the accuracy drop is specifically in adversarial robustness, not general accuracy.

    **Expected Outcome:** The security test case should clearly show that the AQT-quantized model exhibits a lower adversarial accuracy compared to the original floating-point model when evaluated against the same type of adversarial examples. This demonstrates the quantization-induced vulnerability.

    **Assumptions for the test case (as previously stated):**
    - External attacker with access to a publicly available instance of the project (e.g., a deployed ML model quantized using AQT).
    - Attacker has the ability to craft and send inputs to the deployed model.
    - Attacker is aware that the model is quantized using AQT.
