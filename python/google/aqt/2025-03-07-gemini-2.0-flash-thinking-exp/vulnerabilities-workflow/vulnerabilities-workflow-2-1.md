- Vulnerability Name: Numerical Instability due to Quantization
- Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts an adversarial input designed to maximize the numerical instability introduced by quantization.
  - Step 2: This input is fed into a model that uses the AQT library for quantization.
  - Step 3: Due to the reduced numerical precision of quantized tensors, the adversarial input triggers significant deviations in the model's internal computations.
  - Step 4: These deviations can lead to misclassification of the adversarial input or a general reduction in the model's accuracy when processing such inputs.
- Impact:
  - Reduced model accuracy for adversarial inputs.
  - Model misbehavior when processing adversarial inputs.
  - Potential security implications if the model is used in security-sensitive applications.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The library offers flexible quantization configurations and calibration algorithms (described in `/code/aqt/common/aqt_config.py`, `/code/aqt/common/aqt_config_utils.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/config.py`).
  - AQTv2 is the recommended library (mentioned in `/code/README.md`), suggesting ongoing improvements in quantization quality.
  - The project includes testing code (`/code/aqt/common/aqt_config_schedule_test.py`, `/code/aqt/jax_legacy/utils/tfevent_utils_test.py`, `/code/aqt/jax_legacy/utils/pandas_utils_test.py`, `/code/aqt/jax_legacy/utils/aqt_config_schedule_test.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py`) and examples (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/examples.ipynb`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples/flax_e2e_intercept_model_test.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples/flax_e2e_intercept_model.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/cnn/`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model_test.py`) that implicitly serve as functional tests and help to ensure some level of correctness and stability under normal use cases. These tests cover different aspects of the library including einsum, freezer functionality, tiling, and end-to-end model examples, indicating a focus on verifying functional correctness which indirectly contributes to numerical stability under standard usage.
  - New calibration methods like `WeightedStatsCalibration` (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_calibration.py`) and `DelayedScalingCalibration` (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/delayed_scaling_calibration.py`) are introduced, offering more options to control quantization ranges and potentially improve numerical stability. These methods, along with the existing `MeanOfAbsMaxCalibration` (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_calibration.py`), provide flexibility in choosing calibration strategies that might be more robust against adversarial inputs.
  - The introduction of tiling functionality (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/tiled_dot_general.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py`, examples in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples/flax_e2e_intercept_model_test.py` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model_test.py`) might indirectly improve numerical stability in some cases by changing the order of operations in large matrix multiplications, although this is not a primary security mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Lack of specific adversarial input detection mechanisms.
  - Absence of explicit robustness mechanisms against adversarial inputs.
  - No clear guidelines for selecting quantization configurations robust to adversarial attacks.
- Preconditions:
  - A model using the AQT library is deployed and publicly accessible.
  - The attacker has knowledge of the model architecture and AQT quantization scheme.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - Vulnerability lies in quantization functions within `/code/aqt/jax/v2` (e.g., `aqt_tensor.py`, `numerics/int_numerics.py`, `numerics/emulated_floating_points.py`). The core numerical instability stems from the reduced precision inherent in integer and lower-bit floating-point representations used during quantization.
  - Configuration files in `/code/aqt/common` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2` (`aqt_config.py`, `aqt_config_utils.py`, `config.py`) define quantization parameters, but do not inherently prevent numerical instability. While they allow customization, choosing robust configurations requires expert knowledge and is not directly guided by the library.
  - Files like `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_dg_core.py` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax.py` integrate AQT into Flax models, applying quantization to dot_general operations which are fundamental in neural networks. These files, especially `aqt_flax_dg_core.py`, use `jax.custom_vjp` for defining custom gradient computations for quantized operations, which is crucial for training but doesn't inherently address adversarial robustness.
  - Calibration modules like `MeanOfAbsMaxCalibration`, `WeightedStatsCalibration`, and `DelayedScalingCalibration` (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_calibration.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/delayed_scaling_calibration.py`) aim to find optimal quantization ranges based on data statistics. However, these calibrations are typically performed on normal training data and may not be robust against adversarial inputs that are designed to exploit numerical weaknesses. For example, `DelayedScalingCalibration` in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/delayed_scaling_calibration.py` maintains a history of maximum absolute values to compute bounds, which can help in dynamic ranges but doesn't directly counter adversarial attacks.
  - The `Freezer` modules (`/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/freezer.py`, `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax.py`) are designed for model conversion and serving, allowing quantized weights to be frozen and deployed. This is an optimization for inference speed and model size but does not mitigate the underlying numerical instability vulnerability. The `FreezerMode` enum and the `Freezer` class itself in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/freezer.py` control how quantization parameters are handled during different stages (training, conversion, serving).
  - Test files like `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py` and example files in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax/intercept/examples` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples` demonstrate the functionality of AQT in Flax models, including different quantization modes, tiling, and calibration. While these tests ensure the library functions as intended, they do not specifically test or mitigate robustness against adversarial examples. The examples, such as those in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/cnn/`, provide practical demonstrations of using AQT for CNNs, including training, calibration, and serving, but again, lack adversarial robustness considerations.
- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Quantize a pre-trained ResNet model using AQT with int8 quantization.
  - Step 2: Evaluate the quantized model's accuracy on a dataset of normal images.
  - Step 3: Generate adversarial images using FGSM or PGD, specifically targeting the quantized ResNet model. Tools like `foolbox` or `cleverhans` can be used to generate adversarial examples.
  - Step 4: Evaluate the quantized model's accuracy using the adversarial images.
  - Step 5: Compare the accuracy from step 2 and step 4. A notable decrease in accuracy for adversarial images confirms the vulnerability. To strengthen the test, compare the accuracy drop to a non-quantized (float32) version of the same model under the same adversarial attack. A significantly larger accuracy drop in the quantized model would further highlight the numerical instability vulnerability introduced by quantization when facing adversarial inputs.
