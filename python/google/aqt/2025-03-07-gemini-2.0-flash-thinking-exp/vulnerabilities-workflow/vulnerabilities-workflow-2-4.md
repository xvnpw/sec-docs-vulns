* Vulnerability Name: Numerical Instability in Quantized Models
* Description:
    1. AQT library is designed to quantize tensor operations to improve performance in machine learning models.
    2. Quantization, especially to lower bitwidths such as int8 or int4, reduces numerical precision, which can introduce inaccuracies compared to floating-point operations.
    3. Adversarial inputs, specifically crafted to exploit these numerical limitations, can cause a quantized model to produce significantly different or incorrect outputs compared to its floating-point counterpart.
    4. An attacker could probe a deployed model, potentially through a publicly accessible inference endpoint, with numerous inputs to identify those that trigger numerical instability, leading to model evasion (in classification tasks) or incorrect predictions (in regression or other tasks).
* Impact:
    - Model evasion: In classification scenarios, carefully designed adversarial inputs can lead the quantized model to misclassify inputs that a floating-point model would correctly classify. This can undermine the reliability of the model in security-sensitive applications like image recognition or fraud detection.
    - Incorrect predictions: Beyond classification, numerical instability can cause inaccurate or unreliable outputs in various machine learning applications. For instance, in a quantized regression model, adversarial inputs could lead to significantly skewed predictions, affecting the system's functionality.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project documentation highlights goals of "Excellent quantized int8 model quality" and "WYTIWYS (What you train is what you serve)." While aspirational, these are not direct code-level mitigations for adversarial robustness.
    - AQT incorporates "stochastic rounding" and various "calibration algorithms" (e.g., `MeanOfAbsMaxCalibration`, `WeightedStatsCalibration`, `DelayedScalingCalibration` in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_calibration.py` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/delayed_scaling_calibration.py`). These techniques aim to minimize accuracy loss during quantization but may not fully address robustness against targeted adversarial inputs exploiting numerical boundaries.
    - The library offers flexible quantization configurations (defined in `/code/aqt/common/aqt_config.py`) allowing users to tune quantization parameters. However, the documentation and code examples do not explicitly guide users on how to configure quantization for adversarial robustness.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Lack of explicit adversarial robustness testing as part of the development and validation process. The existing tests in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py` primarily focus on functional correctness, not adversarial robustness.
    - Absence of runtime adversarial input detection or mitigation techniques in deployed models.
    - No clear guidelines or warnings in the project documentation regarding potential numerical instability and accuracy degradation, especially concerning adversarial inputs. Users might be unaware of these risks when deploying AQT-quantized models in security-critical applications.
* Preconditions:
    - A machine learning model is deployed for inference, utilizing the AQT library for quantization of tensor operations.
    - An attacker possesses knowledge or can infer that the deployed model uses AQT and its quantization configurations (e.g., int8, int4, specific calibration methods). This information might be gleaned from public documentation, error messages, or by observing model behavior.
    - The attacker can send arbitrary inputs to the deployed model, for example, through a public API endpoint, and observe the model's output.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. The core quantization logic is found within the `/code/aqt/jax/v2` directory, with key files including:
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/aqt_quantizer.py`: Defines the quantization and dequantization operations.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/aqt_tensor.py`: Implements the `QTensor` class, representing quantized tensors and their associated scales.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/numerics/int_numerics.py`: Contains numerical implementations for integer quantization, including clipping and rounding.
    2. The Flax integration is primarily in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax`:
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax.py`: This is the central file, providing Flax modules like `AqtDotGeneral`, `AqtEinsum`, and `AqtConvGeneralDilated`. These modules are designed to be injected into Flax models, replacing standard operations with their quantized AQT counterparts. For example, `AqtDotGeneral` in `AqtEinsum` (as seen in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py`) handles the quantized dot product.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_dg_core.py`: Implements the core dot_general operation with Flax lifted custom_vjp, which is crucial for enabling gradient computation through quantized operations.
        - `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/freezer.py`: The `Freezer` module is used to "freeze" quantized weights and scales during model conversion for serving, as demonstrated in examples like `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples/flax_e2e_intercept_model_test.py` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model_test.py`. The `Freezer`'s `READ` mode is used during serving to load these frozen quantized values.
        - Calibration modules like `MeanOfAbsMaxCalibration` (in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_calibration.py`) and `DelayedScalingCalibration` (in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/delayed_scaling_calibration.py`) are used to determine appropriate quantization scales. These are integrated into the quantization process within `AqtDotGeneral` and related modules.
    3. Vulnerability Trigger: Numerical instability can be triggered in the quantization process, specifically within the clipping and rounding steps in files like `/code/aqt/jax/v2/numerics/int_numerics.py` and during the scaling and dequantization operations. Adversarial inputs are designed to maximize the impact of these numerical inaccuracies. For instance, inputs with values close to quantization boundaries might be rounded or clipped in ways that drastically alter the final output after dequantization and subsequent operations. The `aqt_matmul_int8` function example in `/code/README.md` illustrates clipping and scaling, which are potential points of exploitation.
    4. No Explicit Adversarial Handling:  A review of the code, especially in the mentioned files and the example models in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples` and `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples`, reveals no explicit checks or handling mechanisms for adversarial inputs or mitigation of numerical instability caused by such inputs. The focus is on functional correctness and general accuracy of quantized models, rather than adversarial robustness.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Choose an example ML model that utilizes AQT for quantization. The MNIST CNN model used in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/examples/flax_e2e_model_test.py` or the intercepted model in `/code/aqt/jax/v2/flax/intercept/examples/flax_e2e_intercept_model_test.py` can serve as a good starting point. Train and deploy this model using AQT quantization. Assume a publicly available inference endpoint for the deployed model.
    2. Establish a baseline: Select a normal input (e.g., a correctly classified MNIST image for the CNN model) and record the model's prediction (output logits or class probabilities) for both the floating-point (unquantized) and the AQT-quantized model.
    3. Craft adversarial inputs:
        - Start with the normal input.
        - Apply perturbation techniques to this input. Focus on perturbations that are likely to interact with quantization boundaries or amplify quantization errors. Strategies include:
            - Boundary attacks: Iteratively modify input features to values that are just above or below quantization boundaries (e.g., the clipping range or rounding thresholds used in AQT).
            - Sensitivity-based attacks: Perturb input features that have high sensitivity in the model, as these perturbations are more likely to cause significant output changes even with quantization. Gradient-based adversarial attack methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), adapted for quantized models, could be effective. Tools like Foolbox or ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox) can automate adversarial input generation.
        - Monitor the quantized model's output as the input is perturbed. Compare it to the floating-point model's output for the same perturbed input.
    4. Detect Output Discrepancy: Measure the difference between the quantized model's output and the floating-point model's output for the adversarial inputs. Significant deviations in output for small, semantically imperceptible input perturbations would indicate numerical instability exploited by the adversarial input.
    5. Quantify Success: Evaluate the success of the attack by:
        - Model evasion rate: For classification models, measure the percentage of adversarial inputs that cause misclassification in the quantized model compared to the floating-point model.
        - Output deviation magnitude: For regression or other tasks, quantify the average or maximum difference in output values between the quantized and floating-point models for adversarial inputs.
    6. Example Perturbation Steps (for CNN on MNIST):
        - Select an MNIST image correctly classified by both models.
        - Identify pixels with values close to quantization boundaries (e.g., if using int8 quantization with a range of [-128, 127], pixels with values near -128 or 127 after scaling to this range).
        - Iteratively increase or decrease the values of these pixels by small increments (e.g., 1/255 in pixel value space, corresponding to a smaller change in the quantized space after scaling).
        - After each perturbation step, feed the modified image to both the floating-point and quantized models and compare the outputs.
        - Continue perturbation until a significant output difference or misclassification occurs in the quantized model, while ensuring the perturbed image remains visually similar to the original image.
    7. Report Vulnerability: If successful in crafting adversarial inputs that reliably cause significant output discrepancies or model evasion in the AQT-quantized model, document the steps, perturbation techniques, and the magnitude of the observed vulnerability. This demonstrates the practical exploitability of numerical instability in AQT-quantized models.
