### 1. Vulnerability Name:
Improper Validation of `share_stats_axes` in `StatsConfig` leading to potential shape mismatches

### Description:
1. **Vulnerability:** The `StatsConfig.validate` method in `aqt_config.py` checks if `share_stats_axes` is valid for a given `data_shape`. However, it only performs a check `if not dynamic:`, implying that when `dynamic=True` (which is the default value in the function signature), the validation for unknown dimensions is skipped. This could lead to a scenario where, in dynamic quantization, the `share_stats_axes` does not actually contain all unknown axes, causing shape mismatches during runtime when AQT operations are performed.

2. **Step-by-step trigger:**
    - Define a model that uses AQT with dynamic quantization (i.e., `dynamic=True` is passed to `StatsConfig.validate` or left as default via `AqtScheduleConfig` or `DotGeneral` config).
    - Configure an AQT operation (e.g., via `AqtDotGeneral` or `AqtEinsum` in `aqt_flax.py`) to use a `StatsConfig` with dynamic quantization.
    - Within the `StatsConfig`, specify a `share_stats_axes` that does not include all dimensions which are `None` in the `data_shape`. This misconfiguration can happen when users manually create `StatsConfig` or when a higher-level configuration system incorrectly sets `share_stats_axes`.
    - Instantiate and run the model with input data that triggers the AQT operation. The shape of the input data should have `None` dimensions corresponding to the misconfigured `share_stats_axes` in `StatsConfig`.
    - When the AQT operation executes, it will attempt to use `share_stats_axes` for statistics sharing in dynamic dimensions. If `share_stats_axes` is incomplete, a shape mismatch error may occur during runtime, as the code expects all unknown dimensions to be handled by the specified axes.

### Impact:
- **Incorrect Model Behavior:** Shape mismatches can lead to runtime errors or incorrect computations during model execution, particularly when using dynamic shapes as intended in scenarios like variable sequence lengths in NLP models. This can result in unpredictable or incorrect model outputs, including NaN values if numerical instability is triggered by shape-related errors.
- **Model Training Instability:** If shape mismatches occur during training, especially in distributed training scenarios where shapes can vary across devices, it can disrupt the training process, potentially leading to training failures, hangs, or models that do not converge properly.
- **Subtle Model Manipulation (Low Probability, but theoretically possible):** While not a direct exploit for external attackers, in very specific, complex models with carefully crafted adversarial inputs and detailed knowledge of the AQT configuration and model architecture, an attacker *might* be able to leverage shape-related errors and the resulting unexpected quantization behavior in dynamic shapes to subtly manipulate model outputs. This is highly theoretical and requires deep internal knowledge, making it unlikely to be a primary attack vector for external threats. However, it highlights a potential weakness in the robustness of AQT under misconfiguration.

### Vulnerability Rank:
Medium

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- **Partial Validation:** The `StatsConfig.validate` method does perform validation when `dynamic=False`, but it explicitly skips validation for dynamic quantization scenarios, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.
- **Type Checking and Assertions:** AQT and JAX's type system and assertions in the code may catch some shape mismatches during development and testing. However, these are runtime checks and do not prevent the misconfiguration from being deployed.
- **Example Configurations and Tests:** The project includes example configurations (like `config_v4` in `aqt/jax/v2/config.py`) and tests (like in `aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py` and `aqt/jax/v2/flax/aqt_flax_test.py`) that are designed to work correctly. However, these do not prevent users from creating misconfigurations.

### Missing Mitigations:
- **Complete Validation for Dynamic Quantization:** The validation logic in `StatsConfig.validate` should be enhanced to fully validate `share_stats_axes` even when `dynamic=True`. This should involve checking if all `None` dimensions in `data_shape` are included in `share_stats_axes` and raise a `ConfigError` if not. This validation should be enforced regardless of the `dynamic` flag.
- **Security Test Case Improvement:** The existing security test case (`test_stats_config_dynamic_validation_vulnerability`) is a good start but should be expanded to not only check for `ConfigError` in validation but also to simulate a runtime scenario where a shape mismatch *could* occur if the validation was not present. While the current test confirms the missing validation, a more robust test would try to trigger the actual shape mismatch during a dummy AQT operation within the test, to better demonstrate the real-world impact of this vulnerability.
- **Clearer Documentation and Warnings:** Documentation should explicitly warn users about the importance of correctly configuring `share_stats_axes` in dynamic quantization scenarios and provide guidance on how to ensure correct configuration. Error messages from `ConfigError` should also be made more user-friendly and informative, guiding users to the correct configuration.

### Preconditions:
- The AQT project is used with dynamic quantization enabled (either explicitly set or by default configuration).
- A `StatsConfig` is created with `dynamic=True` (or defaults to `True`).
- The `share_stats_axes` in `StatsConfig` is misconfigured to not include all `None` dimensions from the `data_shape` provided during validation.
- The misconfigured `StatsConfig` is used in an AQT operation (e.g., `AqtDotGeneral`, `AqtEinsum`).
- Input data with dynamic shapes (dimensions as `None` in `data_shape` and actual dynamic sizes during runtime) is processed by the model, triggering the AQT operation.

### Source Code Analysis:
- **File:** `/code/aqt/common/aqt_config.py`
- **Function:** `StatsConfig.validate`

```python
  def validate(self, data_shape: List[Optional[int]],  # pytype: disable=signature-mismatch  # overriding-parameter-count-checks
               dynamic: bool = False):
    ...
    if not dynamic: # <--- Vulnerability: Validation skipped when dynamic=True
      unknown_axes = {i for i, dim in enumerate(data_shape) if dim is None}
      shared_axes = set(self.share_stats_axes)
      if not unknown_axes.issubset(shared_axes):
        raise ConfigError(f'expected share_stats_axes ({self.share_stats_axes})'
                          ' to contain unknown axes for given data shape '
                          f'({data_shape})')
    ...
```
- As highlighted in the code snippet, the vulnerability lies in the conditional validation. The `if not dynamic:` block means that the crucial check for ensuring `share_stats_axes` includes all unknown axes is bypassed when `dynamic` is set to `True`.
- In dynamic quantization, where shapes are not fully known at compile time (represented by `None` in `data_shape`), it is *equally* important, if not more so, to validate `share_stats_axes`. Skipping this validation in dynamic scenarios can lead to runtime shape mismatches and errors.
- The rest of the `StatsConfig.validate` method performs other checks that are still executed regardless of the `dynamic` flag, but the specific check related to unknown axes is omitted for dynamic quantization.
