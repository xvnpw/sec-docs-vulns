- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via GCS Bucket Path in auto_forensicate.py

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious GCS bucket path string.
  2. The attacker provides this malicious GCS bucket path as the destination argument when running the `auto_forensicate.py` script on a target machine booted with the GiftStick USB drive.
  3. The `auto_forensicate.py` script, without proper sanitization of the GCS bucket path, uses this input in a system command execution.
  4. Due to insufficient input validation, the attacker's malicious GCS bucket path injects arbitrary shell commands into the system command.
  5. When the script executes the command, the injected commands are executed on the target system with the privileges of the `auto_forensicate.py` script (likely root due to `sudo` usage in documentation).

- Impact:
  - **Critical:** Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with elevated privileges (root, if script is run with sudo as documented). This can lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the target machine.
    - Data exfiltration beyond the intended forensic evidence.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors.
    - Denial of service by crashing the system or deleting critical files.
    - Manipulation of forensic evidence collection process.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **None:** Based on the provided project files, there is no evidence of input sanitization or validation implemented for the GCS bucket path within the `auto_forensicate.py` script or related scripts. The documentation and code snippets suggest direct usage of the user-provided GCS path in command execution without any security considerations.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for the GCS bucket path in `auto_forensicate.py` to remove or escape any characters that could be used for command injection (e.g., semicolons, backticks, pipes, dollar signs, etc.).
  - **Input Validation:** Validate the GCS bucket path format to ensure it conforms to the expected structure (e.g., `gs://bucket-name/path/`). Reject any input that deviates from the expected format.
  - **Parameterization of Commands:**  If possible, use parameterized commands or functions that prevent shell injection by separating commands from arguments. For example, when using Python's `subprocess` module, use the list format for commands to avoid shell interpretation.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly mitigating command injection, running the `auto_forensicate.py` script with the minimum necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful injection. However, forensic operations often require elevated privileges.

- Preconditions:
  1. The attacker must be able to boot the target machine using a GiftStick USB drive created from the vulnerable GiftStick project.
  2. The attacker must have the ability to specify command-line arguments to the `auto_forensicate.py` script when it is executed on the target system. This is possible as per the usage instructions in `README.md`.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - Based on the provided `README.md` and `tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`, the `auto_forensicate.py` script is called with the GCS bucket path directly from the command line:
    ```bash
    sudo python auto_forensicate.py \
        --gs_keyfile=credentials.json \
        --logging stdout \
        --acquire all \
        gs://giftstick-bucket/forensics_evidence/
    ```
  - The `gs://giftstick-bucket/forensics_evidence/` part in the above command is directly taken as the destination.
  - In `tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`, the `GCS_REMOTE_URL` variable, which is derived from user inputs during the `remaster.sh` process, is passed as an argument to `auto_forensicate.py`:
    ```bash
    sudo "${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}" \
      ...
      ${EXTRA_OPTIONS} "${GCS_REMOTE_URL}/"
    ```
  - If `auto_forensicate.py` uses this `destination` argument (which corresponds to `GCS_REMOTE_URL` or user-provided GCS path) in a shell command without sanitization, a command injection vulnerability will exist.
  - **Visualization (Conceptual):**
    ```
    User Input (GCS Bucket Path) --> [No Sanitization] --> Command Construction in auto_forensicate.py --> System Command Execution --> Command Injection Vulnerability
    ```
  - **Note:** The actual `auto_forensicate.py` source code is needed to confirm the exact location and mechanism of command execution using the GCS bucket path. However, based on the project description and documentation, this is the most likely vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Prepare a test machine that can be booted from USB.
     - Build a GiftStick bootable USB drive using `tools/remaster.sh` with a valid Xubuntu 20.04 ISO, a test GCP project, and a test GCS bucket (you can use a bucket you control for testing, or a dummy name if you only want to verify local command execution). Follow the instructions in `README.md` to create the USB drive.
  2. **Boot Target Machine:**
     - Boot the test machine using the created GiftStick USB drive.
     - Wait for the Xubuntu environment to load.
     - Open a terminal window in the booted environment (e.g., using Ctrl+Alt+T).
  3. **Execute Vulnerable Script with Malicious Payload:**
     - Navigate to the `auto_forensicate` directory: `cd /home/xubuntu/GiftStick/auto_forensicate` (assuming GiftStick is cloned to the user's home directory as per `call_auto_forensicate.sh`).
     - Execute `auto_forensicate.py` with a malicious GCS bucket path designed to inject a command. For example, to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory, use the following command (replace `credentials.json` with the actual path to your service account key file if needed, or use a dummy path if only testing local execution):
       ```bash
       sudo python auto_forensicate.py --gs_keyfile=credentials.json --logging stdout --acquire all 'gs://test-bucket/path/; touch /tmp/pwned'
       ```
       **Note:** If you don't have a `credentials.json` file readily available for testing GCS upload, you can still test local command injection by providing a dummy path for `--gs_keyfile` (e.g., `--gs_keyfile=/tmp/dummy_key.json`). The command injection vulnerability is independent of the GCS upload functionality itself.
  4. **Verify Command Injection:**
     - After the `auto_forensicate.py` script finishes (or errors out due to the invalid GCS path), check if the injected command was executed. In this test case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created:
       ```bash
       ls /tmp/pwned
       ```
     - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful.
  5. **Expected Result:**
     - The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the target system, indicating successful command injection.
     - The `auto_forensicate.py` script might fail or produce errors during execution due to the malformed GCS path or lack of GCS credentials (if a dummy path was used for `--gs_keyfile`), but the key indicator is the execution of the injected command.
     - **Cleanup:** Remove the `/tmp/pwned` file after testing: `rm /tmp/pwned`.
