- **Vulnerability name:** Path Traversal in SentencePieceVocabulary file loading

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker can control the `sentencepiece_model_file` parameter when creating a `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` object.
  2. The `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` constructor or subsequent usage loads the SentencePiece model from the file path provided in `sentencepiece_model_file`.
  3. If the application using SeqIO allows users to specify or influence the `sentencepiece_model_file` path without proper validation, an attacker can provide a malicious path, such as `../../../../etc/passwd` or similar path traversal strings.
  4. When SeqIO attempts to load the vocabulary, it uses `tf.io.gfile.GFile` to open the file from the attacker-controlled path.
  5. This can lead to path traversal, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the file system where the SeqIO code is executed, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or application configuration files.

- **Impact:**
  High. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive data, configuration files, or source code.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
  None. The code directly uses the provided file path without any sanitization or validation against path traversal attacks.

- **Missing mitigations:**
  - Path sanitization: Implement input validation to sanitize and normalize the `sentencepiece_model_file` path to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
  - Path restriction: Restrict the allowed paths for vocabulary files to a specific directory or a whitelist of allowed files.
  - Input validation documentation: If user-provided paths are intended to be supported, provide clear documentation on the security implications and necessary sanitization steps that users must implement.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The application using SeqIO must allow user-controlled input to specify or influence the `sentencepiece_model_file` parameter when creating `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` objects.
  - The attacker needs to know or guess a valid path to a sensitive file on the server's filesystem.

- **Source code analysis:**
  1. File: `/code/seqio/vocabularies.py`
  2. Class: `SentencePieceVocabulary`
  3. Method: `__init__(self, sentencepiece_model_file: str, ...)`
  4. The constructor takes `sentencepiece_model_file` as an argument, which is a string representing the file path to the SentencePiece model.
  5. Method: `_model_context(self)`
  6. Inside `_model_context`, the code uses `tf.io.gfile.GFile(sentencepiece_model_file, "rb")` to open and read the model file.
  7. The `sentencepiece_model_file` variable, which is user-controlled, is directly passed to `tf.io.gfile.GFile` without any validation or sanitization.
  8. This direct file path usage allows path traversal if a malicious user provides a crafted path.

- **Security test case:**
  1. Setup:
     - Assume a SeqIO-based application that allows users to specify a task configuration through a web interface or API.
     - This configuration includes specifying vocabulary paths, which are then used to instantiate `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary`.
  2. Attacker action:
     - As an external attacker, craft a malicious task configuration where the `sentencepiece_model_file` parameter is set to a path traversal string, for example: `"../../../../etc/passwd"`.
     - Submit this malicious configuration to the application.
  3. Expected result:
     - If the application is vulnerable, SeqIO will attempt to load the SentencePiece model from the path `../../../../etc/passwd`.
     - Depending on file system permissions and application error handling, the application might:
       - Successfully read the `/etc/passwd` file and potentially expose its content in logs or error messages.
       - Throw an exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionDeniedError`) that indicates the application attempted to access the file, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.
  4. Step to prove vulnerability:
     - Check application logs or error messages for any indication of file access attempts outside the intended vocabulary directory, specifically for paths like `/etc/passwd` or similar sensitive system files.
     - If successful in reading the file (even if an error is thrown), this proves the path traversal vulnerability in `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` file loading.
