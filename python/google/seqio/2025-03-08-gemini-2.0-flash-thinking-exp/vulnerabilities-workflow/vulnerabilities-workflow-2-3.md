- Vulnerability Name: Improper Input Validation in Custom Preprocessors
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts malicious input data intended for a SeqIO pipeline.
    2. This data is processed by a SeqIO Task, which utilizes custom preprocessors defined by the user.
    3. If a custom preprocessor, especially one using `tf.py_function` for arbitrary Python code, lacks proper input validation, it may fail to handle the malicious input correctly.
    4. This improper handling can lead to unexpected behavior, such as exceptions, incorrect data processing, or potentially security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the custom preprocessor's code.
- Impact:
    - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the custom preprocessor. It could range from data corruption and pipeline failure to more severe security breaches if the preprocessor interacts with external systems or performs privileged operations. In the context of model training pipelines, malicious data could lead to corrupted or biased models.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The SeqIO library itself provides a framework for defining data pipelines and preprocessors, but it does not enforce specific input validation measures within custom preprocessors.
    - The documentation encourages users to use TensorFlow operations within preprocessors for better performance and AutoGraph conversion, but it does not mandate input validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation within custom preprocessors is missing.
    - There are no built-in mechanisms in SeqIO to enforce input validation or sanitization in user-defined preprocessors.
    - Best practices and guidelines for secure preprocessor development should be documented more explicitly, especially when using `tf.py_function`.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must define and use a custom preprocessor within a SeqIO Task.
    - The custom preprocessor must process external input data without proper validation.
    - The attacker must be able to provide malicious input data to the SeqIO pipeline.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `README.md` file describes Preprocessors as functions that transform `tf.data.Dataset`. It highlights the flexibility of using TensorFlow operations and `tf.py_function` for arbitrary Python code within preprocessors.
    - The `README.md` explicitly mentions: "Note: `tf.data` pipelines using this function can only be run in the python process where they were defined, and performance is limited by the python GIL." This note is about performance and execution context but indirectly hints at the potential risks when using arbitrary Python code, especially if security is not considered.
    - The provided code examples in `README.md`, like the `translate` preprocessor, are relatively simple and do not demonstrate input validation.
    - The file `seqio/preprocessors.py` provides several built-in preprocessors, but they do not inherently include input validation mechanisms against malicious inputs.
    - The general architecture of SeqIO, as described in the documentation, relies on user-defined preprocessors for data transformation, making input validation the responsibility of the user.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a SeqIO Task that includes a vulnerable custom preprocessor. This preprocessor will use `tf.py_function` to execute Python code that is susceptible to malicious input (e.g., a preprocessor that attempts to execute shell commands based on input text - for demonstration purposes only, do not implement this in real-world scenarios). For example, a vulnerable preprocessor might take an input string and use it in `os.system()` without sanitization.
    2. **Craft Malicious Input:** Create a malicious input string designed to exploit the vulnerability in the custom preprocessor (e.g., an input string containing shell commands to be injected).
    3. **Execute Pipeline:** Run the SeqIO pipeline with the malicious input data through `seqio.get_dataset`.
    4. **Observe Behavior:** Observe the behavior of the pipeline. A successful exploit would manifest as the execution of the injected commands, observable through system logs or side effects. In a less severe case, it might trigger an exception or data corruption due to improper input handling.
    5. **Expected Result (Successful Exploit):** The malicious commands injected in step 2 are executed by the vulnerable preprocessor. This would demonstrate the vulnerability of improper input validation in custom preprocessors when using `tf.py_function`.
    6. **Expected Result (Mitigation):** If mitigations were in place (e.g., input validation in the custom preprocessor), the malicious input would be sanitized or rejected, preventing the execution of injected commands and demonstrating that the vulnerability is mitigated.
