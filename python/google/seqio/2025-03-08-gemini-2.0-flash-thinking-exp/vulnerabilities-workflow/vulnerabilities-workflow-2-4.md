- vulnerability name: Unsafe Python Code Execution in Custom Preprocessors via `tf.py_function`
- description: |
  The SeqIO library allows users to define custom preprocessing functions for their tasks. When using `tf.py_function` within these custom preprocessors, arbitrary Python code can be executed as part of the TensorFlow data pipeline. This introduces a vulnerability if a SeqIO task processes datasets that include data from untrusted sources. An attacker could craft malicious input data that, when processed by a SeqIO task using a vulnerable custom preprocessor with `tf.py_function`, executes arbitrary Python code on the system.

  Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this vulnerability can be triggered:
  1. A user defines a SeqIO `Task` that includes a custom preprocessor function.
  2. Within this custom preprocessor function, the user utilizes `tf.py_function` to perform some data transformation or operation.
  3. An attacker crafts malicious input data specifically designed to exploit a vulnerability in the Python code within the `tf.py_function`. This could involve input that causes the Python code to execute unintended actions, such as reading sensitive files, executing system commands, or otherwise compromising the system.
  4. The SeqIO pipeline processes the malicious input data through the custom preprocessor, which executes the attacker-controlled Python code within `tf.py_function`.
  5. The malicious Python code is executed in the Python environment where the SeqIO pipeline is running, potentially leading to security breaches.
- impact: |
  The impact of this vulnerability is **critical**. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the machine running the SeqIO pipeline. This could lead to:
  * **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could read sensitive data accessible to the Python process.
  * **System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the Python process, an attacker could potentially gain control over the system, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
  * **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker could use the compromised process to perform actions that are normally restricted, such as modifying data or accessing internal resources.
- vulnerability rank: critical
- currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided code to prevent execution of arbitrary code via `tf.py_function` in custom preprocessors. The documentation includes a note about `tf.py_function` usage, but it's more of a performance/deployment limitation warning than a security mitigation.
- missing mitigations: |
  Several mitigations are missing to address this vulnerability:
  * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom preprocessors to ensure that input data cannot be used to inject malicious code or trigger unsafe operations within `tf.py_function`.
  * **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment of `tf.py_function` to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution. However, `tf.py_function` is inherently designed to execute arbitrary Python code, making sandboxing complex.
  * **Discouraging `tf.py_function` Usage:** Discourage the use of `tf.py_function` in user-defined preprocessors, especially when dealing with untrusted data sources. Provide secure and performant TensorFlow-native alternatives for common preprocessing operations.
  * **Security Audits and Reviews:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of custom preprocessors, particularly those that utilize `tf.py_function`, to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities.
  * **Documentation and Best Practices:** Clearly document the security risks associated with using `tf.py_function` in custom preprocessors and provide best practices for secure dataset processing, emphasizing input validation and avoiding execution of untrusted code.
- preconditions: |
  To trigger this vulnerability, the following preconditions must be met:
  * A SeqIO `Task` must be defined that includes a custom preprocessor function.
  * This custom preprocessor function must utilize `tf.py_function` to execute Python code.
  * The SeqIO `Task` must be configured to process a dataset that can be influenced by an attacker (e.g., data from external sources, user uploads, etc.).
  * The attacker must be able to craft malicious input data that can exploit the Python code within the `tf.py_function`.
- source code analysis: |
  The vulnerability stems from the design of `tf.py_function` and SeqIO's preprocessor mechanism, rather than a specific code flaw in the provided files.

  1. **`README.md`**: Highlights the `tf.py_function` and notes its ability to wrap arbitrary Python code:
  ```markdown
  *   [`tf.py_function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/py_function)
      allows you to wrap arbitrary Python code. Note: `tf.data` pipelines
      using this function can only be run in the python process where they
      were defined, and performance is limited by the python GIL.
  ```
  This documentation implicitly acknowledges the capability of `tf.py_function` to execute arbitrary Python code within the data pipeline.

  2. **`/code/seqio/preprocessors.py`**: Demonstrates the usage of preprocessors, including the potential use of `tf.py_function` (though not explicitly shown in the provided preprocessors, the documentation encourages it for "arbitrary Python code").

  3. **Overall Architecture**: SeqIO's architecture allows users to define custom `Task`s with flexible preprocessing pipelines. When users leverage the flexibility of `tf.py_function` to incorporate custom Python logic, they inherit the inherent risks of executing arbitrary code, especially when processing external or untrusted data.

  The source code itself doesn't contain specific code to exploit. The vulnerability arises from the combination of SeqIO's design allowing custom preprocessors and TensorFlow's `tf.py_function` enabling arbitrary Python code execution within these preprocessors.

- security test case: |
  **Title:** Verify Unsafe Code Execution via Malicious Input in Custom Preprocessor

  **Description:** This test case demonstrates how an attacker can execute arbitrary Python code by crafting malicious input data that is processed by a SeqIO task with a vulnerable custom preprocessor using `tf.py_function`.

  **Preconditions:**
  1. A SeqIO Task named `vulnerable_task` is registered.
  2. `vulnerable_task` uses a custom preprocessor function named `unsafe_preprocessor`.
  3. `unsafe_preprocessor` utilizes `tf.py_function` to process input data.
  4. The `unsafe_preprocessor` is designed to be vulnerable to code injection through crafted input.

  **Vulnerable Code Snippet (within `unsafe_preprocessor` in `vulnerable_task`):**
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  import subprocess

  def unsafe_preprocessor(dataset):
    @seqio.map_over_dataset
    def _unsafe_map_fn(ex):
      user_input = ex['malicious_input'].numpy().decode('utf-8')
      # Vulnerable code: Directly executing user input as a shell command
      subprocess.run(user_input, shell=True, check=False)
      return ex
    return _unsafe_map_fn(dataset)
  ```

  **Test Steps:**
  1. **Register the `vulnerable_task`:**
  ```python
  import seqio
  import functools
  import tensorflow as tf

  def unsafe_preprocessor(dataset):
    @seqio.map_over_dataset
    def _unsafe_map_fn(ex):
      user_input = ex['malicious_input'].numpy().decode('utf-8')
      # Vulnerable code: Directly executing user input as a shell command
      import subprocess
      subprocess.run(user_input, shell=True, check=False)
      return ex
    return _unsafe_map_fn(dataset)


  TASK_NAME = "vulnerable_task"
  if TASK_NAME in seqio.TaskRegistry.names():
      seqio.TaskRegistry.remove(TASK_NAME)

  seqio.TaskRegistry.add(
      TASK_NAME,
      source=seqio.FunctionDataSource(
          dataset_fn=lambda split, shuffle_files, seed=None: tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors({
              'malicious_input': tf.constant(" Harmless Input"),
          }),
          splits=["train"],
      ),
      preprocessors=[unsafe_preprocessor],
      output_features={},
      metric_fns=[],
  )
  ```
  2. **Craft Malicious Input Data:** Create input data that contains a malicious shell command. For example, to list files in the `/tmp` directory:
  ```python
  malicious_input = 'ls /tmp' # or 'cat /etc/passwd' for more sensitive info if permissions allow
  raw_data = {'train': {'malicious_input': malicious_input.encode('utf-8')}}
  ```
  3. **Run the SeqIO pipeline with the malicious input:**
  ```python
  task_name = "vulnerable_task"
  try:
    test_preprocessing_single(task_name, raw_data)
  except Exception as e:
    if "ls: /tmp: No such file or directory" in str(e):
        print("Vulnerability likely NOT exploitable in test environment due to file system restrictions, but code execution is still possible.")
    else:
        raise
  ```

  **Expected Result:**
  - The test should execute without crashing the SeqIO pipeline itself.
  - Evidence of code execution should be observable. In this example, the output of `ls /tmp` (or attempt to access `/etc/passwd`) would be observable in the logs or console output of the Python process running the SeqIO pipeline if successful.
  - If the environment prevents the shell command from running (e.g., due to permissions), the test might raise an exception from `subprocess.run`, but the key is that SeqIO attempts to execute the code.

  **Cleanup:**
  - Ensure to remove the registered `vulnerable_task` after the test to avoid polluting the environment for other tests.
  ```python
  if TASK_NAME in seqio.TaskRegistry.names():
      seqio.TaskRegistry.remove(TASK_NAME)
  ```

  **Note:** This test case is a simplified example. Real-world exploits could involve more sophisticated malicious code and target more critical system functions. This test serves to demonstrate the **possibility** of arbitrary code execution, not necessarily a fully functional exploit for a specific real-world vulnerability. It's crucial to understand that the primary vulnerability is the *pattern* of using `tf.py_function` unsafely, rather than this specific test case itself.
