- Vulnerability Name: Malicious SentencePiece Vocabulary File Injection

- Description:
An attacker can craft a malicious SentencePiece vocabulary file and provide it to a user intending to define a SeqIO Task. If the user incorporates this malicious vocabulary file into their Task definition, any subsequent use of this Task will employ the attacker-supplied vocabulary. This can lead to mis-tokenization of data during preprocessing.
Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
1. An attacker creates a malicious SentencePiece vocabulary file. This file could be crafted to mis-tokenize specific inputs in a way that benefits the attacker or introduces biases.
2. The attacker distributes this malicious vocabulary file, possibly through social engineering or by hosting it on a seemingly legitimate website or repository.
3. A victim, intending to define a SeqIO Task, is tricked into using the malicious vocabulary file path in their Task definition, specifically within the `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` constructor for `output_features`.
4. The victim then uses this Task for data processing, model training, or evaluation. SeqIO will load and utilize the malicious vocabulary from the attacker-specified file path.

- Impact:
The primary impact is the mis-tokenization of input data. This can have several downstream consequences:
1. Misleading Model Training: Models trained using data tokenized with a malicious vocabulary may learn incorrect representations and exhibit unexpected or biased behavior.
2. Exploitable Vulnerabilities: Mis-tokenization could create pathways to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream models or systems relying on those models. For example, it might be possible to craft inputs that bypass security filters or trigger unintended model behavior.
3. Data Bias Introduction: A malicious vocabulary could introduce subtle or significant biases into the dataset, leading to models that perpetuate or amplify these biases.
4. Evaluation Metric Skew: Evaluation metrics calculated on mis-tokenized data may not accurately reflect the true performance of a model.
5. Data Integrity Compromise: The integrity of the processed data is compromised, as the tokenization process, a fundamental step in NLP pipelines, is under the attacker's control.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The project does not implement specific mitigations against malicious vocabulary files. The code relies on the user to provide a trustworthy vocabulary file path. There is no input validation or security check on the vocabulary file itself within the `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` class or the Task definition process.

- Missing Mitigations:
1. Vocabulary File Validation: Implement checks to validate the integrity and safety of vocabulary files before they are loaded and used. This could include:
    - Checksums or digital signatures to verify the authenticity of vocabulary files.
    - Static analysis of vocabulary files to detect potentially malicious patterns or unusual token mappings.
    - Sandboxing or isolated environments for vocabulary loading and processing to limit the impact of malicious files.
2. Documentation and User Guidance: Clearly document the risks associated with using untrusted vocabulary files and provide best practices for vocabulary management, such as:
    - Recommending vocabulary files from trusted sources.
    - Advising users to verify the source and integrity of vocabulary files.
    - Warning against using vocabulary files from unknown or untrusted origins.

- Preconditions:
1. The attacker must create and distribute a malicious SentencePiece vocabulary file.
2. The victim must be a user who is defining a SeqIO Task and is incorporating a SentencePiece vocabulary.
3. The victim must be tricked or persuaded into using the attacker's malicious vocabulary file path instead of a legitimate one.

- Source Code Analysis:
The vulnerability lies within the `seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary` class, specifically in how it loads and uses vocabulary files provided as file paths.

```python
# File: /code/seqio/vocabularies.py
class SentencePieceVocabulary(Vocabulary):
  ...
  def __init__(
      self,
      sentencepiece_model_file: str, # <--- vulnerable parameter: file path from user
      extra_ids: int = 0,
      normalizer_spec_overrides: Optional[
          sentencepiece_model_pb2.NormalizerSpec
      ] = None,
      reverse_extra_ids: bool = True,
      use_fast_tokenizer: bool = False,
  ):
  ...
    self._sentencepiece_model_file = sentencepiece_model_file # <--- file path is stored
    ...

  def _model_context(
      self,
  ) -> _ModelContext:
    """Loads model if not yet loaded and returns the model context."""
    if self._model:
      return self._model

    normalizer_spec_overrides_serialized = (
        self._normalizer_spec_overrides.SerializeToString(deterministic=True)
        if self._normalizer_spec_overrides
        else None
    )

    self._model = _load_model( # <--- malicious file path is used here to load the vocabulary
        self._sentencepiece_model_file, # <--- user-provided file path
        self._extra_ids,
        normalizer_spec_overrides_serialized,
        self._reverse_extra_ids,
    )
    return self._model
```

The `SentencePieceVocabulary` class constructor takes `sentencepiece_model_file: str` as an argument. This argument, intended to be a path to a SentencePiece model file, is directly used to load the vocabulary using `_load_model` function.

```python
# File: /code/seqio/vocabularies.py
def _load_model(
    sentencepiece_model_file: str, # <--- malicious file path is used here
    extra_ids: int,
    normalizer_spec_overrides_serialized: Optional[bytes] = None,
    reverse_extra_ids: bool = True,
) -> _ModelContext:
  with _load_model_lock:
    return _load_model_internal(
        sentencepiece_model_file, # <--- user-provided file path is used here
        extra_ids,
        normalizer_spec_overrides_serialized,
        reverse_extra_ids,
    )
```

The `_load_model` function then uses this file path directly to load the SentencePiece model without any validation or security checks. If an attacker can control the content of the file at `sentencepiece_model_file`, they can inject a malicious vocabulary.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    - Create a malicious SentencePiece vocabulary file (`malicious_vocab.model`) that maps the word "good" to token ID 100 and the word "bad" to token ID 200. For all other words, use a standard SentencePiece model behavior.
    - Host this malicious vocabulary file on a public URL or make it easily accessible to the attacker.
2. **Attacker Action:**
    - The attacker shares a SeqIO Task definition with the victim, or instructs the victim to create a Task definition, that uses the malicious vocabulary file from the attacker's controlled location. For example, the attacker provides the following Python code snippet to the victim:

```python
import seqio
import functools

seqio.TaskRegistry.add(
    "my_vulnerable_task",
    source=seqio.TfdsDataSource(tfds_name="wmt_t2t_translate/de-en:1.0.0"),
    preprocessors=[
        functools.partial(
            seqio.preprocessors.translate, source_language='en', target_language='de'),
        seqio.preprocessors.tokenize,
        seqio.preprocessors.append_eos
    ],
    output_features={
        'inputs':
            seqio.Feature(
                seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary('url/to/malicious_vocab.model'), # <--- Malicious vocab URL
                add_eos=False,
                dtype=tf.int32),
        'targets':
            seqio.Feature(
                seqio.SentencePieceVocabulary('/path/to/targets/vocab'), # Victim's target vocab
                add_eos=True,
                dtype=tf.int32),
    },
    metric_fns=[seqio.metrics.bleu]
)
```
3. **Victim Action:**
    - The victim, believing the Task definition is legitimate or unaware of the security implications, executes the provided Python code, registering the Task with the malicious vocabulary.
    - The victim then proceeds to use the "my_vulnerable_task" for data processing, training, or evaluation.
4. **Verification:**
    - Run the SeqIO Task "my_vulnerable_task" and process some input data containing the word "good".
    - Examine the tokenized output for the "inputs" feature.
    - If the vulnerability is triggered, the word "good" will be tokenized to token ID 100 (as defined in the malicious vocabulary), instead of the expected token ID from a legitimate vocabulary.
    - Similarly, check the tokenization of "bad" which should be token ID 200.
    - Observe the mis-tokenization and the potential impact on downstream tasks like model training or evaluation.
    - For example, print the tokenization of input "This is good and bad." and check if "good" and "bad" are tokenized to 100 and 200 respectively.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can inject a malicious vocabulary and cause mis-tokenization, confirming the vulnerability.
