### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious User Defined Function (UDF) Execution

- Description:
  1. A user creates a Space dataset and defines a materialized view with a data transformation pipeline.
  2. In the transformation pipeline, the user utilizes a User Defined Function (UDF) to process data batches.
  3. An attacker crafts a malicious UDF that performs unintended actions, such as accessing sensitive data, executing system commands, or introducing backdoors.
  4. The user, unknowingly or intentionally, uses the malicious UDF in their data transformation pipeline.
  5. When the data transformation pipeline is executed (e.g., during materialized view refresh or view read using Ray runner), the malicious UDF is executed within the environment where Space is running.
  6. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload in the UDF.

- Impact:
  - Critical: Arbitrary code execution within the environment where Space is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, data corruption, and unauthorized access to resources.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None evident from the provided project files. The README.md describes the UDF feature but does not mention any security considerations or mitigations for malicious UDFs.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization for UDF code: The project should implement mechanisms to validate and sanitize UDF code before execution. This could include static analysis, sandboxing, or code review processes.
  - Access control and authorization for UDF execution: Implement access controls to restrict who can define and execute UDFs. Consider role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
  - Sandboxing or containerization for UDF execution: Execute UDFs in isolated environments (sandboxes or containers) to limit the impact of malicious code. This can restrict access to sensitive resources and system functionalities.
  - Code signing and verification for UDFs: Implement code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of UDFs. Verify signatures before execution to prevent tampering.
  - Monitoring and logging of UDF execution: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track UDF execution, detect anomalies, and facilitate incident response in case of malicious activity.
  - Documentation and security guidelines for UDF usage: Provide clear documentation and security guidelines to users about the risks associated with UDFs and best practices for secure UDF development and deployment.

- Preconditions:
  - The user must utilize the UDF feature of Space to define data transformation pipelines.
  - An attacker must be able to provide or convince a user to use a malicious UDF in their pipeline. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising user accounts.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided project files do not contain the source code for UDF execution. Based on the README.md, UDFs are used in `map_batches` for data transformation pipelines and are executed using Ray.
  - Analyzing `/code/python/tests/core/test_views.py` and `/code/python/tests/core/test_runners.py` shows examples of using `map_batches` with UDFs, but these are test cases and do not include security checks.
  - The README.md mentions integration with Ray transform: `Reading or refreshing views must be the Ray runner, because they are implemented based on Ray transform`. This suggests that UDF execution is likely handled by Ray's distributed processing framework. Vulnerabilities might arise from how Space integrates with Ray and how UDFs are passed to and executed within Ray.
  - Further investigation of the `space/core/views.py`, `space/ray/runners.py`, and potentially Ray integration code would be needed to pinpoint the exact code paths involved in UDF execution and identify specific code-level vulnerabilities.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Deploy a Space instance (locally or in a test environment).
     - Create a Space dataset with a simple schema (e.g., `id: int64, data: binary`).
  2. **Craft Malicious UDF:**
     - Create a Python function that represents a malicious UDF. This function could be designed to:
       - Attempt to read environment variables.
       - Attempt to access files outside the designated Space storage area.
       - Execute system commands (e.g., using `os.system` or `subprocess`).
       - Introduce a delay or consume excessive resources (though DoS is excluded from this analysis, resource consumption leading to system instability is a valid impact of code execution).
     - Example malicious UDF (for demonstration - **do not use in production**):
       ```python
       import os
       import subprocess

       def malicious_udf(batch):
           # Attempt to read environment variables
           env_vars = os.environ
           print(f"Environment Variables: {env_vars}")

           # Attempt to execute system command (example - listing directory)
           try:
               subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Command execution failed: {e}")

           # Dummy transformation (to avoid breaking the pipeline completely)
           batch["data"] = [d + b" - processed by malicious UDF" for d in batch["data"]]
           return batch
       ```
  3. **Define Materialized View with Malicious UDF:**
     - Using the Space Python API, define a materialized view on the created dataset.
     - In the `map_batches` transform of the materialized view, specify the `malicious_udf` as the transformation function.
  4. **Trigger UDF Execution:**
     - Refresh the materialized view using the Ray runner: `mv_runner.refresh()`.
     - Alternatively, read the view using Ray runner: `view_runner.read_all()`.
  5. **Observe and Verify Impact:**
     - Monitor the environment where Space and Ray are running.
     - Check logs and outputs for evidence of malicious UDF execution:
       - Environment variables being printed.
       - Output from system commands (if execution was successful).
       - Any unexpected file access or network activity.
     - Verify that the dummy transformation part of the UDF is also executed (e.g., " - processed by malicious UDF" is appended to data) to confirm the UDF was indeed invoked.
  6. **Expected Result:**
     - Successful execution of the test case will demonstrate that arbitrary code, embedded within a UDF, can be executed by the Space system, confirming the "Malicious UDF Execution" vulnerability.
