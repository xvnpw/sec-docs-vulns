## Combined Vulnerability List

### Unsafe Deserialization of User Defined Functions (UDFs)

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python UDF that, when deserialized and executed, performs arbitrary code execution on the server or within the Ray cluster. This malicious UDF can perform unintended actions, such as accessing sensitive data, executing system commands, or introducing backdoors.
  2. The attacker injects this malicious UDF into a data transformation pipeline, for example, by creating a materialized view with a transform that uses the malicious UDF. This could be achieved by convincing a user to use a malicious UDF in their pipeline or by compromising user accounts.
  3. When the Space system attempts to materialize or refresh the view, or when a user reads the view using Ray runner, it deserializes the UDF using `cloudpickle`.
  4. Due to the inherent risks of `cloudpickle`, deserializing the malicious UDF triggers arbitrary code execution within the environment where Space is running, potentially compromising the Space environment and the underlying system.

- Impact:
  - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the data processing system. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized access to resources, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system takeover, depending on the privileges of the process executing the UDF.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None: The code uses `cloudpickle.load()` to deserialize UDFs without any apparent sandboxing, security checks, or input validation on the serialized UDF data. No evident mitigations are implemented within the project files, and the documentation lacks security considerations for UDFs.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Secure UDF deserialization: Implement a secure mechanism for deserializing UDFs. Consider sandboxing the execution environment, using secure serialization formats, or validating the UDF code before deserialization. Explore alternatives to `cloudpickle` if secure deserialization is paramount.
  - UDF validation: Implement input validation and sanitization for UDF code. Implement validation and sanitization of UDFs before they are stored or executed. This could include static analysis, code review, or restricting the capabilities of UDFs.
  - Access control and authorization for UDF execution: Implement access controls to restrict who can define and execute UDFs. Consider role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
  - Sandboxing or containerization for UDF execution: Execute UDFs in isolated environments (sandboxes or containers) to limit the impact of malicious code. This can restrict access to sensitive resources and system functionalities.
  - Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the processes executing UDFs have the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
  - Monitoring and logging of UDF execution: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track UDF execution, detect anomalies, and facilitate incident response in case of malicious activity.
  - Documentation and security guidelines for UDF usage: Provide clear documentation and security guidelines to users about the risks associated with UDFs and best practices for secure UDF development and deployment.
  - Code signing and verification for UDFs: Implement code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of UDFs. Verify signatures before execution to prevent tampering.

- Preconditions:
  1. The attacker needs to be able to define or modify a data transformation pipeline that includes a UDF. In the current project context, this likely means the attacker needs to be able to create or modify Materialized Views, which are user-defined.
  2. An attacker must be able to provide or convince a user to use a malicious UDF in their pipeline. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising user accounts.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **UDF Materialization and Loading:** In `/code/python/src/space/core/views.py`, the `MaterializedView.create` method serializes and saves UDFs using `cloudpickle`:
     ```python
     for name, udf in udfs.items():
       full_path = path.join(udf_dir, f"{name}.pkl")
       udf.dump(full_path) # UDF serialization happens here
       logical_plan.udfs[name] = path.relpath(full_path, location)
     ```
     The `UserDefinedFn.dump` method internally uses `cloudpickle.dump()`:
     ```python
     def dump(self, file_path: str) -> None:
       """Dump UDF into a file."""
       with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
         cloudpickle.dump(self, f) # Serialization with cloudpickle
     ```
  2. **UDF Deserialization during View Loading:**  The `UserDefinedFn.load` method in `/code/python/src/space/core/transform/plans.py` deserializes UDFs using `cloudpickle.load()`:
     ```python
     @classmethod
     def load(cls, file_path: str) -> UserDefinedFn:
       """Load a UDF from a file."""
       with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
         udf = cloudpickle.load(f) # Deserialization with cloudpickle
       return udf
     ```
     This `load` method is called by `_load_udf` in `/code/python/src/space/core/transform/udfs.py`, which is then used to reconstruct transforms and views when loading a materialized view from storage in `load_materialized_view` and `MaterializedView.load` in `/code/python/src/space/core/views.py`.
  3. **Vulnerable Deserialization:**  `cloudpickle.load()` is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the data being deserialized is maliciously crafted. The Space project uses `cloudpickle` to serialize and deserialize UDFs without any apparent sanitization or sandboxing. This makes the system vulnerable to code injection attacks via malicious UDFs.
  4. The README.md mentions integration with Ray transform: `Reading or refreshing views must be the Ray runner, because they are implemented based on Ray transform`. This suggests that UDF execution is likely handled by Ray's distributed processing framework. Vulnerabilities might arise from how Space integrates with Ray and how UDFs are passed to and executed within Ray.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Deploy a Space instance (locally or in a test environment). Assume an attacker has access to a Space instance where they can create materialized views.
     - Create a Space dataset with a simple schema (e.g., `id: int64, data: binary`).
     - The attacker needs to prepare a malicious Python script (`malicious_udf.py`) that contains a UDF designed to execute arbitrary code. For example, the UDF could execute a system command to create a file in the `/tmp` directory as a proof of concept.
       ```python
       # malicious_udf.py
       import numpy as np
       import subprocess

       class MaliciousUDF:
         def __call__(self, batch):
           subprocess.run(["touch", "/tmp/space_pwned"]) # Malicious command execution
           batch["float64"] = batch["float64"] + 1
           return batch

       def get_malicious_udf():
         return MaliciousUDF()
       ```
  2. **Vulnerability Injection:**
     - In a notebook/script, define a `_sample_map_udf` function that imports and uses the `get_malicious_udf` from `malicious_udf.py`.
       ```python
       import pyarrow as pa
       from space import Dataset, DirCatalog, RayOptions
       from malicious_udf import get_malicious_udf # Import malicious UDF

       def _sample_map_udf(batch):
         malicious_udf = get_malicious_udf()
         return malicious_udf(batch) # Calling malicious UDF

       # Setup dataset and catalog (as in provided examples)
       catalog = DirCatalog("/tmp/space_cat")
       schema = pa.schema([("f", pa.int64()), ("float64", pa.float64())])
       ds = catalog.create_dataset("test_ds", schema, ["f"], [])

       # Create a view with the malicious UDF
       view = ds.map_batches(
           fn=_sample_map_udf,
           output_schema=schema,
           output_record_fields=[],
           input_fields=["f", "float64"]
       )

       # Materialize the view - this will serialize and store the malicious UDF
       mv = catalog.materialize("test_mv", view)
       ```
  3. **Trigger Vulnerability (Deserialization):**
     - In a separate step or script, load the materialized view. This action triggers the deserialization of the stored UDF, including the malicious payload.
       ```python
       from space import DirCatalog

       catalog = DirCatalog("/tmp/space_cat")
       mv_loaded = catalog.dataset("test_mv") # Loading dataset will trigger UDF deserialization
       print("Materialized view loaded (malicious UDF should be executed during loading)")
       ```
     - Alternatively, refresh the materialized view using the Ray runner: `mv_runner.refresh()`.
     - Or read the view using Ray runner: `view_runner.read_all()`.
  4. **Verification:**
     - After running the script in step 3, check if the file `/tmp/space_pwned` exists on the system where the deserialization occurred (likely the Ray head node or the local machine if running locally). The existence of this file indicates successful arbitrary code execution.
     - Monitor the environment where Space and Ray are running. Check logs and outputs for evidence of malicious UDF execution and any unexpected system behavior.

### Potential Deserialization Vulnerability via PyArrow in Dataset Loading

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious ML dataset, embedding malicious payloads within dataset files (e.g., Parquet, ArrayRecord) that are processed by pyarrow.
    2. A user loads this maliciously crafted dataset using Space's `Dataset.load()` or `catalog.dataset()` functions.
    3. Space utilizes pyarrow for reading and processing Parquet and potentially other data formats.
    4. If pyarrow is vulnerable to deserialization issues when handling specific data formats or metadata, processing the malicious dataset could trigger these vulnerabilities.
    5. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when Space attempts to load and process the dataset.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary code execution on the machine of a user loading a malicious dataset. Potential for data exfiltration, system compromise, or further attacks depending on the permissions of the user running Space.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly implemented within the Space project code to directly mitigate pyarrow deserialization vulnerabilities. The project relies on the security of underlying libraries.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of dataset files before processing them with pyarrow. This could involve:
        - Schema validation to ensure datasets conform to expected structures.
        - Scanning dataset files for suspicious or malicious content before loading.
        - Running pyarrow in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    - Dependency management and security updates:
        - Regularly updating pyarrow and other dependencies to the latest versions that include security patches.
        - Monitoring security advisories related to pyarrow and its dependencies.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ML dataset to a Space user. This could be achieved through:
        - Hosting the malicious dataset on a publicly accessible storage location (e.g., cloud bucket, website) and tricking users into loading it.
        - Compromising a data source that Space users ingest data from.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not contain specific code snippets that directly perform deserialization and are vulnerable. However, the vulnerability arises from the project's dependency on `pyarrow` for dataset handling.
    - `File: /code/README.md` and `/code/python/README.md` highlight the use of Arrow in the API surface and mentions Parquet and ArrayRecord file formats.
    - `File: /code/docs/design.md` details the data files supported, including Parquet and ArrayRecord, and mentions metadata design using Parquet.
    - `File: /code/python/pyproject.toml` lists `pyarrow >= 14.0.0` as a dependency.
    - `File: /code/src/space/__init__.py` and other python code files show the structure of the Space library, indicating components for datasets, catalogs, storage, and runners, which would interact with data loading functionalities and potentially pyarrow.
    - The vulnerability is not within Space's code itself, but in how it uses `pyarrow` to process external data. The risk exists when `Dataset.load()` or catalog loading mechanisms are used with untrusted datasets.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Step 1: Create a malicious Parquet dataset.** This dataset should be crafted to exploit a known or hypothetical deserialization vulnerability in pyarrow.  Tools and techniques for crafting such payloads would need to be researched based on known pyarrow vulnerabilities or general deserialization attack vectors (if any exist). For example, if pyarrow's Parquet reader had a vulnerability related to specific metadata fields, craft a Parquet file with those malicious metadata.
    2. **Step 2: Host the malicious Parquet dataset** at a publicly accessible URL, or make it available through a local path that the test environment can access.
    3. **Step 3: Write a Python script to simulate a Space user loading this malicious dataset.** This script will:
        ```python
        from space import Dataset

        dataset_location = "/path/to/malicious/dataset" # or a public URL if accessible

        try:
            ds = Dataset.load(dataset_location) # or using catalog.dataset()
            # Attempt to read or process the dataset to trigger deserialization
            data = ds.local().read_all()
            print(data)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during dataset loading: {e}")
        ```
        Replace `/path/to/malicious/dataset` with the actual path or URL of the malicious dataset.
    4. **Step 4: Run the Python script** in a controlled test environment where the Space library is installed.
    5. **Step 5: Monitor the execution environment** for signs of arbitrary code execution, such as:
        - Unexpected system calls.
        - Unauthorized file access.
        - Network connections to external locations initiated by the Python process.
        - Crashes or unexpected behavior in the Python process indicative of an exploit attempt.
    6. **Step 6: If arbitrary code execution is confirmed**, the vulnerability is validated. If the script throws an error but no code execution is observed, further investigation into the specific error and potential exploitation vectors is needed. If the script runs without issues and no malicious activity is observed, the test case did not trigger the vulnerability, but further test cases with different payloads or pyarrow versions might be needed.
