## Vulnerabilities Found

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Interactive Viewer

#### XSS via Malicious Game Log or Session ID/Player Input
* Description:
    1. A malicious actor crafts a specially designed game log file, a malicious `session_id`, a malicious player name or injects malicious JavaScript code into their debate message.
    2. This malicious payload is designed to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when a user opens the interactive viewer.
    3. The user opens the interactive viewer in their browser and provides the malicious `session_id` in the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<malicious_session_id>`). Alternatively, the malicious content is already present in a previously generated game log.
    4. The viewer loads the game log file associated with the provided `session_id`.
    5. If the game log file or the processing of the `session_id` or player input contains unsanitized user-controlled data (player names, debate messages, etc.) that is reflected in the viewer's web page, the malicious JavaScript code is injected into the page.
    6. The injected JavaScript code executes in the user's browser when the page is rendered.
* Impact:
    - Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking: Attacker can steal the user's session cookies and gain unauthorized access to the application.
    - Data theft: Attacker can steal sensitive information displayed or accessible within the viewer.
    - Defacement: Attacker can modify the content of the viewer page.
    - Redirection: Attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website.
    - Account takeover if the viewer is authenticated.
    - Further attacks against the victim's system.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent in the provided Python backend code or described in the README for the viewer. The provided code is for the game logic, not the viewer itself. Based on the provided files, there is no evidence of input or output sanitization implemented in the game engine or explicitly mentioned for the interactive viewer. We must assume no mitigation exists in the viewer based on the provided backend context and common web application vulnerabilities.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize all user-provided inputs, including player names, debate messages, votes and the `session_id` and data from the game log files, before logging or displaying them.
    - Output encoding: Encode all user-provided data from game logs before rendering it in HTML in the viewer to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code. This can be achieved by HTML encoding HTML special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) or using a secure templating engine that automatically escapes output by default.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP in the interactive viewer to control the sources from which the viewer can load resources and restrict inline JavaScript execution.

* Preconditions:
    - The interactive viewer must be vulnerable to XSS due to lack of output sanitization.
    - A malicious actor needs to be able to create or manipulate a game log file, craft a malicious `session_id`, or influence game log data through player input during game play (e.g., malicious player name or debate message).
    - A victim user needs to open the interactive viewer with the malicious `session_id` or load a malicious game log.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability likely resides in the JavaScript code of the interactive viewer, specifically in the part that handles rendering game logs or processing the `session_id`.
    - If the viewer directly embeds data from the game log (which could be influenced by player input or `session_id`) into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, it becomes vulnerable.
    - **Backend Code Analysis:**
        - **`code/model.py`**: The `Player` class stores player's `name` and `GameView` stores `debate`. These are stored as strings and are serialized to JSON without sanitization.
        - **`code/logging.py`**: The `save_game` function serializes the `State` object (including `Player` and `GameView` data) into a JSON file.
    - **Data Flow**:
        ```
        [Player Name Input/Debate Message/Session ID] --> [Game Engine (Python)] --> [Game Log (JSON File)] --> [Interactive Viewer (Frontend - assumed Javascript)] --> [Browser (Victim)]
                                                                                                            ^
        Malicious JavaScript Injection Point (Player Name/Debate Message/Session ID) -----------------------|
        XSS Vulnerability if Viewer doesn't sanitize data from Game Log before rendering in Browser.
        ```
    - **Absence of Sanitization**: There is no code in the provided Python backend files that implements sanitization or encoding of player names or debate messages before they are logged. Assuming the viewer directly renders data from these logs without sanitization is a reasonable assumption based on common web application vulnerability patterns.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Payload**: Choose one of the following methods to inject malicious JavaScript:
        a. **Malicious Player Name:** Modify `code/werewolf/config.py` and replace a default name in `NAMES` list with `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS_PlayerName")>`.
        b. **Malicious Debate Message:** Participate in a game and include `<script>alert('XSS in debate')</script>` in your dialogue.
        c. **Malicious Game Log File (Directly Modify):** After running a game and generating logs, manually edit a game log JSON file. Find a player name or debate message and replace it with `<script>alert("XSS_LogFile")</script>`.
    2. **Run the Game (if using player name or debate message injection):** Run the game as described in `README.md`. Note the `session_id`.
    3. **Launch Interactive Viewer**: Launch the interactive viewer as described in `README.md` (typically using `npm i` and `npm run start`). Access it at `http://localhost:8080`.
    4. **Access Game Log in Viewer**: Open the viewer in a browser using the `session_id` from step 2 (or the `session_id` of the modified log file if directly modified): `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<session_id>`.
    5. **Verify XSS**:
        - If using malicious player name: Check if an alert box with "XSS_PlayerName" pops up.
        - If using malicious debate message: Check if an alert box with "XSS in debate" pops up when the debate message is rendered in the viewer.
        - If using modified log file: Check if an alert box with "XSS_LogFile" pops up.
    6. **Expected Result**: If an alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.

#### Potential XSS via LLM Generated Content in Game Logs
* Description:
    1. The Python backend generates game logs in JSON format, which include content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during game sessions. This content includes player debates, summaries, and reasoning.
    2. This game log data is intended to be displayed by a separate Node.js-based interactive viewer.
    3. If the Node.js viewer directly renders the LLM-generated text from the game logs without proper sanitization, and if an attacker can influence the LLM to generate malicious JavaScript code within its responses, this malicious code could be embedded in the game logs.
    4. When a user opens the game log in the interactive viewer, the viewer might execute the embedded malicious JavaScript code, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    5. An attacker could potentially influence LLM responses by manipulating game state or prompts.

* Impact:
    - If exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user viewing a compromised game log.
    - This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
        - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        - Defacing the viewer page.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the viewer application.

* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident in the provided Python backend code. The code focuses on game logic and data generation, not on sanitizing output for a web viewer.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Sanitization in the Node.js Viewer:** The primary missing mitigation is robust output sanitization in the Node.js viewer. All LLM-generated text retrieved from game logs and displayed in the viewer should be properly sanitized to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) in the Node.js Viewer:** Implementing a Content Security Policy in the Node.js viewer can further mitigate XSS risks.

* Preconditions:
    1. A vulnerable Node.js interactive viewer exists and is used to display game logs generated by this Python backend.
    2. The Node.js viewer does not properly sanitize LLM-generated content before rendering it in the browser.
    3. An attacker has a way to influence the LLM to generate responses containing malicious JavaScript code that gets logged into the game session data.
    4. A user views a game log containing the malicious JavaScript code in their browser using the vulnerable interactive viewer.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`werewolf/logging.py`:** Saves game state and logs to JSON files.
    2. **`werewolf/model.py`:** Defines game classes, `RoundLog` and `State` objects contain LLM generated text fields.
    3. **`werewolf/lm.py`:** `generate` function calls LLM APIs, raw responses and parsed results are stored in `LmLog` objects, which are saved in logs.
    4. **`werewolf/apis.py`:** Interface to LLM APIs, retrieves raw text responses.
    5. **`werewolf/game.py` and `werewolf/runner.py`:** Game logic and LLM interactions. LLM responses are incorporated into game state and logs without sanitization.

                                                                                                  [Node.js Interactive Viewer (Vulnerable if no sanitization)] --> [User Browser (XSS Execution)]
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Run a game using the Python backend to generate a game log.
    2. **Modify LLM Response (Simulate Attack):** Manually edit a game log file (e.g., `game_logs.json`). Find a section with LLM-generated text and replace it with malicious JavaScript code, e.g., `{"reasoning": "...", "say": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>"}`.
    3. **Open in Viewer:** Open the modified game log in the Node.js interactive viewer.
    4. **Verify XSS:** Check if the JavaScript code injected in step 2 is executed. You should see an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability!".
    5. **Expected Result:** Alert box confirms the potential XSS vulnerability.
