### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Interactive Viewer via Game Logs

* Description:
    1. A malicious actor participates in a Werewolf game hosted by the application.
    2. During the game, the attacker crafts a player name, in-game dialogue, or other input to include malicious JavaScript code.
    3. The backend Python application logs the game events, including the attacker's malicious input, into a JSON game log file.
    4. Another user (victim) opens the interactive viewer application and loads the game log file containing the attacker's malicious JavaScript code.
    5. The interactive viewer, if not properly sanitizing the game log data before displaying it in the user's browser, executes the embedded JavaScript code within the victim's browser session.

* Impact:
    * Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    * Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, displaying misleading content, or further attacks against the victim's system.
    * Compromise of the victim's user account if the viewer application interacts with any backend services.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None in the provided backend Python code. The backend code is responsible for generating and logging the game data, but it does not include any sanitization or encoding of data that would prevent XSS in a frontend viewer.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input sanitization on the backend: Sanitize or encode player inputs (names, dialogues, votes) before logging them to prevent injection of malicious scripts into the game logs.
    * Output sanitization in the interactive viewer: The interactive viewer application (code not provided) needs to sanitize or escape all game log data before rendering it in the HTML context to prevent execution of any embedded JavaScript code. This is the primary missing mitigation.
    * Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy for the interactive viewer to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline JavaScript execution, which can reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

* Preconditions:
    1. An attacker must be able to participate in a Werewolf game and provide input that is logged.
    2. A victim user must access the interactive viewer and load a game log that contains the attacker's malicious input.
    3. The interactive viewer application must be vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient output sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    * **File: `/code/werewolf/logging.py`**: This file contains functions to save the game state and logs into JSON files (`save_game`).
    * **File: `/code/werewolf/game.py` & `/code/werewolf/model.py`**: These files handle game logic and player interactions. Player inputs and LLM generated text are collected and stored in game state objects (`State`, `Round`, `Player`, `LmLog`).
    * **No sanitization**: The provided Python code does not perform any sanitization or encoding of player inputs or LLM outputs before logging them. For example, player names, dialogues in `Player.debate()`, or vote choices are directly stored in the game logs.
    * **Data Flow**:
        1. Player input (e.g., during debate in `Player.debate()`) is captured as a string.
        2. This string is stored in `GameView.debate` in `model.py`.
        3. The `GameView` and other game state information are serialized to JSON using `JsonEncoder` in `model.py`.
        4. The JSON data is written to log files using `json.dump` in `logging.py`.
        5. If the interactive viewer (code not provided) directly reads and displays this JSON data without sanitization, any malicious JavaScript injected by a player into their input will be executed in the viewer.

    ```
    [Player Input (Malicious JavaScript)] --> [Game Logic in game.py & model.py] --> [Game State & Logs in model.py] --> [JSON Encoding in model.py & logging.py] --> [Game Log Files in logging.py] --> [Interactive Viewer (Frontend - Code Not Provided) - Potential XSS if no sanitization]
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Run the Werewolf game backend as described in `README.md`. Assume an interactive viewer is set up according to the instructions in `README.md` as well.
    2. **Malicious Player Participation:** As an attacker, join a running game. When prompted for a name, use a malicious name like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.  Participate in the debate and include `<script>alert('XSS in debate')</script>` in your dialogue. Vote for a player using a name like `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS in vote')">VictimPlayer</a>`.
    3. **Game Completion and Log Generation:** Let the game complete and ensure that the game logs are saved in the `logs` directory as JSON files.
    4. **Victim Viewer Access:** As a victim user, open the interactive viewer in a web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<session_id_of_malicious_game>`).
    5. **Verify XSS:** Check if the JavaScript code injected by the attacker is executed in the victim's browser when the game log is loaded and displayed in the viewer. You should see alert boxes pop up ('XSS', 'XSS in debate', 'XSS in vote') if the XSS vulnerability is present.
    6. **Expected Result:** If the interactive viewer is vulnerable, the alert boxes should appear, demonstrating that unsanitized game log data can lead to JavaScript execution in the victim's browser. If the viewer is properly sanitized, no alert boxes should appear, and the malicious code should be displayed as plain text.
