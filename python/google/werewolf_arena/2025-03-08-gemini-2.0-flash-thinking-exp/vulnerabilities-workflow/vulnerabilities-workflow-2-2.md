### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Interactive Viewer
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious player name or injects malicious JavaScript code into their debate message.
    2. The game engine processes this input, and it gets logged into the game log file (JSON format).
    3. The interactive viewer application reads this game log file to display game information.
    4. The viewer renders the player names and debate messages from the log on the web page without proper sanitization of user-controlled data.
    5. If the malicious JavaScript code from the player name or debate message is rendered in the HTML context of the viewer, it will be executed by the victim's browser, leading to XSS.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a game log using the interactive viewer.
    - This can lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to: session hijacking (stealing session cookies), account takeover if the viewer is authenticated, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the viewer page, or further attacks against the victim's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided backend Python code. Based on the provided files, there is no evidence of input or output sanitization implemented in the game engine or explicitly mentioned for the interactive viewer. We must assume no mitigation exists in the viewer based on the provided backend context and common web application vulnerabilities.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Sanitization in Interactive Viewer:** The primary missing mitigation is output sanitization in the interactive viewer. When the viewer reads and displays game log data (specifically player names, debate messages, and potentially any other user-controlled data rendered in the viewer), it must sanitize this data before rendering it in the HTML page. This can be achieved by:
        - **HTML Encoding:** Encoding HTML special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) in the displayed content. This ensures that any HTML tags or JavaScript code injected by an attacker are treated as plain text and not executed by the browser.
        - **Using a Secure Templating Engine:** Employing a templating engine that automatically escapes output by default, reducing the risk of developers accidentally introducing XSS vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to influence the game log data. This can be achieved by:
        - Participating in a game and setting a malicious player name.
        - Participating in a game and crafting a malicious debate message.
        - If game logs can be manipulated externally and loaded into the viewer, that would be another precondition, although less likely in a typical usage scenario of this project based on provided files.
    - A victim (another user or administrator) needs to open the interactive viewer in their web browser and load a game log that contains the attacker's malicious input. This is typically done by accessing the viewer URL with a specific `session_id` parameter, as described in the `README.md`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`code/model.py`**:
        - The `Player` class stores player's `name` as a string. This name is set during game initialization in `runner.py` and could potentially be influenced to contain malicious content if player name generation is not controlled.
        - The `GameView` class stores `debate` as a list of tuples `(author: str, dialogue: str)`. The `update_debate` function appends dialogue messages to this list. These dialogue messages are generated by the LLMs based on prompts, but the prompts themselves include game state information, including player names and previous messages, creating a potential path for malicious content to be logged.
        - The `to_dict` methods in `model.py` and related classes recursively convert game state objects into dictionaries, which are then serialized to JSON. This process preserves the player names and debate messages in the game log.
    - **`code/logging.py`**:
        - The `save_game` function serializes the `State` object (which includes `Player` and `GameView` data containing names and debates) into a JSON file.
        - The `load_game` function reads these JSON files and deserializes them back into `State` objects.
    - **`code/README.md`**:
        - Provides instructions to launch the interactive viewer using `npm i` and `npm run start`.
        - Explains how to access the viewer in a browser using a URL like `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=session_20240610_084702`. This confirms that the viewer likely reads game logs based on the `session_id` from the URL parameter.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        [Player Name Input/Debate Message] --> [Game Engine (Python)] --> [Game Log (JSON File)] --> [Interactive Viewer (Frontend - assumed Javascript)] --> [Browser (Victim)]
                                                                                                            ^
        Malicious JavaScript Injection Point (Player Name/Debate Message) ------------------------------------|
        XSS Vulnerability if Viewer doesn't sanitize data from Game Log before rendering in Browser.
        ```
    - **Absence of Sanitization**: There is no code in the provided Python backend files (`model.py`, `logging.py`, `game.py`, `runner.py`, `prompts.py`, `utils.py`, `config.py`, `apis.py`, `lm.py`) that implements sanitization or encoding of player names or debate messages before they are logged. We are missing the viewer code, but assuming it directly renders data from these logs without sanitization is a reasonable assumption based on common web application vulnerability patterns and the project description pointing towards XSS in the viewer.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup**: Follow the instructions in `code/README.md` to set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
    2. **Modify Player Names (Malicious Payload Injection)**:
        - Edit the file `code/werewolf/config.py`.
        - Locate the `NAMES` list.
        - Replace one of the default names with a malicious payload designed to trigger an XSS vulnerability. For example:
          ```python
          NAMES = [
              "Derek", "Scott", "Jacob", "Isaac", '<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS_PlayerName")>', "David", "Tyler",
              "Ginger", "Jackson", "Mason", "Dan", "Bert", "Will", "Sam",
              "Paul", "Leah", "Harold"
          ]
          ```
          This payload `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS_PlayerName")>` will attempt to load an image from a non-existent source (`src=x`). When the image fails to load (onerror event), it will execute the JavaScript code `alert("XSS_PlayerName")`, which will display an alert box in the browser if XSS is successful.
    3. **Run the Game**:
        - Open a terminal, activate the virtual environment (`source ./venv/bin/activate`), and navigate to the `/code` directory.
        - Execute the game: `python3 main.py --run`
        - Note the `session_id` that is part of the log directory name created in the `logs` folder (e.g., `logs/session_20240720_123456`).
    4. **Launch Interactive Viewer**:
        - In a new terminal, navigate to the directory containing the viewer (assuming it's in the project root, based on `README.md` instructions like `npm i` and `npm run start` which are typically run in the frontend directory). If the viewer code is not provided in PROJECT FILES, assume a standard setup where viewer files are in a directory accessible from project root.
        - Install viewer dependencies: `npm i`
        - Start the viewer: `npm run start`
        - The viewer should typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
    5. **Access Game Log in Viewer**:
        - Open a web browser and go to the viewer URL, appending the `session_id` from step 3 as a query parameter: `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<session_id>`. Replace `<session_id>` with the actual session ID of the game you ran.
    6. **Verify XSS**:
        - Check if an alert box with the message "XSS_PlayerName" pops up in the browser.
        - If the alert box appears, it confirms that the malicious JavaScript code injected through the player name was successfully executed in the context of the viewer, demonstrating a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
