### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Game Log or Session ID
* Description:
    1. A malicious actor crafts a specially designed game log file or a `session_id`.
    2. This malicious payload is designed to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when a user opens the interactive viewer.
    3. The user opens the interactive viewer in their browser and provides the malicious `session_id` in the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<malicious_session_id>`).
    4. The viewer loads the game log file associated with the provided `session_id`.
    5. If the game log file or the processing of the `session_id` contains unsanitized user-controlled data that is reflected in the viewer's web page, the malicious JavaScript code is injected into the page.
    6. The injected JavaScript code executes in the user's browser when the page is rendered.
* Impact:
    - Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking: Attacker can steal the user's session cookies and gain unauthorized access to the application.
    - Data theft: Attacker can steal sensitive information displayed or accessible within the viewer.
    - Defacement: Attacker can modify the content of the viewer page.
    - Redirection: Attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent in the provided Python backend code or described in the README for the viewer. The provided code is for the game logic, not the viewer itself.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize all user-provided inputs, including the `session_id` and data from the game log files, before displaying them in the viewer.
    - Output encoding: Encode all user-provided data before rendering it in HTML to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP to control the sources from which the viewer can load resources and restrict inline JavaScript execution.
* Preconditions:
    - The interactive viewer must be vulnerable to XSS. This is assumed based on the prompt.
    - A malicious actor needs to be able to create or manipulate a game log file or craft a malicious `session_id`.
    - A victim user needs to open the interactive viewer with the malicious `session_id` or load a malicious game log.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - Since the viewer's code is not provided, the source code analysis is hypothetical and based on the general understanding of XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.
    - The vulnerability would likely reside in the JavaScript code of the interactive viewer, specifically in the part that handles rendering game logs or processing the `session_id`.
    - If the viewer directly embeds data from the game log (which could be influenced by the `session_id` and potentially attacker-controlled) into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, it becomes vulnerable.
    - For example, if player names, debate dialogues, or any other data from the game log are displayed without encoding, and a malicious actor can inject JavaScript code into these fields within a crafted game log or via a crafted `session_id` which influences the log content, then XSS is possible.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious game log file or craft a malicious `session_id`. For example, if player names are displayed in the viewer, create a game log where a player name is set to `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    2. Save this malicious game log file.
    3. Launch the interactive viewer.
    4. In the browser, open the viewer with the malicious `session_id` that points to the malicious game log file. For example, modify the command from README: `http://localhost:8080/?session_id=<malicious_session_id_pointing_to_malicious_log>`.
    5. Observe if an alert box with "XSS" is displayed.
    6. If the alert box is displayed, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.
    7. For a more realistic attack, replace `alert("XSS")` with JavaScript code that steals cookies or redirects to a malicious site.
    8. Verify that the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser.
