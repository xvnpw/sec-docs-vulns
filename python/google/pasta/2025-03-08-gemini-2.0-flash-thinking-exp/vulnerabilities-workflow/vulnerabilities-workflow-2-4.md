### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **AST Injection via Maliciously Crafted Code during Rename Augmentation**
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python code snippet.
    2. This code snippet is parsed into an AST using `pasta.parse`.
    3. The attacker uses `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` function to rename a specific module or name within the AST, intending to refactor the code.
    4. Due to insufficient validation or sanitization during the AST manipulation in `rename_external`, the attacker's malicious code, embedded within the original code or introduced during the rename operation, is injected into the AST.
    5. When the modified AST is converted back to source code using `pasta.dump`, the injected malicious code becomes part of the output source code.
    6. If this refactored code is executed, the attacker's malicious code will be executed as well.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Arbitrary code injection. An attacker can inject malicious Python code into the refactored codebase. If the refactored code is executed, this can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, system compromise, or unauthorized access.
- Vulnerability Rank: **High**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code files. The code focuses on functionality rather than security validation of AST transformations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**:  `pasta.parse` should validate the input source code to reject potentially malicious code structures before AST is created.
    - **AST Transformation Validation**: `rename_external` and other augmentation functions should include checks to ensure that AST modifications are safe and do not introduce new vulnerabilities. Specifically, validate that the renaming logic does not inadvertently create new code execution paths or modify existing ones in a harmful way beyond the intended refactoring.
    - **Output Sanitization/Verification**: Before dumping the AST back to source code, `pasta.dump` could include a step to verify the integrity and safety of the generated code, although this is less practical for AST manipulation libraries.
- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must be able to provide untrusted Python code as input to `pasta.parse`.
    2. The attacker must be able to control the parameters of the `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` function, specifically `old_name` and `new_name`.
    3. The user must execute the refactored code generated by `pasta.dump`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Entry Point (`pasta/__init__.py`):**
        ```python
        def parse(src):
          t = ast_utils.parse(src)
          annotator = annotate.AstAnnotator(src)
          annotator.visit(t)
          return t

        def dump(tree):
          return codegen.to_str(tree)
        ```
        - `pasta.parse` uses `ast_utils.parse` which internally uses `ast.parse` to parse the source code. No input validation is performed here.
        - `pasta.dump` uses `codegen.to_str` to generate code from AST. No output sanitization is performed here.
    - **Rename Augmentation (`pasta/augment/rename.py`):**
        ```python
        def rename_external(t, old_name, new_name):
          # ...
          for ref in sc.external_references[old_name]:
            if isinstance(ref.node, ast.alias):
              parent = sc.parent(ref.node)
              # ...
              else:
                ref.node.name = new_name + ref.node.name[len(old_name):] # potential issue - direct string manipulation
                if not ref.node.asname:
                  renames[old_name] = new_name
              has_changed = True
            elif isinstance(ref.node, ast.ImportFrom):
              if ref.node not in already_changed:
                assert _rename_name_in_importfrom(sc, ref.node, old_name, new_name)
                renames[old_name.rsplit('.', 1)[-1]] = new_name.rsplit('.', 1)[-1]
                already_changed.append(ref.node)
                has_changed = True

          for rename_old, rename_new in six.iteritems(renames):
            _rename_reads(sc, t, rename_old, rename_new) # potential issue - replace_child with parsed code
          return has_changed

        def _rename_reads(sc, t, old_name, new_name):
          # ...
          for ref_node in name.reads:
            if isinstance(ref_node, (ast.Name, ast.Attribute)):
              ast_utils.replace_child(sc.parent(ref_node), ref_node,
                                      ast.parse(new_name).body[0].value) # Injects new AST from string
              has_changed = True
            elif isinstance(ref_node, ast.Str) and ref_node.s.startswith(old_name):
              ref_node.s = ref_node.s.replace(old_name, new_name, 1) # direct string manipulation
          return has_changed
        ```
        - The `rename_external` function manipulates the AST to rename external references.
        - In `_rename_reads`, the code uses `ast.parse(new_name).body[0].value` to create a new AST node from the `new_name` string and replaces existing nodes using `ast_utils.replace_child`. If `new_name` is maliciously crafted, this could inject arbitrary AST nodes.
        - String manipulation on `ref_node.s = ref_node.s.replace(old_name, new_name, 1)` in `_rename_reads` when `ref_node` is `ast.Str` could also introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
    - **AST Utilities (`pasta/base/ast_utils.py`):**
        - `ast_utils.replace_child` replaces nodes in the AST, which is used by `_rename_reads` to inject new AST nodes.
        - No validation is performed in `replace_child` regarding the safety of the replacement.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Assume an attacker has access to a system where `pasta` library is used for refactoring Python code. The attacker can influence the input Python code and the rename parameters.
    2. **Craft Malicious Code:** The attacker crafts a Python code snippet containing a seemingly normal import statement and a call to a function from that module. However, the "new name" for renaming is chosen to be a malicious code snippet.
        ```python
        malicious_code = """
        import os
        import subprocess

        def normal_function():
            print("This is a normal function.")

        normal_function()
        """

        rename_from = "os"
        rename_to = "__import__('subprocess').run(['touch', '/tmp/pwned'], check=True)" # Malicious code injection

        ```
    3. **Parse and Rename:** Use `pasta.parse` to parse the `malicious_code` and then use `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` to rename 'os' to the malicious code.
        ```python
        import pasta
        from pasta.augment import rename

        tree = pasta.parse(malicious_code)
        rename.rename_external(tree, rename_from, rename_to)
        refactored_code = pasta.dump(tree)
        print(refactored_code)
        ```
    4. **Execute Refactored Code:** Execute the `refactored_code`.
        ```python
        exec(refactored_code)
        ```
    5. **Verify Impact:** Check if the malicious command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed. In this case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it exists, the code injection was successful.
