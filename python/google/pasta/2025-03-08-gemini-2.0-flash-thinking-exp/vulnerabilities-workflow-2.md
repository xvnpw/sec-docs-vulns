### AST Injection via Maliciously Crafted Code during Rename Augmentation

* **Vulnerability Name:** AST Injection via Maliciously Crafted Code during Rename Augmentation

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python code snippet.
    2. This code snippet is parsed into an AST using `pasta.parse`.
    3. The attacker uses `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` function to rename a specific module or name within the AST, intending to refactor the code.
    4. Due to insufficient validation or sanitization during the AST manipulation in `rename_external`, the attacker's malicious code, embedded within the original code or introduced during the rename operation as `new_name` parameter, is injected into the AST.
    5. Specifically, the `new_name` parameter of `rename_external` is parsed into an AST and directly embedded into the original AST using `ast_utils.replace_child`.
    6. When the modified AST is converted back to source code using `pasta.dump`, the injected malicious code becomes part of the output source code.
    7. If this refactored code is executed, the attacker's malicious code will be executed as well.

* **Impact:**
    Successful code injection can lead to severe consequences:
    - Logic flaws in the refactored code, altering the intended program behavior.
    - Introduction of security vulnerabilities, allowing for unauthorized access or data manipulation if the refactored code is part of a larger system.
    - In extreme cases, arbitrary code execution within the environment where the refactored code is run, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or unauthorized access.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Based on the provided project files, there are no explicit input validation or sanitization mechanisms implemented within the `rename_external` function or related AST manipulation logic to prevent this type of code injection. The code focuses on AST transformations and formatting preservation, but lacks security considerations regarding malicious input strings.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**:  `pasta.parse` could validate the input source code, but the primary issue is lack of sanitization in `rename_external`. The `rename_external` function should validate the `new_name` parameter to ensure it's a valid and safe name and does not contain executable code or unexpected syntax.
    - **AST Transformation Validation**: `rename_external` and other augmentation functions should include checks to ensure that AST modifications are safe and do not introduce new vulnerabilities. Specifically, validate that the renaming logic does not inadvertently create new code execution paths or modify existing ones in a harmful way beyond the intended refactoring.  Avoid directly embedding string inputs into the AST structure without proper escaping or encoding.
    - **Secure AST Manipulation Practices**: Implement secure AST manipulation practices to avoid directly embedding string inputs into the AST structure without proper escaping or encoding.

* **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must be able to provide untrusted Python code as input to `pasta.parse`.
    2. The attacker must be able to control the parameters of the `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` function, specifically the `new_name` argument.
    3. The user must execute the refactored code generated by `pasta.dump`.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `pasta/augment/rename.py`, Function: `rename_external(t, old_name, new_name)`**:
        - The function `rename_external` takes `old_name` and `new_name` as string arguments and directly uses them to manipulate AST nodes, specifically in `_rename_reads`.
        - In `_rename_reads`, the `new_name` is parsed into an AST using `ast.parse(new_name)` and then its value (`ast.parse(new_name).body[0].value`) is used to replace nodes in the original AST using `ast_utils.replace_child`. This parsing of `new_name` is the crucial point where code injection can occur. If `new_name` is crafted to be not just a name but a more complex expression, `ast.parse` will happily parse it, and `replace_child` will insert this potentially malicious AST into the code.
    2. **File: `pasta/augment/rename.py`, Function: `_rename_reads(sc, t, old_name, new_name)`**:
        ```python
        def _rename_reads(sc, t, old_name, new_name):
          # ...
          for ref_node in name.reads:
            if isinstance(ref_node, (ast.Name, ast.Attribute)):
              ast_utils.replace_child(sc.parent(ref_node), ref_node,
                                      ast.parse(new_name).body[0].value) # Injects new AST from string
              has_changed = True
            # ...
          return has_changed
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the line `ast_utils.replace_child(sc.parent(ref_node), ref_node, ast.parse(new_name).body[0].value)`.
        - `ast.parse(new_name)` parses the `new_name` string into an AST.
        - `.body[0].value` extracts the first expression from the parsed AST.
        - This expression is then used to replace the original node `ref_node` in the AST using `ast_utils.replace_child`.
        - There is no sanitization or validation of `new_name` before parsing and insertion, allowing for injection of arbitrary Python code.
    3. **Absence of Sanitization:**
        - There is no code in `rename_external` or related functions that validates or sanitizes `new_name` to ensure it's just a valid identifier or a safe name. The `new_name` is treated as a string to be parsed into Python code and directly inserted into the AST.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Assume an attacker has access to a system where `pasta` library is used for refactoring Python code. The attacker can influence the input Python code and the rename parameters.
    2. **Craft Malicious Code:** The attacker crafts a Python code snippet containing a seemingly normal import statement and a call to a function from that module. The "new name" for renaming is chosen to be a malicious code snippet that will execute system commands.
        ```python
        malicious_code = """
        import os

        def normal_function():
            print("This is a normal function.")

        normal_function()
        """

        rename_from = "os"
        rename_to = "__import__('subprocess').run(['touch', '/tmp/pwned'], check=True)" # Malicious code injection
        ```
    3. **Execution:** Use `pasta.parse` to parse the `malicious_code` and then use `pasta.augment.rename.rename_external` to rename 'os' to the malicious code. Then, execute the refactored code.
        ```python
        import pasta
        from pasta.augment import rename

        tree = pasta.parse(malicious_code)
        rename.rename_external(tree, rename_from, rename_to)
        refactored_code = pasta.dump(tree)

        # Save the modified code to a file (e.g., 'refactored_module.py')
        with open('refactored_module.py', 'w') as f:
            f.write(refactored_code)

        # Execute Refactored Code
        import refactored_module
        ```
    4. **Verify Impact:** Check if the malicious command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed. In this case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists in the `/tmp/` directory. If it exists, the code injection was successful. Additionally, examine the content of `refactored_module.py` to confirm that the malicious code replaced the original import statement.
