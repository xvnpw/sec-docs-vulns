### Vulnerabilities

- Vulnerability Name: Markdown Parsing Vulnerability in `markdown-toc` hook
- Description:
    - A malicious actor could craft a Markdown file that exploits a potential vulnerability in the `commonmark` library, which is used by the `markdown-toc` hook to parse Markdown content.
    - When a developer runs `pre-commit` on a repository containing this malicious Markdown file, the `markdown-toc` hook will process the file.
    - If the `commonmark` library is vulnerable, parsing the malicious Markdown file could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's local machine. This is because the `markdown-toc` hook is executed locally during the pre-commit stage.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's local machine. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project relies on the security of the `commonmark` library. There is no input sanitization or vulnerability mitigation implemented within the `markdown-toc` hook itself to address potential `commonmark` vulnerabilities.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies, including `commonmark`, for known vulnerabilities and update to patched versions. While the project doesn't directly manage `commonmark` version, it can document the dependency and recommend users to ensure they are using a secure environment with updated libraries.
    - Consider using a sandboxed environment or more secure markdown parsing approach if feasible, although this might be complex and impact functionality. For pre-commit hooks, the primary mitigation is to be aware of the risk and keep dependencies updated in the development environment.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have configured the `pre-commit-tool-hooks` in their `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and included the `markdown-toc` hook in their pre-commit checks.
    - The user must run `pre-commit` on a Git repository that contains a maliciously crafted Markdown file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `pre_commit_hooks/markdown_toc.py`:
        - The `_update_toc` function reads the content of Markdown files specified in `paths`.
        - It calls `markdown_links.get_links(contents)` to parse the Markdown content and extract headers.
    - `pre_commit_hooks/markdown_links.py`:
        - The `get_links` function utilizes the `commonmark` library to parse Markdown content using `md_parser = commonmark.Parser()` and `root = md_parser.parse(contents)`.
        - The vulnerability, if present, would reside in the `commonmark.Parser().parse(contents)` call. If `commonmark` has a parsing vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection flaw) that can be triggered by specific Markdown syntax, a malicious Markdown file could exploit it during parsing.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        User's Machine --> Runs pre-commit --> Executes markdown-toc hook -->
        markdown-toc hook calls markdown_links.get_links -->
        markdown_links.get_links uses commonmark.Parser().parse(malicious_markdown_content) -->
        If commonmark parser is vulnerable: Arbitrary code execution on User's Machine
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Identify or create a Markdown file (`malicious.md`) that contains syntax designed to trigger a hypothetical vulnerability in the `commonmark` parser. (For a real test, one would need to research known `commonmark` vulnerabilities and craft an exploit. For demonstration, we can assume a hypothetical vulnerability that triggers on excessively nested Markdown structures or specific character combinations).
    - Step 2: Create a Git repository and place the `malicious.md` file in it.
    - Step 3: Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the repository to include the `markdown-toc` hook from `pre-commit-tool-hooks`.
    ```yaml
    repos:
    -   repo: https://github.com/google/pre-commit-tool-hooks
        rev: vTODO # Replace with a specific revision
        hooks:
        -   id: markdown-toc
    ```
    - Step 4: Run `pre-commit run markdown-toc -a` from the repository root. This will execute the `markdown-toc` hook on all files (including `malicious.md`).
    - Step 5: Observe the outcome.
        - If a vulnerability is successfully exploited, it might lead to:
            - Unexpected program termination or crash.
            - Error messages indicating parsing issues.
            - In a more severe scenario (for demonstration purposes in a controlled environment, and if a real `commonmark` exploit exists), it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, which would be evident by unexpected system behavior or execution of injected commands.
        - If no vulnerability is present or triggered by the crafted input, the hook will likely complete without errors (or might produce errors related to TOC generation if the Markdown is malformed in other ways, but not due to parser exploit).

    - Note: This test case is designed to highlight the *potential* vulnerability due to dependency on `commonmark`. To concretely demonstrate the vulnerability, one would need to find a specific, exploitable flaw in `commonmark` and craft `malicious.md` accordingly. If no known exploit exists, this test case serves to raise awareness of the inherent risks of using complex parsers and the importance of dependency security.
