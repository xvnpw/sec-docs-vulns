### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Markdown Links in `check-links` Hook
- Description:
    1. A developer clones the repository containing the pre-commit hooks and sets up the `pre-commit` framework with the `check-links` hook enabled.
    2. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file containing specially crafted links. These links are designed to exploit a vulnerability in how the `check-links` hook processes local file paths or URLs.
    3. The attacker contributes this malicious markdown file to the repository, for example, by submitting a pull request.
    4. When a developer attempts to commit changes, including the malicious markdown file, the `pre-commit` framework automatically executes the `check-links` hook.
    5. The `check-links` hook processes the malicious markdown file and encounters the specially crafted links.
    6. Due to a vulnerability in the `check-links` hook's link parsing or validation logic, processing these malicious links leads to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. This could occur through various mechanisms, such as exploiting shell commands, path traversal, or other unforeseen interactions with the operating system when handling the crafted links.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine. This can lead to complete compromise of the developer's workstation, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of the attack.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `check-links` hook aims to validate links, but it does not appear to have specific sanitization or security measures to prevent arbitrary code execution from maliciously crafted links.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for link destinations to prevent command injection or path traversal.
    - Strict validation and restriction of link types and paths processed by the hook.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the `check-links` hook execution environment to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of the hook scripts, especially the link parsing and validation logic.
- Preconditions:
    1. A developer has installed the `pre-commit` framework and configured it to use the `check-links` hook from this repository.
    2. A malicious markdown file with specially crafted links is introduced into the repository and is included in the files to be committed.
    3. The developer attempts to commit changes that include the malicious markdown file, triggering the `check-links` hook execution.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `check_links.py` script processes markdown files and validates links using the `markdown_links.py` library.
    - The `_check_links` function in `check_links.py` parses link destinations using `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and resolves local file paths using `pathlib.Path`.
    - While the code checks for file existence and anchor validity, it's possible that vulnerabilities exist in how it handles specific characters in file paths, URLs, or interacts with the underlying operating system during path resolution or file access checks.
    - Specifically, the lines handling local paths:
        ```python
        url_path = Path(dest_url.path)
        if url_path.is_absolute():
            # Absolute paths are actually relative to the repo root.
            dest_path = repo_root.joinpath(dest_url.path.lstrip("/"))
        else:
            # Relative paths are relative to the current file's dir.
            dest_path = absolute_path.parent.joinpath(url_path)
        ```
        and file existence check:
        ```python
        if dest_path.is_dir():
            # ...
        # Verify the file exists.
        if not dest_path.is_file():
            # ...
        # Check anchors.
        if (
            dest_url.fragment
            and dest_url.fragment not in link_cache.get(dest_path)[0]
        ):
            # ...
        ```
        need to be carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided in `dest_url.path`. It's crucial to ensure that no command injection, path traversal, or unexpected file system operations can be triggered through crafted link paths during these operations. The usage of `Path.is_file()` and `Path.is_dir()` might interact with the file system in ways that could be exploited if the path is maliciously crafted.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a local git repository and install the `pre-commit` framework.
    2. Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to include the `check-links` hook from the provided repository.
    3. Create a new markdown file named `malicious.md` in the repository.
    4. Insert a specially crafted link into `malicious.md` that is designed to trigger code execution when processed by `check-links`. For example, try a link with a file path that might be misinterpreted as a command or exploit path traversal if not handled correctly. Example malicious link: `[malicious link](</path/to/potentially/executable/file>)` or `[malicious link](</path/to/directory/that/might/trigger/something>)`.
    5. Attempt to commit `malicious.md` using `git commit -m "Add malicious markdown file"`.
    6. Observe if the `check-links` hook execution leads to arbitrary code execution. Monitor for any unexpected system behavior, execution of commands, or access to unauthorized resources during the pre-commit hook execution.
    7. If code execution is not immediately apparent, try more sophisticated crafted links, including those with special characters, path traversal sequences, or links pointing to unusual file types or locations. For example, test with links like: `[test](</dev/null>)`, `[test](</proc/self/environ>)`, `[test](</tmp/$(touch vulnerable)>)`. Note: Carefully craft test cases to avoid actual harm to the system and focus on demonstrating potential code execution paths.

This vulnerability report highlights the potential for arbitrary code execution in the `check-links` hook due to malicious markdown links. Further investigation and mitigation are strongly recommended to address this critical security risk.
