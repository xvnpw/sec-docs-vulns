## Combined Vulnerability List

### Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Markdown Links in `check-links` Hook

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Markdown Links in `check-links` Hook
- **Description:**
    1. A developer clones the repository containing the pre-commit hooks and sets up the `pre-commit` framework with the `check-links` hook enabled.
    2. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file containing specially crafted links. These links are designed to exploit a vulnerability in how the `check-links` hook processes local file paths or URLs.
    3. The attacker contributes this malicious markdown file to the repository, for example, by submitting a pull request.
    4. When a developer attempts to commit changes, including the malicious markdown file, the `pre-commit` framework automatically executes the `check-links` hook.
    5. The `check-links` hook processes the malicious markdown file and encounters the specially crafted links.
    6. Due to a vulnerability in the `check-links` hook's link parsing or validation logic, processing these malicious links leads to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. This could occur through various mechanisms, such as exploiting shell commands, path traversal, or other unforeseen interactions with the operating system when handling the crafted links.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine. This can lead to complete compromise of the developer's workstation, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of the attack.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided code. The `check-links` hook aims to validate links, but it does not appear to have specific sanitization or security measures to prevent arbitrary code execution from maliciously crafted links.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for link destinations to prevent command injection or path traversal.
    - Strict validation and restriction of link types and paths processed by the hook.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the `check-links` hook execution environment to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of the hook scripts, especially the link parsing and validation logic.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. A developer has installed the `pre-commit` framework and configured it to use the `check-links` hook from this repository.
    2. A malicious markdown file with specially crafted links is introduced into the repository and is included in the files to be committed.
    3. The developer attempts to commit changes that include the malicious markdown file, triggering the `check-links` hook execution.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `check_links.py` script processes markdown files and validates links using the `markdown_links.py` library.
    - The `_check_links` function in `check_links.py` parses link destinations using `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and resolves local file paths using `pathlib.Path`.
    - While the code checks for file existence and anchor validity, it's possible that vulnerabilities exist in how it handles specific characters in file paths, URLs, or interacts with the underlying operating system during path resolution or file access checks.
    - Specifically, the lines handling local paths:
        ```python
        url_path = Path(dest_url.path)
        if url_path.is_absolute():
            # Absolute paths are actually relative to the repo root.
            dest_path = repo_root.joinpath(dest_url.path.lstrip("/"))
        else:
            # Relative paths are relative to the current file's dir.
            dest_path = absolute_path.parent.joinpath(url_path)
        ```
        and file existence check:
        ```python
        if dest_path.is_dir():
            # ...
        # Verify the file exists.
        if not dest_path.is_file():
            # ...
        # Check anchors.
        if (
            dest_url.fragment
            and dest_url.fragment not in link_cache.get(dest_path)[0]
        ):
            # ...
        ```
        need to be carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided in `dest_url.path`. It's crucial to ensure that no command injection, path traversal, or unexpected file system operations can be triggered through crafted link paths during these operations. The usage of `Path.is_file()` and `Path.is_dir()` might interact with the file system in ways that could be exploited if the path is maliciously crafted.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a local git repository and install the `pre-commit` framework.
    2. Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to include the `check-links` hook from the provided repository.
    3. Create a new markdown file named `malicious.md` in the repository.
    4. Insert a specially crafted link into `malicious.md` that is designed to trigger code execution when processed by `check-links`. For example, try a link with a file path that might be misinterpreted as a command or exploit path traversal if not handled correctly. Example malicious link: `[malicious link](</path/to/potentially/executable/file>)` or `[malicious link](</path/to/directory/that/might/trigger/something>)`.
    5. Attempt to commit `malicious.md` using `git commit -m "Add malicious markdown file"`.
    6. Observe if the `check-links` hook execution leads to arbitrary code execution. Monitor for any unexpected system behavior, execution of commands, or access to unauthorized resources during the pre-commit hook execution.
    7. If code execution is not immediately apparent, try more sophisticated crafted links, including those with special characters, path traversal sequences, or links pointing to unusual file types or locations. For example, test with links like: `[test](</dev/null>)`, `[test](</proc/self/environ>)`, `[test](</tmp/$(touch vulnerable)>)`. Note: Carefully craft test cases to avoid actual harm to the system and focus on demonstrating potential code execution paths.


### Markdown Parsing Vulnerability in `markdown-toc` hook

- **Vulnerability Name:** Markdown Parsing Vulnerability in `markdown-toc` hook
- **Description:**
    - A malicious actor could craft a Markdown file that exploits a potential vulnerability in the `commonmark` library, which is used by the `markdown-toc` hook to parse Markdown content.
    - When a developer runs `pre-commit` on a repository containing this malicious Markdown file, the `markdown-toc` hook will process the file.
    - If the `commonmark` library is vulnerable, parsing the malicious Markdown file could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's local machine. This is because the `markdown-toc` hook is executed locally during the pre-commit stage.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's local machine. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project relies on the security of the `commonmark` library. There is no input sanitization or vulnerability mitigation implemented within the `markdown-toc` hook itself to address potential `commonmark` vulnerabilities.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies, including `commonmark`, for known vulnerabilities and update to patched versions. While the project doesn't directly manage `commonmark` version, it can document the dependency and recommend users to ensure they are using a secure environment with updated libraries.
    - Consider using a sandboxed environment or more secure markdown parsing approach if feasible, although this might be complex and impact functionality. For pre-commit hooks, the primary mitigation is to be aware of the risk and keep dependencies updated in the development environment.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have configured the `pre-commit-tool-hooks` in their `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and included the `markdown-toc` hook in their pre-commit checks.
    - The user must run `pre-commit` on a Git repository that contains a maliciously crafted Markdown file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `pre_commit_hooks/markdown_toc.py`:
        - The `_update_toc` function reads the content of Markdown files specified in `paths`.
        - It calls `markdown_links.get_links(contents)` to parse the Markdown content and extract headers.
    - `pre_commit_hooks/markdown_links.py`:
        - The `get_links` function utilizes the `commonmark` library to parse Markdown content using `md_parser = commonmark.Parser()` and `root = md_parser.parse(contents)`.
        - The vulnerability, if present, would reside in the `commonmark.Parser().parse(contents)` call. If `commonmark` has a parsing vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection flaw) that can be triggered by specific Markdown syntax, a malicious Markdown file could exploit it during parsing.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        User's Machine --> Runs pre-commit --> Executes markdown-toc hook -->
        markdown-toc hook calls markdown_links.get_links -->
        markdown_links.get_links uses commonmark.Parser().parse(malicious_markdown_content) -->
        If commonmark parser is vulnerable: Arbitrary code execution on User's Machine
        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Identify or create a Markdown file (`malicious.md`) that contains syntax designed to trigger a hypothetical vulnerability in the `commonmark` parser. (For a real test, one would need to research known `commonmark` vulnerabilities and craft an exploit. For demonstration, we can assume a hypothetical vulnerability that triggers on excessively nested Markdown structures or specific character combinations).
    - Step 2: Create a Git repository and place the `malicious.md` file in it.
    - Step 3: Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the repository to include the `markdown-toc` hook from `pre-commit-tool-hooks`.
    ```yaml
    repos:
    -   repo: https://github.com/google/pre-commit-tool-hooks
        rev: vTODO # Replace with a specific revision
        hooks:
        -   id: markdown-toc
    ```
    - Step 4: Run `pre-commit run markdown-toc -a` from the repository root. This will execute the `markdown-toc` hook on all files (including `malicious.md`).
    - Step 5: Observe the outcome.
        - If a vulnerability is successfully exploited, it might lead to:
            - Unexpected program termination or crash.
            - Error messages indicating parsing issues.
            - In a more severe scenario (for demonstration purposes in a controlled environment, and if a real `commonmark` exploit exists), it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, which would be evident by unexpected system behavior or execution of injected commands.
        - If no vulnerability is present or triggered by the crafted input, the hook will likely complete without errors (or might produce errors related to TOC generation if the Markdown is malformed in other ways, but not due to parser exploit).

    - Note: This test case is designed to highlight the *potential* vulnerability due to dependency on `commonmark`. To concretely demonstrate the vulnerability, one would need to find a specific, exploitable flaw in `commonmark` and craft `malicious.md` accordingly. If no known exploit exists, this test case serves to raise awareness of the inherent risks of using complex parsers and the importance of dependency security.
