- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON Data
- Description: A user can create a JSON data file that, when opened in the Filonov web application, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This is possible because the application does not properly sanitize data from the JSON file before rendering it in the web page.
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious JSON file containing JavaScript code, for example within an asset name field.
    2. Attacker hosts this malicious JSON file on a publicly accessible server or tricks a user into using a local file path.
    3. Victim opens the Filonov web application (http://filonov-ai.web.app) in their browser.
    4. Victim uses the "Open from URL" or "Open local file" functionality within the Filonov web application to load the attacker's malicious JSON file.
    5. The Filonov web application reads and processes the JSON data.
    6. Due to lack of input sanitization, when the application renders the data from the JSON file into the web page, the embedded JavaScript code is executed by the victim's browser.
- Impact: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    - Stealing sensitive information: Accessing and exfiltrating data from local storage, cookies, or other browser-accessible data.
    - Website defacement: Altering the visual appearance of the web application as seen by the victim.
    - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled websites for phishing or malware distribution.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user: If the application interacts with other services or has functionalities that can be triggered via JavaScript, the attacker could potentially perform actions as the victim.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided project files (which primarily focus on the backend data pipeline and deployment), there are no visible mitigations implemented in the project files to prevent XSS in the web application. The application is described as "completely serverless" and "publicly available" with no mention of security measures for the frontend data visualization component.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The web application is missing input sanitization for data read from the JSON file. All data from the JSON, especially string values that are rendered in the UI, should be sanitized to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious code.
    - Output encoding: The application is missing proper output encoding when rendering data from the JSON file into HTML. HTML special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`) should be encoded to their HTML entities to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML code. For example, using HTML entity encoding (e.g., replacing `<` with `&lt;`, `>` with `&gt;`, etc.) when displaying asset names or descriptions.
- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker can create a malicious JSON data file.
    2. Victim user opens the Filonov web application in a web browser.
    3. Victim user loads the malicious JSON data file into the Filonov web application, either from a URL or a local file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not include the source code for the Filonov web application (which is stated to be Typescript). Therefore, direct source code analysis of the web application's data handling is not possible with the given files.
    - However, based on the description of the vulnerability and the general architecture of such applications, the vulnerability likely occurs in the Typescript code of the web application when it processes and renders data from the JSON file.
    - **Assumed vulnerable code flow in the web application (Conceptual):**
        1. Web application fetches or reads the JSON data file.
        2. Parses JSON into JavaScript objects.
        3. Extracts data, for example, asset names from the JSON data.
        4. Dynamically generates HTML to display the visualization, embedding the extracted data directly into HTML elements, likely using string interpolation or similar methods without encoding.
        5. Sets the innerHTML of a DOM element with the generated HTML.
    - **Visualization of Vulnerable Code Flow (Conceptual):**
        ```
        [Malicious JSON File] --> [Filonov Web App (Typescript)]
                                        |
                                        V
        [Read JSON Data] --> [Parse JSON] --> [Extract Data (e.g., asset names)] --> [Generate HTML (Unsafe String Interpolation)] --> [Set innerHTML] --> [XSS Execution in Browser]
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious JSON file named `xss_payload.json` with the following content. This payload includes a JavaScript `alert` function within the `name` field of an asset:
        ```json
        {
          "assets": [
            {
              "id": "asset1",
              "name": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Alert: Malicious JSON Loaded');</script>",
              "similarity": 0.85
            },
            {
              "id": "asset2",
              "name": "Clean Asset Name",
              "similarity": 0.92
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    2. Host this `xss_payload.json` file on a simple HTTP server. For example, using Python: `python -m http.server 8080` in the directory where you saved `xss_payload.json`. Note the URL, which will be something like `http://localhost:8080/xss_payload.json`.
    3. Open the Filonov web application in your browser: http://filonov-ai.web.app.
    4. Use the "Open from URL" functionality in the Filonov web application.
    5. Enter the URL of your hosted malicious JSON file (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/xss_payload.json`) into the input field and click "Open".
    6. Observe the behavior of the web application. If a JavaScript alert box appears in your browser with the message "XSS Vulnerability Alert: Malicious JSON Loaded", it confirms the XSS vulnerability. This indicates that the application executed the JavaScript code embedded in the JSON data because of insufficient sanitization.
