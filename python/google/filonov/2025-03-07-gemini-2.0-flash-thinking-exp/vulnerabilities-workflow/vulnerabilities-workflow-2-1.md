- Vulnerability name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON File

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON file. This file contains JavaScript code embedded within data fields that are intended to be displayed by the Filonov web application.
  2. The attacker entices a victim to open this malicious JSON file using the Filonov web application, either by uploading it locally or providing a link to a remotely hosted file.
  3. When the victim opens the malicious JSON file, the web application processes the data and, due to insufficient sanitization, renders the embedded JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
  4. The victim's browser executes the attacker's JavaScript code within the context of the Filonov web application.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they use the Filonov web application. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    - Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
    - Displaying fake login prompts to steal credentials.
    - Defacing the web application interface as seen by the victim.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim within the web application.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit mention or evidence of input sanitization or output encoding within the web application to prevent XSS. The application is described as "completely serverless" and "publicly available," suggesting a focus on functionality over security in the current implementation.  No specific code snippets or configurations are present in the provided files that indicate XSS mitigation.

- Missing mitigations:
  The following mitigations are missing in the project to prevent XSS vulnerabilities:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of all user-provided data, especially data from JSON files, before processing and rendering it in the web application. This includes escaping or removing HTML tags and JavaScript code.
    - Output encoding: Encode data before displaying it in the HTML context to prevent browsers from interpreting it as executable code. Use context-aware output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML context, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript context).
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict Content Security Policy to control the sources from which the web application can load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the capabilities of injected scripts.

- Preconditions:
  - The victim must be enticed to open a maliciously crafted JSON file using the Filonov web application.
  - The Filonov web application must be accessible to the victim (it is publicly available as per the README).
  - The web application must process and render data from the JSON file without proper sanitization or output encoding.

- Source code analysis:
  As no front-end source code is provided, we can only infer the potential vulnerability based on the project description and typical web application patterns.
  1. **Assumption:** The web application uses JavaScript to parse and render the JSON data.
  2. **Potential Vulnerable Code Flow (Hypothetical):**
     - The web application has a function that loads a JSON file, for example, `loadGraphData(jsonData)`.
     - This function parses the JSON data using `JSON.parse(jsonData)`.
     - The parsed data is then used to dynamically generate HTML elements to visualize the graph.
     - If the JSON data contains malicious JavaScript within properties that are used to generate HTML content (e.g., node labels, tooltips, etc.), and these properties are directly inserted into the HTML without encoding, XSS will occur.

  **Visualization (Hypothetical DOM structure before and after exploit):**

  **Before opening malicious JSON:**
  ```html
  <div id="graph-container">
    <!-- Graph visualization elements will be rendered here -->
  </div>
  ```

  **Malicious JSON Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "node1",
        "label": "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS Vulnerability!\")'>"
      },
      {
        "id": "node2",
        "label": "Clean Label"
      }
    ],
    "edges": []
  }
  ```

  **After opening malicious JSON (Hypothetical vulnerable rendering):**
  ```html
  <div id="graph-container">
    <!-- ... other graph elements ... -->
    <div class="node">
      <span><img src='x' onerror='alert("XSS Vulnerability!")'></span> <!-- Malicious script injected -->
    </div>
    <div class="node">
      <span>Clean Label</span>
    </div>
    <!-- ... other graph elements ... -->
  </div>
  ```
  In this hypothetical scenario, the `label` property of the JSON node is directly inserted into the HTML `span` element. The `<img>` tag with the `onerror` attribute will execute JavaScript when the image fails to load (which it will, due to `src='x'`), triggering the `alert("XSS Vulnerability!")`.  A real attacker would inject more harmful scripts.

- Security test case:
  1. **Prepare Malicious JSON File:** Create a JSON file (e.g., `malicious.json`) with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "nodes": [
         {
           "id": "xss-node",
           "label": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability - Cookie: ' + document.cookie)</script>"
         }
       ],
       "edges": []
     }
     ```
     This JSON file contains a node with a label that includes a `<script>` tag. This script will attempt to display an alert box showing the document's cookies if the XSS is successful.
  2. **Access Filonov Web Application:** Open the Filonov web application in a browser by navigating to http://filonov-ai.web.app.
  3. **Open the Malicious JSON File:**
     - If the application supports local file upload: Use the application's "Open File" or "Upload" functionality to open the `malicious.json` file from your local system.
     - If the application supports remote links: Host the `malicious.json` file on a web server accessible via a URL (e.g., using a simple HTTP server or a service like `gist.github.com`). Then, use the application's "Open Link" functionality (if available) and provide the URL to your hosted `malicious.json` file. If there is no explicit "Open Link" functionality, try to construct a URL that might trigger loading from a remote source, if applicable.
  4. **Observe for XSS:** After opening the JSON file, observe the behavior of the web application.
     - **Successful XSS:** If a JavaScript alert box appears, displaying "XSS Vulnerability - Cookie: ..." (followed by cookie information or an empty string if no cookies are set), then the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
     - **No XSS:** If no alert box appears and the application renders without executing the JavaScript, then the vulnerability is either not present or mitigated. (In this case, based on the analysis, it is expected to be present).

  **Expected result:** Upon opening the `malicious.json` file, a JavaScript alert box should appear in the browser, demonstrating that the injected JavaScript code from the JSON file was executed, thus confirming the XSS vulnerability.
