* Vulnerability Name: Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON File
* Description:
    - An attacker can craft a malicious JSON file.
    - This JSON file is designed to contain embedded JavaScript code within data fields, such as labels or descriptions of nodes in the graph data.
    - A victim user opens this malicious JSON file using the Filonov web application, either locally or via a remote link.
    - The Filonov web application parses the JSON file using JavaScript.
    - When the application renders the graph visualization, it processes the data from the JSON file and dynamically inserts it into the web page, likely using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
    - If the application fails to properly sanitize or encode the data from the JSON file before inserting it into the DOM, the embedded JavaScript code will be executed by the victim's browser.
    - This execution of arbitrary JavaScript code constitutes a client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session, in the context of the Filonov web application.
    - This can lead to a range of malicious actions, including:
        - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to any services or accounts accessible through the web application if it had authentication.
        - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information that the user can view within the Filonov application, or potentially data from other websites or browser storage if permissions allow.
        - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites that could host malware or initiate drive-by downloads.
        - **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web application for the victim, potentially to spread misinformation or damage trust.
        - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login prompts or other deceptive content to trick the user into revealing credentials or personal information.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Based on the description in `/code/README.md`, the web application is serverless and publicly accessible without any authorization.
    - There is no indication in the provided project files (which primarily describe the backend and project setup) that any input sanitization or output encoding is implemented in the web application's client-side JavaScript code.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The web application must sanitize all data extracted from the JSON file before using it to update the DOM. This involves removing or escaping any HTML tags or JavaScript code within the JSON data values.
    - **Output Encoding:**  When rendering data from the JSON file into the web page, the application should use appropriate output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to ensure that any potentially malicious content is treated as plain text and not executable code.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a Content Security Policy would provide an additional layer of defense by restricting the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the actions an attacker can take even if they manage to inject script code.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to create and host or distribute a malicious JSON file.
    - The victim user must access the publicly available Filonov web application (http://filonov-ai.web.app).
    - The victim user must then open the malicious JSON file within the Filonov web application. This could be through a file upload mechanism in the UI or by pasting a link to the malicious JSON if the application supports loading data from URLs.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - As the source code for the web application's UI is not provided within these project files, a detailed code walkthrough is not possible. However, we can infer the likely vulnerability points based on typical JavaScript web application patterns for handling JSON data and rendering visualizations.
    - **Assumed Vulnerable Code Pattern:**
        - The web application uses JavaScript to fetch and parse the user-provided JSON file.
        - It then processes this JSON data to dynamically generate the graph visualization.
        - A critical vulnerability point arises if the JavaScript code directly uses data from the JSON to manipulate the HTML structure of the page without proper escaping. For instance, if the application uses `innerHTML` to insert node labels or other text content derived directly from the JSON data into HTML elements.

    - **Example Vulnerable Scenario:**
        - Assume the JSON data structure includes fields like `label` for nodes.
        - If the JavaScript code contains lines similar to this (pseudocode):
          ```javascript
          const nodeLabelElement = document.createElement('div');
          nodeLabelElement.innerHTML = jsonData.nodes[i].label; // Directly using innerHTML without sanitization
          // ... append nodeLabelElement to the DOM
          ```
        - And if a malicious JSON file contains data like:
          ```json
          {
              "nodes": [
                  { "id": "1", "label": "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>" },
                  // ... more nodes
              ],
              "edges": [
                  // ... edges
              ]
          }
          ```
        - When the web application processes this JSON and executes the `innerHTML` assignment, the browser will interpret the `<img>` tag and execute the `onerror` JavaScript, triggering the `alert('XSS')`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare the Malicious JSON File:**
        - Create a new text file named `malicious.json`.
        - Paste the following JSON content into the file. This JSON is crafted to include a node with a label that contains JavaScript code that will trigger an alert box when rendered by a vulnerable application:
          ```json
          {
            "nodes": [
              {
                "id": "xss-test",
                "label": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected! This proves that JavaScript code from the JSON file can be executed in the Filonov web application. An attacker could perform more harmful actions.');</script>",
                "x": 100,
                "y": 100
              }
            ],
            "edges": []
          }
          ```
    2. **Access the Filonov Web Application:**
        - Open a web browser and navigate to the publicly accessible Filonov web application: `http://filonov-ai.web.app`.
    3. **Open the Malicious JSON File in Filonov:**
        - Within the Filonov web application's user interface, locate the functionality to open or load a JSON file. This might be a button labeled "Open File," "Import Data," or similar.
        - Use this functionality to open the `malicious.json` file that you created in step 1. If the application supports loading from a local file, upload `malicious.json`. If it supports loading from a URL, you would need to host `malicious.json` on a web server and provide the URL.
    4. **Observe for XSS Execution:**
        - After loading the `malicious.json` file, carefully observe the web application in your browser.
        - **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation):** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, you should see an alert dialog box appear in your browser window. The alert box will display the message: "XSS Vulnerability Detected! This proves that JavaScript code from the JSON file can be executed in the Filonov web application. An attacker could perform more harmful actions."
        - If you see this alert box, it confirms that the Filonov web application is indeed vulnerable to client-side XSS through the loading of malicious JSON files.
