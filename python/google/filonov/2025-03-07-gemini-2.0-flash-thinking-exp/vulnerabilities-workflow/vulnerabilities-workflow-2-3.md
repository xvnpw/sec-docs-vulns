### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON File Upload
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON file.
    2. This JSON file contains JavaScript code embedded within data fields that are intended to be displayed by the Filonov Data Visualization web application.
    3. The attacker uploads or hosts this malicious JSON file, making it accessible via a URL or providing it locally if the application supports local file opening.
    4. A user, intending to analyze data, opens this malicious JSON file using the Filonov Data Visualization web application, either by providing the URL to the malicious file or by loading it locally.
    5. The web application processes the JSON data. Due to the absence of proper input sanitization and output encoding, the embedded JavaScript code from the malicious JSON file is executed within the user's web browser.
* Impact:
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they are using the Filonov Data Visualization web application.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
        - Cookie theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information stored in cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
        - Defacement of the web page: Altering the visual appearance of the web application for malicious purposes.
        - Data theft: Potentially accessing and exfiltrating data accessible by the web application.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user: If the application has any authenticated actions, the attacker could potentially perform actions as the user.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit mention of input sanitization or output encoding implemented in the Filonov Data Visualization web application. The application is described as serverless and publicly accessible, which increases the risk if proper security measures are not in place.  No mitigations are evident from the provided files.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The web application needs to sanitize all data received from the JSON file before processing and displaying it. This includes removing or encoding any potentially malicious JavaScript code or HTML tags.
    - **Output Encoding:** When displaying data from the JSON file in the web application, output encoding should be implemented. This ensures that any potentially malicious code is rendered as text and not executed as code. For example, using HTML entity encoding.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks. CSP allows defining trusted sources for various web resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can prevent the browser from executing inline scripts or loading scripts from untrusted domains, which are common vectors for XSS attacks.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Performing regular security audits and code reviews, especially for the data visualization component, is crucial to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities proactively.
* Preconditions:
    - A user must use the Filonov Data Visualization web application and open a maliciously crafted JSON data file.
    - The Filonov Data Visualization web application must be vulnerable to XSS, meaning it lacks sufficient input sanitization and output encoding when processing and displaying data from the JSON file.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - As no source code for the UI is provided within the PROJECT FILES, we can only infer the potential vulnerability based on the project description and common web application practices.
    - Assuming the web application is built using JavaScript and dynamically renders content based on the JSON data, a common vulnerability arises when using methods like `innerHTML` to insert data from the JSON directly into the DOM without proper sanitization.
    - Example of potentially vulnerable code (hypothetical JavaScript in the UI):

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical vulnerable Javascript code in Filonov UI (ui/creative-maps/app.js or similar)
    function displayGraphData(jsonData) {
        const graphContainer = document.getElementById('graph-container');
        // Vulnerable code: Directly using innerHTML without sanitization
        graphContainer.innerHTML = `
            <h1>${jsonData.graphTitle}</h1>
            <div id="graph"></div>
            <p>Description: ${jsonData.graphDescription}</p>
            <ul>
                ${jsonData.nodes.map(node => `<li>Node: ${node.label}</li>`).join('')}
            </ul>
        `;
        // ... code to render the graph using jsonData ...
    }

    // ... code to fetch and process JSON data and call displayGraphData ...
    ```

    - In this hypothetical code, if `jsonData.graphTitle`, `jsonData.graphDescription`, or `node.label` in the JSON data contain malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed when the browser processes `innerHTML`. For example, if `jsonData.graphTitle` in the JSON file is set to `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>`, this script will be executed when the `displayGraphData` function is called and the content is rendered in the `graphContainer`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious JSON File:** Create a JSON file named `malicious_filonov_data.json` with the following content. This JSON is crafted to inject a simple JavaScript `alert()` when processed by a vulnerable web application:

    ```json
    {
      "graphTitle": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability in Filonov Data Visualization!')</script>",
      "graphDescription": "Malicious graph data to demonstrate XSS.",
      "nodes": [
        {"id": 1, "label": "Node 1"},
        {"id": 2, "label": "Node 2"}
      ],
      "edges": []
    }
    ```

    2. **Host the Malicious JSON File (Optional for local testing):** If testing against a deployed instance or simulating a URL load, host this `malicious_filonov_data.json` file on a web server accessible to the Filonov Data Visualization web application. For local testing, this step can be skipped, assuming the application allows opening local files.

    3. **Access the Filonov Data Visualization Web Application:** Open the Filonov Data Visualization web application in a web browser by navigating to `http://filonov-ai.web.app`.

    4. **Open the Malicious JSON File:**
        - **If testing via URL:** Use the application's "Open data file from URL" feature (if available) and provide the URL to the hosted `malicious_filonov_data.json` file.
        - **If testing locally:** Use the application's "Open data file locally" feature (if available) and select the `malicious_filonov_data.json` file from your local file system.

    5. **Observe for XSS Execution:** After loading the malicious JSON file, observe the behavior of the web application in your browser.
        - **Expected Vulnerable Outcome:** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability in Filonov Data Visualization!" should appear in your browser window. This indicates that the JavaScript code embedded in the `graphTitle` field of the JSON file has been executed.
        - **Expected Secure Outcome (if mitigated):** If the application has proper XSS mitigations in place, the alert box should not appear. Instead, the title might be displayed as raw text including the `<script>` tags, or the script might be removed or encoded, preventing its execution.

    6. **Verification:** The appearance of the alert box confirms the presence of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Filonov Data Visualization web application due to insufficient sanitization of data from the JSON file. This test case proves that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by providing a maliciously crafted JSON file to the application.
