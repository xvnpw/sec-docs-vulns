## Vulnerabilities Found

The following vulnerability was identified in the application:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON File

- Description:
  An attacker can craft a malicious JSON file containing embedded JavaScript code within data fields intended for display in the Filonov web application. When a victim opens this file using the application, either by uploading it locally or providing a link to a remotely hosted file, the application processes the JSON data. Due to the lack of input sanitization and output encoding, the embedded JavaScript code is rendered and executed within the victim's browser. This occurs because the application directly inserts data from the JSON file into the HTML DOM without proper security measures, leading to the execution of the attacker's script.

  1. Attacker crafts a malicious JSON file containing JavaScript code, for example within data fields like node labels, asset names, graph titles or descriptions.
  2. Attacker hosts this malicious JSON file on a publicly accessible server or tricks a user into using a local file path.
  3. Victim opens the Filonov web application (http://filonov-ai.web.app) in their browser.
  4. Victim uses the "Open from URL" or "Open local file" functionality within the Filonov web application to load the attacker's malicious JSON file.
  5. The Filonov web application reads and processes the JSON data.
  6. Due to lack of input sanitization and output encoding, when the application renders the data from the JSON file into the web page, the embedded JavaScript code is executed by the victim's browser.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they use the Filonov web application. This can lead to severe security consequences, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to the application or other services.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information accessible within the web application, including potentially data from local storage, cookies, or other browser-accessible data.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the victim to malicious websites, potentially leading to malware infections or further attacks.
    - **Website Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web application as seen by the victim, damaging trust and potentially spreading misinformation.
    - **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fake login prompts or other deceptive content to steal user credentials or personal information.
    - **Performing Actions on Behalf of the User:**  Executing actions within the web application as the victim, if the application has functionalities that can be triggered via JavaScript.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  Based on the analysis of the project description and the publicly available nature of the application, there are no currently implemented mitigations to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The application is described as "completely serverless" and "publicly available," suggesting a focus on functionality over security in the current implementation. No input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms are evident in the project description.

- Missing mitigations:
  To effectively mitigate the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, the following mitigations are essential:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of all user-provided data, especially data read from JSON files, before processing and rendering it in the web application. This includes removing or neutralizing any potentially malicious code, such as HTML tags and JavaScript code.
    - **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it in the HTML context to prevent browsers from interpreting it as executable code. Use context-aware output encoding, such as HTML entity encoding for HTML context, to ensure that special characters are rendered as text and not as code.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the sources from which the web application can load resources. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by restricting the capabilities of injected scripts and preventing the execution of inline scripts or scripts from untrusted domains.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on the data visualization component and data handling processes, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
  - The victim must be enticed to open a maliciously crafted JSON file using the Filonov web application.
  - The Filonov web application must be accessible to the victim (it is publicly available at http://filonov-ai.web.app).
  - The web application must process and render data from the JSON file without proper sanitization or output encoding.

- Source code analysis:
  As the front-end source code of the Filonov web application is not provided, the source code analysis is based on assumptions about typical JavaScript web application patterns and potential vulnerable code flows. It is assumed that the application uses JavaScript to parse and render JSON data dynamically in the browser.

  1. **Assumed Vulnerable Code Flow:**
     - The web application loads a JSON file, either from a local file or a remote URL, using JavaScript.
     - The application parses the JSON data using `JSON.parse()`.
     - Data from the parsed JSON is extracted and used to dynamically generate HTML elements for the user interface, such as graph visualizations, node labels, titles, and descriptions.
     - If the extracted data, especially string values from the JSON, is directly inserted into the HTML DOM using methods like `innerHTML` or string interpolation without proper encoding or sanitization, it creates an XSS vulnerability.

  2. **Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Example (JavaScript):**
     ```javascript
     function displayGraphData(jsonData) {
         const graphContainer = document.getElementById('graph-container');
         let graphHTML = `<h1>${jsonData.graphTitle}</h1>`; // Vulnerable: Unencoded data
         jsonData.nodes.forEach(node => {
             graphHTML += `<div>Node Label: ${node.label}</div>`; // Vulnerable: Unencoded data
         });
         graphContainer.innerHTML = graphHTML; // Vulnerable: Using innerHTML with unencoded data
     }
     ```

  3. **Visualization of Vulnerable Code Flow:**
     ```
     [Malicious JSON File] --> [Filonov Web App (Client-Side JavaScript)]
                                     |
                                     V
     [Read JSON Data] --> [Parse JSON] --> [Extract Data (e.g., graphTitle, node.label)] --> [Generate HTML (Unsafe String Interpolation/innerHTML)] --> [Set innerHTML] --> [XSS Execution in Browser]
     ```

- Security test case:
  To verify the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, the following security test case can be executed:

  1. **Prepare Malicious JSON File:** Create a JSON file named `malicious.json` with the following content. This JSON payload includes JavaScript code within a node label designed to trigger an alert box when rendered by a vulnerable application.
     ```json
     {
       "nodes": [
         {
           "id": "xss-node",
           "label": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected! - Cookie: ' + document.cookie)</script>"
         }
       ],
       "edges": []
     }
     ```

  2. **Access Filonov Web Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the Filonov web application at http://filonov-ai.web.app.

  3. **Open the Malicious JSON File:**
     - **Local File Upload (if supported):** If the application provides an "Open File" or "Upload" button, use it to select and open the `malicious.json` file from your local system.
     - **Remote URL (if supported):** If the application allows loading data from a URL, host the `malicious.json` file on a web server (e.g., using `python -m http.server` locally) and use the application's "Open from URL" functionality to provide the URL to your hosted malicious JSON file.

  4. **Observe for XSS Execution:** After loading the `malicious.json` file, carefully observe the behavior of the web application in your browser.
     - **Expected Vulnerable Outcome:** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, a JavaScript alert box should appear in your browser. The alert box will display the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected! - Cookie: ..." (followed by cookie information or an empty string). This confirms that the JavaScript code embedded in the JSON file was executed within the context of the Filonov web application.
     - **Expected Secure Outcome (if mitigated):** If the application has proper XSS mitigations, the alert box should not appear. Instead, the application should render the data without executing the JavaScript code, potentially displaying the malicious script as plain text.

  5. **Verification:** The appearance of the JavaScript alert box confirms the presence of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Filonov web application due to insufficient sanitization of data from JSON files. This test case demonstrates that an attacker can successfully inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by providing a maliciously crafted JSON file to the application.
