* Vulnerability Name: Insufficient GeoJSON Input Validation
* Description:
    1. The Cloud Function receives a GeoJSON geometry as input from the `region` parameter in the JSON request body.
    2. The code directly passes this GeoJSON to the `ee.Feature()` constructor from the Earth Engine Python API without any explicit validation.
    3. If a malicious actor provides a crafted GeoJSON payload that is technically valid but excessively large, complex, or contains unexpected structures, it can be processed by Earth Engine.
    4. This processing of unvalidated, potentially malicious GeoJSON could lead to errors within the Cloud Function or performance degradation in Earth Engine processing.
    5. While Earth Engine might perform some internal validation, relying solely on this implicit validation without explicit checks in the Cloud Function introduces risk.
* Impact:
    - Service disruption: Processing invalid or overly complex GeoJSON can lead to errors in the Cloud Function, causing it to fail and disrupt service availability for legitimate users. The function might become unresponsive or return internal server errors.
    - Potential for incorrect predictions: Although less likely in this specific code due to the nature of Earth Engine's geospatial processing which is designed to handle various inputs, malformed or unexpected GeoJSON could theoretically be parsed in a way that results in unintended or inaccurate geometries being processed, leading to incorrect risk calculations.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code directly uses the input GeoJSON without any explicit validation steps.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - GeoJSON Schema Validation: Implement validation of the input GeoJSON against a defined schema. This would ensure that the GeoJSON conforms to the expected structure, data types, and properties before being processed by Earth Engine. Libraries like `jsonschema` in Python can be used for this purpose.
    - GeoJSON Size and Complexity Limits: Implement checks to enforce limits on the size and complexity of the GeoJSON geometry. This could include:
        - Limiting the maximum number of coordinates in a geometry.
        - Restricting the complexity of polygons (e.g., number of vertices, nested polygons).
        - Limiting the overall size of the GeoJSON payload.
    - Robust Error Handling: Enhance error handling within the Cloud Function to specifically catch potential exceptions that might arise from invalid GeoJSON inputs or issues during Earth Engine processing. When invalid input is detected, the function should return a clear and informative error message to the user, rather than failing silently or with generic server errors.
* Preconditions:
    - The Cloud Function endpoint must be publicly accessible or accessible to an attacker.
    - The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the Cloud Function endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - In both `palm_conversion_risk.py` and `palm_presence_risk.py`, the following lines are responsible for processing the input GeoJSON:
        ```python
        request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
        region_geojson = request_json['region']
        input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)
        ```
    - `request.get_json(silent=True)`: This line attempts to parse the request body as JSON. `silent=True` prevents it from raising an exception if the body is not valid JSON, instead returning `None`. However, the code does not check if `request_json` is `None` before accessing `request_json['region']`, which could lead to a `TypeError` if the request body is not JSON.  While this is a potential error, it is more of an application stability issue.
    - `region_geojson = request_json['region']`: This line retrieves the value associated with the 'region' key from the parsed JSON. If the 'region' key is missing in the JSON request, this will raise a `KeyError`. Again, this is an application-level error.
    - `input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)`: This is the crucial line where the unvalidated `region_geojson` is passed to the Earth Engine API. The `ee.Feature()` constructor is expected to handle GeoJSON, but there is no explicit validation of the content or structure of `region_geojson` before this point in the Cloud Function code. The function trusts that the input 'region' is a valid and well-formed GeoJSON without any prior checks.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a crafted GeoJSON payload**: Create a JSON file (e.g., `malicious_geojson.json`) containing a GeoJSON object that is designed to be excessively large or complex. For instance, create a Polygon with an extremely high number of vertices (e.g., >100,000 vertices). Example of a very large polygon GeoJSON structure (simplified for brevity):
        ```json
        {
          "type": "Feature",
          "geometry": {
            "type": "Polygon",
            "coordinates": [
              [
                [10, 10], [10.1, 10], [10.1, 10.1], ..., [10, 10]  // Many many vertices here
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
    2. **Send a POST request to the Cloud Function endpoint**: Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the deployed Cloud Function URL (e.g., `/palm_transitions` or `/palm_presence_risk`). Include the crafted GeoJSON in the request body as the value for the `region` key. Ensure to include the necessary authorization header as described in the `README.md`.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://<cloud_function_url> \
        -H "Authorization: bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$(cat malicious_geojson.json)"
        ```
        where `malicious_geojson.json` contains:
        ```json
        {
          "region": {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
              "type": "Polygon",
              "coordinates": [
                [
                  [115.707, -3.338], [115.724, -3.338], [115.724, -3.324], ... , [115.707, -3.338]  // Imagine thousands of coordinates here
                ]
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    3. **Observe the Cloud Function's response**: Check the response from the Cloud Function. If the vulnerability is present, the Cloud Function might:
        - Take a significantly longer time to respond than usual requests.
        - Return an error (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, timeout).
        - Fail to respond at all.
    4. **Examine Cloud Function logs**: Check the logs of the Cloud Function in the Google Cloud Console for any error messages, warnings, or performance degradation indicators that correlate with the time of the test request. Look for timeouts or resource exhaustion errors.
    5. **Expected Result**:  Without input validation, submitting a request with a very complex GeoJSON is expected to either cause a timeout, a server error, or significantly degrade the performance of the Cloud Function. Ideally, with proper validation implemented as missing mitigations, the Cloud Function should reject the request upfront with an informative error message indicating that the provided GeoJSON is too complex or invalid.
