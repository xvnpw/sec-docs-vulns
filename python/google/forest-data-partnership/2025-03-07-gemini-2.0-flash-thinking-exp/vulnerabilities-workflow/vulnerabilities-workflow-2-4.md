- Vulnerability Name: GeoJSON Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker sends a POST request to the Cloud Function endpoint.
    2. The request body contains a JSON payload with a 'region' parameter.
    3. The 'region' parameter is expected to be a GeoJSON object defining the area of interest for analysis.
    4. The Cloud Function code directly parses the GeoJSON from the request body without any explicit validation or sanitization.
    5. This unvalidated GeoJSON is then directly used to create an Earth Engine Feature object (`ee.Feature(region_geojson)`) for subsequent geospatial analysis.
    6. By crafting a malicious GeoJSON payload, an attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in how Earth Engine processes GeoJSON data. This might lead to unexpected behavior, errors during Earth Engine processing, or in certain scenarios, information disclosure. For instance, a very complex GeoJSON could cause excessive resource consumption or trigger errors in Earth Engine's geometry processing.
- Impact:
    - Potential for information disclosure if a crafted GeoJSON can be used to manipulate Earth Engine queries to access or reveal sensitive data.
    - Unexpected behavior or errors in the Cloud Function execution, possibly leading to inaccurate analysis results or service disruptions.
    - Potential performance degradation within Earth Engine if overly complex or maliciously structured GeoJSON is processed, although this is less likely to be a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Cloud Function itself, but rather within the Earth Engine backend.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - HTTPS trigger with authentication enforced by default Cloud Function settings. This requires callers to have valid Google Cloud credentials and permissions to invoke the function, which mitigates unauthorized public access to the API endpoint. However, it does not prevent authenticated users from sending malicious payloads.
    - Implicit mitigations from Earth Engine: Earth Engine, being a Google-managed service, likely has its own internal mechanisms for input validation and sanitization to protect against various attacks. However, the effectiveness of these implicit mitigations is not guaranteed and should not be solely relied upon.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `region_geojson` parameter within the Cloud Function code. This is crucial to ensure that the GeoJSON input conforms to expected schemas and complexity limits before being processed by Earth Engine. Missing validation includes:
        - Schema validation: Verifying that the provided JSON is a valid GeoJSON object and conforms to the expected structure (e.g., Feature, Polygon, etc.).
        - Complexity limits: Restricting the complexity of geometries, such as the maximum number of vertices in polygons, to prevent resource exhaustion or denial-of-service attempts on Earth Engine.
        - Sanitization: Escaping or filtering potentially harmful characters or properties within the GeoJSON, although the primary risk here is likely related to geometry processing rather than property manipulation in the current code.
- Preconditions:
    - The Cloud Function must be deployed and publicly accessible (although authentication is required).
    - An attacker needs to have valid Google Cloud credentials that allow them to invoke the Cloud Function. This could be compromised credentials or authorized users acting maliciously.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Vulnerable code snippets are found in both `palm_conversion_risk.py` and `palm_presence_risk.py` files:
      ```python
      request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
      region_geojson = request_json['region']
      input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)
      ```
    - **Step-by-step analysis:**
        1. The Cloud Function receives an HTTP request and attempts to parse the JSON body using `request.get_json(silent=True)`. The `silent=True` argument means that if parsing fails, it will return None instead of raising an exception, which is generally good for error handling, but doesn't perform validation.
        2. The code extracts the value associated with the key 'region' from the parsed JSON into the `region_geojson` variable.
        3. Critically, there is no explicit check to validate if `request_json` is not None, if it contains the 'region' key, or if the `region_geojson` value is a valid GeoJSON object.
        4. The `region_geojson` variable, taken directly from the request, is then passed to `ee.Feature(region_geojson)`. The `ee.Feature` constructor from the `earthengine-api` will attempt to interpret the input as a GeoJSON object.
        5. If a malicious or malformed GeoJSON is provided in the 'region' parameter, it is directly passed to Earth Engine for processing without any intermediate validation steps in the Cloud Function code itself.
        6. The subsequent Earth Engine operations (`reduceRegion`) will then operate on the Feature created from the potentially malicious GeoJSON.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `palm_conversion_risk` Cloud Function to Google Cloud Functions following the instructions in `/code/cloud_functions/palm/README.md`.
    2. Ensure that the deployed Cloud Function is configured to require authentication (default setting).
    3. Obtain a valid Google Cloud authentication token. You can use the command `gcloud auth print-identity-token` if you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured.
    4. Prepare a malicious GeoJSON payload. A simple example is a GeoJSON Polygon with an excessively large number of vertices. Create a JSON file named `malicious_geojson.json` with the following content (replace `...` with a very long list of coordinates, e.g., 10000 or more):
       ```json
       {
         "type": "Feature",
         "geometry": {
           "type": "Polygon",
           "coordinates": [[[... large number of coordinates ...]]]
         }
       }
       ```
    5. Send a POST request to the deployed Cloud Function's URL using `curl`. Replace `<CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL>` with the actual URL of your deployed Cloud Function and `<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>` with the token obtained in step 3.
       ```bash
       curl -X POST <CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL> \
           -H "Authorization: bearer <AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>" \
           -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           -d '{
             "region": '"$(cat malicious_geojson.json)"'
           }'
       ```
    6. Observe the response from the Cloud Function. Check for:
        - Increased response time compared to requests with valid, simple GeoJSON.
        - HTTP error codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) indicating that the function failed.
        - Error messages in the response body or in the Cloud Function logs in Google Cloud Console that suggest issues with GeoJSON processing or geometry complexity in Earth Engine.
    7. Further test with different types of malicious GeoJSON payloads, such as:
        - Invalid GeoJSON syntax (e.g., missing commas, incorrect types).
        - GeoJSON with very large coordinate values.
        - GeoJSON with self-intersecting polygons.
        - GeoJSON with a large number of features or properties.
    8. Analyze the results to confirm if these malicious payloads can trigger errors, performance degradation, or unexpected behavior in the Cloud Function or Earth Engine processing, thus validating the GeoJSON Injection vulnerability.
