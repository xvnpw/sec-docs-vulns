### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated GeoJSON input leading to potential Earth Engine processing errors or information disclosure
* Description:
    1. The Cloud Function receives a request with a JSON payload.
    2. The function extracts the value of the `region` key from the JSON payload, which is expected to be a GeoJSON object.
    3. This GeoJSON object, without any validation or sanitization, is directly passed to the `ee.Feature()` constructor from the `earthengine-api` library.
    4. The `ee.Feature()` constructor interprets the provided GeoJSON to define a geographic feature for subsequent geospatial analysis in Google Earth Engine.
    5. If a malicious actor provides a crafted GeoJSON payload, it might be processed by Earth Engine in an unintended way. This could potentially lead to errors in processing, unexpected behavior, or in a worst-case scenario, information disclosure from the Earth Engine backend, depending on how Earth Engine handles malformed or excessively complex GeoJSON inputs. While full code execution is unlikely, unexpected data processing or access control bypass within the Earth Engine environment cannot be fully ruled out without further investigation into Earth Engine's GeoJSON handling.
* Impact:
    - Potential for causing errors in Earth Engine processing, leading to incorrect or incomplete results from the Cloud Function.
    - In a more severe scenario, crafted GeoJSON could potentially be exploited to extract sensitive information from the Earth Engine environment or gain insights into backend processes, though this is less likely without deeper research into Earth Engine's internals.
    - The service might become unreliable or produce unpredictable outputs when processing malicious GeoJSON inputs.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the input GeoJSON without any validation or sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation:** Implement validation of the `region_geojson` within the Cloud Function to ensure it conforms to expected GeoJSON standards and constraints. This should include:
        - **Schema validation:** Verify that the input is a valid GeoJSON object with expected structure (e.g., type, geometry, coordinates).
        - **Complexity limits:**  Impose limits on the complexity of the GeoJSON geometry, such as the number of coordinates in a polygon or the overall size of the GeoJSON object, to prevent excessively large or deeply nested structures that could strain processing resources or trigger unexpected behavior in Earth Engine.
        - **Property sanitization (if properties are used):** If the GeoJSON is expected to contain properties, sanitize or restrict the allowed properties and their values to prevent injection of unexpected data or commands through property fields (though this project doesn't seem to use properties in the vulnerable code).
* Preconditions:
    - The Cloud Function must be deployed and publicly accessible (or accessible to an attacker with valid credentials if authentication is enabled but bypassed).
    - An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the Cloud Function's endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/cloud_functions/palm/palm_conversion_risk.py` and `/code/cloud_functions/palm/palm_presence_risk.py`
    - **Vulnerable code snippet:**
      ```python
      request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
      region_geojson = request_json['region']
      input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)
      ```
    - **Analysis:**
        1. The code retrieves the JSON payload from the HTTP request using `request.get_json(silent=True)`. `silent=True` means it will return `None` if the request data is not valid JSON, but the code doesn't check for `None` and assumes `request_json` is always a valid dictionary if a request is made.
        2. It then extracts the value associated with the key `'region'` from `request_json` and assigns it to `region_geojson`. There's no check if the `'region'` key exists or if its value is actually a GeoJSON object.
        3. Critically, the `region_geojson` variable is directly passed as an argument to `ee.Feature()`.  The `ee.Feature()` constructor from the `earthengine-api` is designed to accept GeoJSON-like structures.  If a malicious GeoJSON is provided, it will be directly processed by Earth Engine without any intermediate validation in the Cloud Function code.
        4. The subsequent Earth Engine operations (`areas.reduceRegion(...)`) will then operate on the feature created from the potentially malicious GeoJSON.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Deploy the `palm_conversion_risk` Cloud Function as described in `/code/cloud_functions/palm/README.md`. Obtain the deployed Cloud Function URL. Ensure you have `gcloud` configured to authenticate requests if authentication is enabled.
    2. **Craft Malicious GeoJSON Payload:** Create a JSON payload with a crafted GeoJSON for the `region` parameter. For example, use a very large GeoJSON polygon. A simple way to create a large polygon is to have many vertices or a very high coordinate precision. As an example, a GeoJSON with an extremely large number of coordinates could be used:
        ```json
        {
          "region": {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
              "type": "Polygon",
              "coordinates": [
                [
                  [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1] /* ... and many more repeated coordinates ... */ ]
                ]
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    3. **Send the Request:** Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the Cloud Function URL with the crafted JSON payload. If authentication is needed, include the authorization header as shown in the README.md.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST <CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL> \
        -H "Authorization: bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '<JSON_PAYLOAD_FROM_STEP_2>'
        ```
    4. **Observe the Response:** Analyze the response from the Cloud Function. Check for:
        - HTTP error codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) indicating a server-side error.
        - Long response times, potentially indicating performance issues due to processing a complex GeoJSON.
        - Any unusual data in the response compared to a normal request with a simple, valid GeoJSON.
    5. **Expected Result:**  A successful attack might result in a server error or a timeout if Earth Engine struggles to process the excessively complex GeoJSON. Even if it doesn't crash, processing time might be significantly increased, indicating a potential vulnerability to resource exhaustion (though DoS is excluded, resource exhaustion leading to incorrect output or long delays within normal operation parameters is still relevant). Further investigation would be needed to determine if more sophisticated crafted GeoJSON payloads could lead to information disclosure or other more critical impacts within the Earth Engine context.  A successful test will demonstrate the lack of input validation and the potential for unexpected behavior when processing unvalidated GeoJSON.
