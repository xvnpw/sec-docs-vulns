### Vulnerabilities Found

* Vulnerability Name: Insufficient GeoJSON Input Validation

* Description:
    1. The Cloud Function receives a GeoJSON geometry as input from the `region` parameter in the JSON request body of a POST request.
    2. The code directly passes this GeoJSON to the `ee.Feature()` constructor from the Earth Engine Python API without any explicit validation within the Cloud Function itself.
    3. If a malicious actor provides a crafted GeoJSON payload that is technically valid GeoJSON but excessively large, complex, or contains unexpected structures, it will be processed by Earth Engine.
    4. This processing of unvalidated, potentially malicious GeoJSON could lead to errors within the Cloud Function, performance degradation in Earth Engine processing, or potentially information disclosure from the Earth Engine backend. While full code execution is unlikely, unexpected data processing or access control bypass within the Earth Engine environment cannot be fully ruled out.
    5. Relying solely on implicit validation by Earth Engine without explicit checks in the Cloud Function introduces risk, as the Cloud Function trusts that the input 'region' is a valid and well-formed GeoJSON without any prior checks.

* Impact:
    - Service disruption: Processing invalid or overly complex GeoJSON can lead to errors in the Cloud Function, causing it to fail and disrupt service availability for legitimate users. The function might become unresponsive, return internal server errors or take a significantly longer time to respond than usual.
    - Potential for incorrect predictions: Malformed or unexpected GeoJSON could be parsed in a way that results in unintended or inaccurate geometries being processed, leading to incorrect risk calculations.
    - Potential for information disclosure: A crafted GeoJSON could potentially be exploited to manipulate Earth Engine queries to access or reveal sensitive data or gain insights into backend processes.
    - Performance degradation within Earth Engine if overly complex or maliciously structured GeoJSON is processed.

* Vulnerability Rank: Medium

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - HTTPS trigger with authentication enforced by default Cloud Function settings. This requires callers to have valid Google Cloud credentials and permissions to invoke the function, which mitigates unauthorized public access to the API endpoint. However, it does not prevent authenticated users from sending malicious payloads by authorized users.
    - Implicit mitigations from Earth Engine: Earth Engine, being a Google-managed service, likely has its own internal mechanisms for input validation and sanitization. However, the effectiveness of these implicit mitigations is not guaranteed and should not be solely relied upon.
    - None in the Cloud Function code itself. The provided code directly uses the input GeoJSON without any explicit validation steps.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - GeoJSON Schema Validation: Implement validation of the input GeoJSON against a defined schema within the Cloud Function. This would ensure that the GeoJSON conforms to the expected structure, data types, and properties before being processed by Earth Engine. Libraries like `jsonschema` in Python can be used for this purpose. Validation should include:
        - Verifying that the input is a valid GeoJSON object with expected structure (e.g., type, geometry, coordinates).
    - GeoJSON Size and Complexity Limits: Implement checks to enforce limits on the size and complexity of the GeoJSON geometry in the Cloud Function. This could include:
        - Limiting the maximum number of coordinates in a geometry.
        - Restricting the complexity of polygons (e.g., number of vertices, nested polygons).
        - Limiting the overall size of the GeoJSON payload.
    - Robust Error Handling: Enhance error handling within the Cloud Function to specifically catch potential exceptions that might arise from invalid GeoJSON inputs or issues during Earth Engine processing. When invalid input is detected, the function should return a clear and informative error message to the user, rather than failing silently or with generic server errors.

* Preconditions:
    - The Cloud Function endpoint must be deployed and accessible to authenticated users who can obtain valid Google Cloud credentials.
    - The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the Cloud Function endpoint with a JSON payload, and have valid Google Cloud credentials to authorize the request.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Vulnerable code exists in both `palm_conversion_risk.py` and `palm_presence_risk.py` files within the `/code/cloud_functions/palm/` directory.
    - The vulnerable code snippet is:
        ```python
        request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
        region_geojson = request_json['region']
        input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)
        ```
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        1. `request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)`: This line attempts to parse the request body as JSON. `silent=True` prevents it from raising an exception if the body is not valid JSON, instead returning `None`. However, the code does not explicitly check if `request_json` is `None`.
        2. `region_geojson = request_json['region']`: This line retrieves the value associated with the 'region' key from the parsed JSON. The code assumes that `request_json` is a valid dictionary and contains the 'region' key, without any explicit checks for the existence of the key.
        3. `input_feature = ee.Feature(region_geojson)`: This is the critical line where the unvalidated `region_geojson` is directly passed to the Earth Engine API. The `ee.Feature()` constructor is expected to handle GeoJSON, but there is no explicit validation of the content, schema, size or structure of `region_geojson` before this point in the Cloud Function code. The function trusts that the input 'region' is a valid and well-formed GeoJSON without any prior checks, making it vulnerable to maliciously crafted GeoJSON payloads.
        4. The subsequent Earth Engine operations (e.g., `areas.reduceRegion(...)`) will then operate on the feature created from the potentially malicious GeoJSON.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Deploy the `palm_conversion_risk` Cloud Function as described in `/code/cloud_functions/palm/README.md`. Obtain the deployed Cloud Function URL. Ensure you have `gcloud` configured and authenticated to make requests.
    2. **Prepare a crafted GeoJSON payload**: Create a JSON file (e.g., `malicious_geojson.json`) containing a GeoJSON object that is designed to be excessively large or complex. For instance, create a Polygon with an extremely high number of vertices (e.g., >100,000 vertices) or deeply nested structures. Example of a very large polygon GeoJSON structure (simplified for brevity):
        ```json
        {
          "region": {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
              "type": "Polygon",
              "coordinates": [
                [
                  [115.707, -3.338], [115.724, -3.338], [115.724, -3.324], ... , [115.707, -3.338]  // Thousands of coordinates here
                ]
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    3. **Send a POST request to the Cloud Function endpoint**: Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the deployed Cloud Function URL. Include the crafted GeoJSON in the request body as the value for the `region` key. Ensure to include the necessary authorization header.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://<cloud_function_url> \
        -H "Authorization: bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$(cat malicious_geojson.json)"
        ```
    4. **Observe the Cloud Function's response**: Check the response from the Cloud Function. If the vulnerability is present, the Cloud Function might:
        - Take a significantly longer time to respond than usual requests.
        - Return an error (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, timeout).
        - Fail to respond at all.
    5. **Examine Cloud Function logs**: Check the logs of the Cloud Function in the Google Cloud Console for any error messages, warnings, or performance degradation indicators that correlate with the time of the test request. Look for timeouts or resource exhaustion errors.
    6. **Expected Result**:  Without input validation, submitting a request with a very complex GeoJSON is expected to either cause a timeout, a server error, or significantly degrade the performance of the Cloud Function. Ideally, with proper validation implemented as missing mitigations, the Cloud Function should reject the request upfront with an informative error message indicating that the provided GeoJSON is too complex or invalid.
