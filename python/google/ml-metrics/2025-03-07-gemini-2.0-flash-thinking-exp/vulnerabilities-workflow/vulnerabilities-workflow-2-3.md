- vulnerability name: Insufficient Numerical Input Validation in Metrics Functions
- description: An attacker could provide specially crafted, out-of-range numerical input to the library's metrics functions. This could occur when an application using this library takes numerical input from external sources (e.g., user input, network data) and passes it directly to the metrics functions without proper validation. By supplying numerical inputs that are outside the expected or reasonable range for a given metric, the attacker can cause the metric calculation to produce incorrect results or trigger runtime errors (e.g., `ValueError`, `OverflowError`, `TypeError`) due to the metric implementation's insufficient handling of such inputs. For example, a metric function might assume input values are always within [0, 1] range, and providing values like -1 or 2 could lead to unexpected behavior.
- impact: The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for incorrect or unreliable metric calculations. Inaccurate metrics can mislead users or downstream machine learning processes that rely on these metrics for decision-making, model evaluation, or monitoring. In some cases, depending on how the library is used and the specific metric implementation, providing out-of-range inputs could also lead to runtime errors, potentially causing instability or unexpected termination of the application using the library. While not a direct compromise of system confidentiality or integrity, the vulnerability undermines the reliability and correctness of the ML-metrics library.
- vulnerability rank: Medium
- currently implemented mitigations: The provided project files do not contain any explicit input validation or sanitization within the Python code of the ml_metrics library itself. The files primarily concern library setup, build processes, and abstract interfaces, lacking concrete implementations of metric functions where input validation would typically be applied. Therefore, based on the provided files, there are no currently implemented mitigations for this vulnerability.
- missing mitigations: Input validation should be implemented within each metric function to ensure that numerical inputs are within the expected and valid range for the specific metric calculation. This validation should include checks for:
    - reasonable minimum and maximum values.
    - correct data types (e.g., integer, float).
    - handling of edge cases (e.g., NaN, infinity, very large or very small numbers).
    - clear error handling or input sanitization to manage out-of-range inputs gracefully, preventing incorrect calculations or runtime errors.
- preconditions:
    - The application uses the ML-metrics library and directly passes numerical input from external or untrusted sources to the library's metric functions.
    - The specific metric function being called lacks sufficient input validation for numerical parameters.
    - An attacker has the ability to control or influence the numerical input data supplied to the application, such as through a user interface, API endpoint, or by manipulating data processed by the application.
- source code analysis:
    - The provided project files consist of setup scripts, configuration files (like `pyproject.toml`), documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`), and interface definitions (e.g., in `/code/ml_metrics/aggregates.py`, `/code/ml_metrics/chainable.py`, `/code/ml_metrics/distributed.py`).
    - There is no code present that implements the actual metric calculation logic (e.g., implementation of precision, recall, F1-score, or custom metrics). The files define abstract classes and interfaces for metrics, aggregation, and distributed computation, but the core metric implementations are missing from these files.
    - Therefore, a direct source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability in metric implementations is not possible with the provided files. The vulnerability is hypothetical and based on the *absence* of input validation in the *intended* metric implementations.
    - To confirm and detail the vulnerability, the source code of actual metric implementations (likely located in files not provided, possibly under `/code/ml_metrics/_src/metrics/` or `/code/ml_metrics/_src/aggregates/`) would need to be examined to verify the lack of numerical input validation.
- security test case:
    - Vulnerability Test Case Name: Numerical Input Validation Bypass in Metric Calculation
    - Description: This test case verifies that the ML-metrics library is vulnerable to incorrect metric calculations or runtime errors when supplied with out-of-range numerical input.
    - Test Steps:
        1. Identify a metric function in the ML-metrics library that is susceptible to numerical input (e.g., assume a hypothetical `precision` function exists and is vulnerable).
        2. Prepare a test input dataset that includes numerical values that are outside the expected valid range for the chosen metric's inputs. For example, if the `precision` metric expects probability scores between 0 and 1, include inputs like -1, 2, or very large numbers.
        3. Call the metric function with the crafted input dataset.
        4. Observe the output of the metric function.
        5. Expected Result:
            - Ideally (if proper validation was in place), the metric function should either:
                - Return an error message indicating invalid input.
                - Sanitize the input and proceed with a valid calculation, or return a special value (e.g., NaN) for cases where calculation is impossible with invalid input.
            - Vulnerable Result (confirming the vulnerability):
                - The metric function calculates and returns an incorrect metric value without indicating any input issue.
                - The metric function throws a runtime error (e.g., `ValueError`, `OverflowError`) due to the out-of-range input, indicating a lack of proper input handling.
        6. Security Test Pass/Fail Criteria:
            - Fail: If the metric function returns an incorrect value or throws a runtime error when provided with out-of-range input, the vulnerability is confirmed.
            - Pass: If the metric function correctly validates the input and either returns an error message, sanitizes the input, or returns a special value to indicate invalid input, the vulnerability is considered mitigated.
    - Note: This test case is conceptual as actual metric implementation code is not provided in PROJECT FILES. A real test case would require targeting a specific implemented metric function and crafting inputs relevant to that function's expected numerical parameters.
