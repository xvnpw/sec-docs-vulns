- Vulnerability Name: Improper Input Validation in Metric Calculation Functions

- Description:
    1. The ML-metrics library calculates various machine learning metrics based on user-provided input data (e.g., predictions, labels, text).
    2. Metric calculation functions within the library might lack proper input validation.
    3. An attacker could provide maliciously crafted input data to these metric functions.
    4. This malicious input could be designed to be outside of the expected range, type, or format.
    5. If input validation is insufficient or missing, the metric calculation functions may process this malicious input without proper sanitization or error handling.
    6. This could lead to unexpected behavior such as incorrect metric calculations, exceptions, or potentially other security issues depending on how the library is used in a larger application.

- Impact:
    - Incorrect Metric Calculation: Malicious input could lead to the calculation of inaccurate or misleading metrics, affecting the reliability of evaluations and potentially leading to flawed decision-making based on these metrics.
    - Unexpected Behavior: Improperly handled input could cause the metric functions to behave unexpectedly, potentially crashing the application using the library or leading to unpredictable states.
    - Potential Security Issues: While not immediately evident from the provided files, depending on the nature of the input validation flaws and how the library is used, more severe security issues could theoretically arise in applications that rely on ML-metrics if vulnerabilities are exploitable.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided files, there are no specific input validation mitigations visible in the setup scripts, build scripts, or general library structure. The code includes type hints and copyright notices, but these are not direct mitigations for input validation vulnerabilities.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation should be implemented within the metric calculation functions to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected formats, types, and ranges.
    - Error handling should be robust to gracefully manage invalid input and prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Consider using input sanitization techniques to neutralize potentially malicious input before processing.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to provide input data to an application that utilizes the ML-metrics library to calculate metrics. This is generally the case in ML evaluation pipelines where users can control or influence the data being evaluated.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - Due to the limited project files provided, a detailed source code analysis of the metric calculation functions (located in `ml_metrics/_src/`) is not possible.
    - To perform a complete source code analysis, the following files (and potentially others under `_src/`) would need to be reviewed:
        - `/code/ml_metrics/_src/aggregates/classification.py`
        - `/code/ml_metrics/_src/aggregates/rolling_stats.py`
        - `/code/ml_metrics/_src/aggregates/retrieval.py`
        - `/code/ml_metrics/_src/aggregates/text.py`
    - The analysis should focus on how input data (`y_true`, `y_pred`, text strings, numerical batches, etc.) is processed within each metric function.
    - Look for areas where:
        - Input types are not strictly checked.
        - Input values are not range-checked (e.g., negative values where only positive are expected, excessively large numbers).
        - Division operations are performed without checking for division by zero.
        - String inputs are processed without proper sanitization against injection attacks (though less relevant for numerical metrics, more so for text-based metrics).
    - Without the source code, visualization or further detailed walkthrough is not feasible.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Identify a metric calculation function within the ML-metrics library (e.g., `precision` from `ml_metrics.metrics.classification`).
    2. Design a series of test inputs for this function that include:
        - Valid input data within the expected range and type.
        - Invalid input data:
            - Incorrect data type (e.g., string instead of numerical array).
            - Out-of-range values (e.g., negative probabilities, very large numbers).
            - Unexpected data formats (e.g., NaN, Inf values in numerical arrays).
            - For text metrics, inputs containing special characters or very long strings.
    3. Execute the metric function with both valid and invalid inputs.
    4. Observe the behavior of the function:
        - For valid inputs, ensure the metric is calculated correctly.
        - For invalid inputs:
            - Check if the function raises appropriate exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).
            - If no exceptions are raised, verify if the function returns reasonable or safe default values instead of producing incorrect or unexpected results.
            - Importantly, ensure that invalid inputs do not cause crashes, hangs, or other exploitable behavior.
    5. If the function does not handle invalid inputs robustly (i.e., doesn't raise exceptions or returns incorrect/unexpected values without warning), this confirms the presence of an input validation vulnerability.
