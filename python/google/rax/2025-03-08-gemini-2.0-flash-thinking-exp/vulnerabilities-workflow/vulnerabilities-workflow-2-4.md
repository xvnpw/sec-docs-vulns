## Vulnerability List

There are no vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that match the specified criteria.

Based on the project files and the vulnerability description context, the potential vulnerability lies in systems that *use* the Rax library without proper input sanitization, rather than within the Rax library itself. The provided files only contain the Rax library source code, documentation, examples, and configuration files, and do not represent a complete system that takes external input and uses Rax for ranking.

Therefore, according to the instructions to only include valid vulnerabilities that are part of attack vector and introduced by project from PROJECT FILES, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
