## Vulnerabilities

### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `next` parameter

**Description:**
An attacker can exploit a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL targeting the application's sign-in endpoint. This URL includes a `next` parameter containing Javascript code. If the application insufficiently sanitizes or escapes this `next` parameter when constructing the redirection URL after successful login, the malicious Javascript code will be reflected back to the user's browser and executed. This occurs when the application redirects the user to the URL specified in the `next` parameter after successful authentication.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to various malicious actions, including:
1. **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user's session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
2. **Account Takeover:** If combined with other vulnerabilities or weaknesses, it could potentially lead to account takeover.
3. **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
4. **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites that can install malware on their systems.
5. **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page displayed to the user.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:**
None explicitly mentioned in the provided description or initial analysis. The initial analysis mentions `django.utils.http.is_safe_url` and `HttpResponseRedirect` as potential mitigations, but does not confirm if they are effectively preventing this specific XSS.

**Missing mitigations:**
1. **Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The application should properly sanitize or escape the `next` parameter before including it in the redirection URL. This could involve:
    - **URL Encoding:** Ensuring the `next` parameter is properly URL encoded when constructing the redirect URL. While `HttpResponseRedirect` generally handles URL encoding, the vulnerability description suggests insufficient handling *before* redirection.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS, but is not a primary mitigation against the vulnerability itself.
    - **Input Validation:** While `is_safe_url` is used, it primarily focuses on preventing open redirects. More robust input validation should be implemented to specifically check for and remove or escape potentially malicious Javascript code within the `next` parameter.

**Preconditions:**
1. The application must use the `next` parameter to handle redirection after successful login.
2. The application must not sufficiently sanitize or escape the `next` parameter before using it in the redirection URL.
3. The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious Javascript payload in the `next` parameter and convince a user to click on it or access it.

**Source code analysis:**
To confirm this vulnerability, a source code analysis would be needed to examine the following:
1. **Signin View Code:** Identify the Django view responsible for handling the sign-in process and redirection after login.
2. **`next` Parameter Handling:** Check how the `next` parameter is retrieved from the request (e.g., `request.GET.get('next')`).
3. **Redirection URL Construction:** Analyze how the redirection URL is constructed. Specifically, check if the `next` parameter is directly embedded into the URL string without proper escaping or sanitization before being used in `HttpResponseRedirect`.

**Example vulnerable code scenario (Illustrative - Requires actual code inspection):**

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.utils.http import is_safe_url

def signin_view(request):
    next_url = request.GET.get('next')
    if next_url:
        if is_safe_url(url=next_url, allowed_hosts=request.get_host()):
            # Potentially vulnerable if next_url is not further escaped before redirection
            redirect_url = next_url
            return HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_url)
        else:
            return HttpResponse("Unsafe redirect URL")
    else:
        return HttpResponse("No next URL provided")
```

In this illustrative (and potentially oversimplified) example, if `redirect_url = next_url` is used directly in `HttpResponseRedirect` without ensuring `next_url` content is properly escaped specifically for URL context after the `is_safe_url` check (which primarily validates the host and scheme), it *could* be vulnerable to XSS if `next_url` contains malicious Javascript.  While `HttpResponseRedirect` performs URL encoding, the point of vulnerability might be if there's an earlier step where the URL is constructed in a way that bypasses this encoding or if the encoding is insufficient for certain XSS payloads.

**Security test case:**
1. **Craft Malicious URL:** Create a URL to the sign-in endpoint with a `next` parameter containing a Javascript payload. For example:
   `https://<application_url>/signin/?next=javascript:alert('XSS')`
   or
   `https://<application_url>/signin/?next=/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E` (URL encoded payload)

2. **Access the Malicious URL:**  As an external attacker, access the crafted URL in a web browser.

3. **Login (Simulate Successful Authentication):** Complete the sign-in process as a valid user. If the application redirects after successful login using the `next` parameter, proceed.

4. **Observe Redirection and Javascript Execution:** After successful login, observe if the browser redirects to a URL that includes the malicious Javascript payload. Check if the Javascript code (e.g., `alert('XSS')`) is executed in the browser.

5. **Verify XSS:** If the Javascript code is executed (e.g., an alert box appears), it confirms the reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Expected Result of Test Case:** If the application is vulnerable, accessing the crafted URL and completing the login process will result in the Javascript code from the `next` parameter being executed in the user's browser, typically displaying an alert box. If the application is not vulnerable, the Javascript code will not be executed, and the user will be redirected to a safe URL (or the intended redirect target if it was a legitimate URL with malicious Javascript injected).

### SAML Response Signature Bypass due to Missing Signature Requirement Configuration

**Description:**
1. An attacker intercepts a valid SAML response.
2. The attacker modifies the SAML response, for example, changing user attributes to gain elevated privileges.
3. The attacker sends the modified SAML response to the application's ACS endpoint.
4. If the Django SAML2 Auth library is not configured to require SAML response signatures (`WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` or `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` set to False), the library will not verify the signature of the SAML response.
5. The application processes the modified SAML response as valid, potentially granting unauthorized access or privileges to the attacker based on the manipulated attributes.

**Impact:**
- High: Unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionalities. An attacker can potentially impersonate any user, including administrators, by forging SAML responses. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:**
- The code defaults `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` and `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` to `True` in `get_saml_client` function within `django_saml2_auth/saml.py`. This is a good security default.
- The documentation in `README.md` mentions these settings and their importance, implicitly encouraging users to keep signature verification enabled.

**Missing mitigations:**
- There is no explicit check in the code to ensure that `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` or `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` are actually set to `True` in the user's `settings.py`. The application relies on the default values if these settings are not explicitly defined.
- No warning or error is raised if the user explicitly sets `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` or `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` to `False` in their settings, which could lead to misconfiguration and security vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept SAML responses, which is possible in various network scenarios, especially if TLS is not properly enforced or if the attacker is on the same network as the user.
- The Django SAML2 Auth library must be configured with `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` or `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` set to `False` in the Django project's `settings.py` or relying on default (and assuming default is insecure). If the user explicitly sets these to False or does not configure them and assumes default is secure but the default is actually insecure then vulnerability exists. However, in this code, default is secure (`True`). If user explicitly disables it, then vulnerability exists.

**Source code analysis:**
1. In `django_saml2_auth/saml.py`, the `get_saml_client` function configures the `pysaml2` client.
2. Within the `saml_settings['service']['sp']` dictionary, the options `want_assertions_signed` and `want_response_signed` are set based on Django settings:
    ```python
    "want_assertions_signed": dictor(
        saml2_auth_settings, "WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED", default=True
    ),
    "want_response_signed": dictor(
        saml2_auth_settings, "WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED", default=True
    ),
    ```
3. The `dictor` function with `default=True` ensures that if these settings are not defined in `settings.SAML2_AUTH`, they default to `True`, which is secure.
4. However, if a user explicitly sets these values to `False` in their `settings.py`, signature verification will be disabled.
5. In `django_saml2_auth/views.py`, the `acs` view calls `decode_saml_response` to process the SAML response. If signature verification is disabled through configuration, this function will not effectively validate the authenticity and integrity of the SAML response beyond basic XML parsing and schema validation (done by `pysaml2` library, but signature verification is a separate step that can be disabled).
6. The vulnerability lies in the possibility of misconfiguration. If an administrator mistakenly sets `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED` or `WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED` to `False` (or believes the default is `False` and does not explicitly enable signature verification, though the default is actually secure in this code), the application becomes vulnerable to SAML response manipulation attacks.

**Security test case:**
1. **Setup:** Configure a Django application using `django-saml2-auth`. In `settings.py` within `SAML2_AUTH` dictionary, explicitly set `WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED = False`. Configure a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) to send SAML responses to this application.
2. **Capture Valid SAML Response:** Authenticate as a legitimate user against the IdP and capture a valid SAML response using a tool like SAML-tracer.
3. **Modify SAML Response:** Modify the captured SAML response XML. For example, change the user's email address or add an attribute that grants admin privileges (if attribute mapping is configured to use such attributes for authorization). Remove or invalidate the original signature from the SAML Response, as the application is configured to not verify it.
4. **Send Modified SAML Response:** Submit the modified SAML response to the application's ACS endpoint (e.g., `/sso/acs/`).
5. **Verify Bypass:** Check if the application logs the user in based on the modified attributes in the forged SAML response. If the application grants access or privileges based on the manipulated response without signature verification, the vulnerability is confirmed. For example, check if you are logged in as the user specified in the modified SAML response, or if you have gained admin privileges if you added an admin attribute.
