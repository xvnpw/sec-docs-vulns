- Vulnerability Name: Potential Exposure of Loki Password in Logs
- Description:
    1. The Azure Function retrieves the `LOKI_PASSWORD` from environment variables.
    2. This password is used to authenticate with the Grafana Loki instance.
    3. In the `function_app.py`, within the `logexport` function, a `try-except` block is used to handle potential exceptions during the log pushing process to Loki.
    4. If an exception occurs during `loki_client.push(streams)`, the code enters the `except` block.
    5. Inside the `except` block, `logging.exception` is used to log the exception details.
    6. Depending on the nature of the exception and the logging configuration, the `LOKI_PASSWORD` could potentially be included in the logged exception information. This could happen if the exception context inadvertently includes the password or if underlying libraries like the `requests` library (used in `LokiClient`) log sensitive information such as authorization headers when an error occurs.
    7. If an attacker gains access to the Azure Function logs (e.g., through misconfigured Azure Monitor access controls or other vulnerabilities), they could potentially extract the `LOKI_PASSWORD` from the logs if it was exposed during an error.

- Impact:
    - If the `LOKI_PASSWORD` is exposed in the logs and accessed by an attacker, they could gain unauthorized access to the Grafana Loki instance.
    - This would allow the attacker to read sensitive logs stored in Loki, potentially leading to further security breaches or information disclosure.
    - The attacker could also potentially manipulate or delete logs in Loki, depending on the permissions associated with the exposed password.

- Vulnerability rank: Medium
    - The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by external attackers without access to Azure Function logs.
    - However, if an attacker gains access to the logs through other means, the impact could be significant.
    - The likelihood of the password being logged depends on error conditions and logging configurations, making it a medium severity issue.

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no explicit mitigations in the provided code to prevent the logging of the `LOKI_PASSWORD` in exception scenarios.
    - The code uses environment variables, which is a standard practice for configuration, but doesn't include specific safeguards against password logging.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Secure Logging Practices**: Implement secure logging practices to prevent sensitive information like passwords from being logged, especially in exception handling. This could involve:
        - Avoiding logging the full exception context when handling errors related to authentication or sensitive operations.
        - Sanitizing log messages to remove potentially sensitive data before logging.
        - Using structured logging and carefully controlling what data is included in log messages.
    - **Secrets Management**: Consider using Azure Key Vault or other secrets management solutions to store and retrieve the `LOKI_PASSWORD` instead of directly using environment variables. This can provide better control and auditing of access to sensitive credentials.
    - **Review and Harden Logging Configuration**: Review the logging configuration of the Azure Function and any underlying libraries (like `requests`) to ensure that sensitive headers or parameters are not inadvertently logged. Configure logging levels appropriately to minimize verbose logging in production environments.

- Preconditions:
    - An error must occur during the execution of `loki_client.push(streams)` in the `logexport` function. This could be due to network issues, incorrect Loki endpoint, authentication failures (ironically), or other problems during log transmission.
    - Logging must be configured at a level that captures exception details (e.g., Information, Debug, or Error levels in Azure Function logging).
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Azure Function logs, for example, through compromised Azure credentials, misconfigured Azure Monitor access, or other vulnerabilities in the Azure environment.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/function_app.py`
    ```python
    @app.function_name(name=os.getenv(FUNCTION_NAME_VAR, default="logexport"))
    @app.event_hub_message_trigger(
        # ...
    )
    @app.retry(
        # ...
    )
    def logexport(events: List[func.EventHubEvent], context: func.Context) -> None:
        try:
            # ...
            loki_client.push(streams)
        except Exception:
            if context.retry_context.retry_count == context.retry_context.max_retry_count:
                logging.exception(
                    "failed to process event %d times. Giving up.",
                    context.retry_context.retry_count + 1,
                )
            else:
                logging.exception(
                    "failed to process event %d times. Retrying...",
                    context.retry_context.retry_count + 1,
                )
                raise
    ```
    - The `logging.exception` call within the `except` block in `function_app.py` is the point where the vulnerability can be triggered. `logging.exception` is designed to log an error message and include exception information, which, under certain circumstances, could include the `LOKI_PASSWORD`.
    - File: `/code/logexport/loki/client.py`
    ```python
    class LokiClient:
        # ...
        def __init__(
            self, url: str, username: str | None = None, password: str | None = None
        ):
            # ...
            if username is not None and password is not None:
                self.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
            else:
                self.auth = None

        def push(self, streams: Iterable[push_pb2.StreamAdapter]):
            # ...
            req = Request(
                "POST",
                # ...
            )
            if self.auth is not None:
                req.auth = self.auth
            res = requests.Session().send(req.prepare())
            if 400 <= res.status_code < 500:
                raise HTTPError(
                    f"{res.status_code} Client Error for url: {res.url}: {res.text}"
                )
            elif 500 <= res.status_code < 600:
                raise HTTPError(
                    f"{res.status_code} Server Error for url: {res.url}: {res.text}"
                )
    ```
    - The `LokiClient` uses the provided password to set up HTTP Basic Authentication. When `requests.Session().send(req.prepare())` is called, especially when an error occurs, the `requests` library or underlying network libraries might log details about the request, including headers, depending on the logging configuration. If detailed logging is enabled, the `Authorization` header containing the password could be logged.

- Security test case:
    1. **Prerequisites**: You need to have the Azure Function deployed and configured, and have access to Azure Function logs (e.g., through Azure portal or Azure CLI). You will also need to be able to modify the `LOKI_ENDPOINT` environment variable for testing purposes.
    2. **Modify Loki Endpoint**: In the Azure Function configuration, set the `LOKI_ENDPOINT` environment variable to an invalid or non-existent URL (e.g., `http://invalid-loki-endpoint:3100`). This will intentionally cause the `loki_client.push()` call to fail and trigger an exception.
    3. **Configure Logging Level**: Ensure that the Azure Function's logging level is set to "Information" or a more verbose level that captures exception details. You can configure this in the Azure Function's "App settings" under "Function app settings" or through the Azure portal's "Monitoring" section for the Function App.
    4. **Trigger the Function**: Send events to the Azure Event Hub that triggers the Azure Function. This will cause the function to attempt to push logs to the invalid Loki endpoint, resulting in an exception.
    5. **Examine Azure Function Logs**: Access and examine the Azure Function logs. You can typically do this through the Azure portal by navigating to the Function App, then "Monitor" -> "Logs". Search through the logs generated during the test execution.
    6. **Search for Password**: Look for any log entries that contain the `LOKI_PASSWORD` or the actual password value. Pay attention to log entries generated by the `logging.exception` calls within the `logexport` function, especially those related to connection errors or authentication failures when pushing to Loki.
    7. **Verification**: If you find the `LOKI_PASSWORD` or its value in the Azure Function logs, the vulnerability is confirmed. The logs would demonstrate that under error conditions, the password could be inadvertently logged, making it potentially accessible to anyone who can access the Azure Function logs.
