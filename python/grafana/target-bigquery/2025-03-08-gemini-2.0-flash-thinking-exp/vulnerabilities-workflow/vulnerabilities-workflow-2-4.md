- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Service Account Credentials in Configuration Files
- Description:
    1. The `target-bigquery` project relies on service account credentials stored in a `client_secrets.json` file for authentication with Google BigQuery.
    2. The README.md provides instructions to download this file and suggests placing it in the working directory or providing a path to it.
    3. It also instructs users to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to this file.
    4. Storing service account credentials directly in a JSON file (`client_secrets.json`) within the project directory or referenced by an environment variable without proper access controls increases the risk of unauthorized access if the configuration files or the environment are compromised.
    5. If an attacker gains access to the machine or environment where `target-bigquery` is running, they could potentially retrieve the `client_secrets.json` file or access the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
    6. With these credentials, the attacker can impersonate the service account and gain unauthorized access to the associated Google BigQuery project.
- Impact:
    - High.
    - Unauthorized access to the Google BigQuery project associated with the compromised service account.
    - An attacker could read, modify, or delete data within the BigQuery project, leading to data breaches, data corruption, or data loss.
    - Potential for further escalation of privileges within the compromised GCP project depending on the service account permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files. The documentation mentions using a service account, but does not provide secure storage guidance.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement and document best practices for secure storage of service account credentials, such as using Google Cloud Secret Manager, environment secrets in deployment platforms, or other secure vault solutions instead of storing them directly in files or environment variables without restricted access.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Reinforce in documentation the importance of granting the service account only the minimal necessary BigQuery permissions (BigQuery Data Editor and BigQuery Job User as mentioned are reasonable starting points, but should be reviewed based on specific use case).
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly related to credential storage, robust input validation and sanitization throughout the application can limit the impact of potential compromises by preventing injection attacks that might leverage compromised credentials.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker gains access to the system or environment where `target-bigquery` is deployed or configured, including access to files or environment variables.
    - The user has followed the documentation and stored the service account credentials in a `client_secrets.json` file or via the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not contain the Python code for `target-bigquery` itself, so a direct source code analysis of credential loading is not possible from these files alone.
    - However, the `README.md` file explicitly instructs users to download `client_secrets.json` and set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, which is an insecure practice if not handled carefully.
    - The `README.md` (Step 2: Authenticate with a service account) guides users to create a service account and download the credentials as `client_secrets.json`.
    - Step 7 in the README instructs users to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to the downloaded `client_secrets.json` file.
    - The vulnerability is not in the provided code, but in the insecure instructions in `README.md` which guides users to store credentials insecurely.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Precondition: Assume you have successfully set up `target-bigquery` locally following the README instructions, including downloading `client_secrets.json` and setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
    2. Access Credentials: As an attacker, gain access to the system where `target-bigquery` is set up. This could be through various means like exploiting a separate vulnerability, social engineering, or insider access.
    3. Retrieve Credentials File: Locate and copy the `client_secrets.json` file from the directory where `target-bigquery` is configured to run, or access the value of the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
    4. Authenticate to BigQuery: Using the retrieved `client_secrets.json` or its content, authenticate to Google BigQuery using the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) or BigQuery client libraries from a different machine or context, impersonating the service account.
        Example using `gcloud`:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/path/to/client_secrets.json
        bq ls <project_id>:<dataset_id>
        ```
    5. Verify Unauthorized Access: Successfully list BigQuery datasets or perform other BigQuery actions, confirming unauthorized access using the compromised credentials.
    6. Impact Demonstration (Optional but Recommended):  As the attacker, perform a destructive action like deleting a test BigQuery table to showcase the potential impact of the vulnerability.
