- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Credential Handling via Environment Variable

- **Description:**
    1. The `target-bigquery` project, as documented in `README.md`, relies on users setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the service account's JSON key file (`client_secrets.json`).
    2. The application code likely uses this environment variable to authenticate with Google BigQuery, following standard Google Cloud SDK practices.
    3. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the environment where `target-bigquery` is running (e.g., compromised server, container escape, insider threat, or through other vulnerabilities in the deployment environment), they can potentially read the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
    4. With access to this environment variable, the attacker effectively obtains the path to the service account key file.
    5. By using this path or the key file itself, the attacker can then impersonate the service account and gain unauthorized access to the connected BigQuery project.
    6. This unauthorized access allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the BigQuery project, depending on the permissions granted to the compromised service account (as configured in Step 2 of the README.md).

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Google BigQuery project associated with the service account.
    - This can lead to:
        - **Data Breach:** Exfiltration of sensitive data stored in BigQuery.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data within BigQuery, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
        - **Resource Abuse:** Usage of compromised BigQuery resources for malicious purposes, potentially incurring unexpected costs.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The project itself does not implement any specific code-level mitigations for insecure credential handling via environment variables. The `README.md` only documents the required setup steps, including setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and granting necessary BigQuery permissions to the service account.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Credential Storage Documentation:** The documentation (`README.md`) should strongly emphasize the security risks associated with storing service account keys in environment variables and recommend more secure alternatives.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While mentioned in the README, it should be further emphasized to grant the service account only the minimal necessary BigQuery permissions (`BigQuery Data Editor` and `BigQuery Job User` as minimally recommended) to limit the impact of potential credential compromise.
    - **Alternative Authentication Methods:** Explore and document more secure authentication methods beyond environment variables, such as:
        - **Workload Identity:** For deployments within Google Cloud, using Workload Identity eliminates the need to manage service account keys directly.
        - **Secret Management Services:** Recommend using dedicated secret management services (like Google Cloud Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.) to store and retrieve credentials securely instead of environment variables.
        - **Credential Rotation:** Advise users to regularly rotate service account keys to minimize the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Service Account Key Usage:** The target-bigquery instance must be configured to authenticate using a service account JSON key file as described in the README.md.
    - **Environment Access:** An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the environment (server, container, etc.) where the `target-bigquery` application is running and be able to read environment variables.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Based on the provided code, there is no explicit code for handling service account credentials within these files.
    - It is highly probable that `target-bigquery` relies on standard Google Cloud client libraries for authentication. These libraries typically check for the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and automatically use the key file specified in it for authentication.
    - **No Custom Credential Handling:** The provided code doesn't show any custom logic for loading, storing, or securing the service account credentials. The vulnerability stems from the inherent insecurity of environment variable-based credential storage and the lack of explicit mitigations within the project.
    - **Implicit Credential Loading:** The vulnerability is implicitly introduced by the project's reliance on standard Google Cloud authentication methods that depend on environment variables, without providing guidance or implementing more secure alternatives.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup target-bigquery:** Deploy `target-bigquery` in a test environment and configure it to use a service account JSON key file by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
    2. **Simulate Environment Access:** Gain access to the environment where `target-bigquery` is running (this step simulates an attacker gaining access; in a real-world scenario, this could be through various attack vectors).
    3. **Read Environment Variable:** From within the compromised environment, read the value of the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. This will reveal the path to the service account key file.
    4. **Impersonate Service Account:** Using Google Cloud SDK (e.g., `gcloud`) or BigQuery client libraries from a separate machine (representing the attacker's machine), authenticate using the service account key file obtained in the previous step.
    5. **Verify Unauthorized Access:** Attempt to perform actions in BigQuery using the compromised service account credentials, such as:
        - Listing datasets in the project.
        - Reading data from existing BigQuery tables.
        - Creating new tables or datasets.
        - Modifying or deleting existing data (if the service account has sufficient permissions).
    6. **Expected Result:** The attacker should be able to successfully impersonate the service account and perform unauthorized BigQuery operations, demonstrating the vulnerability.
