## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical security vulnerabilities identified in the provided monitoring stack setup. These vulnerabilities expose sensitive monitoring data and allow for potential disruption of the monitoring system and data exfiltration.

### 1. Unauthenticated Grafana Alloy Reload API Endpoint

- **Description:**
    1. The Grafana Alloy HTTP server is exposed on port `12345` as defined in `docker-compose.yml` without any authentication configured by default.
    2. The `/reload` endpoint of the Grafana Alloy API is accessible over HTTP on the exposed port. This endpoint is intended for administrators to dynamically reload the Alloy configuration without restarting the service.
    3. An attacker can send a POST request to the `/reload` endpoint without providing any authentication credentials.
    4. Upon receiving an unauthenticated reload request, Grafana Alloy will attempt to reload its configuration from the mounted `config.alloy` file.
    5. By replacing the legitimate `config.alloy` file with a malicious one (or crafting a malicious configuration and sending it directly in the request body), an attacker can inject arbitrary configurations into the running Grafana Alloy instance by triggering the reload API.
    6. This malicious configuration can be crafted to:
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data by modifying Alloy to send collected metrics and logs to an attacker-controlled endpoint.
        - Disrupt monitoring by altering or disabling metric and log collection pipelines.
        - Potentially gain further access to monitored systems depending on the Alloy configuration and integrated components.

- **Impact:**
    - **Configuration Injection:** An attacker can inject a malicious Grafana Alloy configuration, gaining full control over Alloy's monitoring behavior.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data being monitored by Alloy (e.g., container metrics, logs) can be exfiltrated to an attacker's server by manipulating the Alloy configuration to forward data. This can include application logs and system metrics, potentially revealing sensitive information about the monitored environment.
    - **Monitoring Disruption:** The attacker can disrupt the monitoring system by altering or disabling metric and log collection, leading to blind spots and potentially masking malicious activities within the monitored environment. This can severely impact observability and incident response capabilities.
    - **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the Alloy configuration and the extent of integrations, a successful configuration injection could be a stepping stone to further compromise of the monitored systems. For instance, if Alloy is configured to interact with other services or has access to sensitive credentials, these could be exploited via configuration injection.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided project files and default setup do not include any authentication or access control mechanisms for the Grafana Alloy HTTP API or the `/reload` endpoint. The default configuration explicitly exposes the API without any security measures.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Grafana Alloy's HTTP API, especially sensitive endpoints like `/reload`, must be protected by authentication and authorization. Options include:
        - Basic Authentication
        - API Keys
        - Mutual TLS (mTLS)
        - OAuth 2.0
        Implement role-based access control to restrict who can reload the Alloy configuration, ensuring only authorized administrators can perform this action.
    - **Network Restrictions:** Restrict network access to the Alloy UI port (12345) to only trusted networks or administrators. This can be achieved using firewalls or network policies to limit access from the public internet or untrusted networks.  Consider making the Alloy API only accessible from within a private network or through a VPN.
    - **Secure Default Configuration:** The default `config.alloy` (or guidance for creating one) should emphasize the importance of securing the reload API and provide configuration examples for authentication. The documentation should clearly highlight the security risks of leaving the reload API unauthenticated.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While authentication is the primary mitigation, input validation on the reloaded configuration could provide a defense-in-depth measure to prevent the injection of completely invalid or obviously malicious configurations. However, this should not be considered a substitute for proper authentication.
    - **Documentation and Warnings:** Clearly document the security implications of exposing the reload API without authentication and provide explicit warnings in the workshop materials and deployment guides.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Grafana Alloy is deployed using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file, which exposes port `12345` to the host.
    - No custom `config.alloy` is provided that explicitly configures authentication for the HTTP API.
    - The network port `12345` on the host running Grafana Alloy is reachable by the attacker. This could be due to direct public exposure, misconfigured firewalls, or internal network access.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`docker-compose.yml`**: The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the deployment of Grafana Alloy and exposes port `12345` on the host to port `12345` of the Alloy container:
        ```yaml
        ports:
          - 12345:12345
        ```
        This makes the Grafana Alloy HTTP API accessible from outside the Docker environment if the host machine's firewall allows traffic on port `12345`.
    2. **`docker-compose.yml`**: The command used to start Grafana Alloy includes `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`:
        ```yaml
        command: run --server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345 ... /etc/alloy/config.alloy
        ```
        This explicitly binds the Alloy HTTP server to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port `12345`, confirming its external accessibility from any reachable network.
    3. **`README.md`**: The `README.md` provides instructions on how to reload the Grafana Alloy configuration using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/-/reload
        ```
        This command, as provided, does not include any authentication headers or parameters, suggesting that the reload API is intended to be used without authentication in the workshop's default configuration.
    4. **Absence of Authentication Configuration**:  Neither the `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`, nor any provided configuration files include any settings or instructions to enable authentication for the Grafana Alloy HTTP API.  The default behavior of Grafana Alloy is to expose the HTTP API without authentication unless explicitly configured otherwise.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy the Workshop Stack**: Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `/code` directory to start the Grafana Alloy, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana stack.
    2. **Access Grafana Alloy UI**: Verify that the Grafana Alloy UI is accessible by navigating to `http://localhost:12345` in a web browser. This confirms that the HTTP server is running and accessible on the exposed port.
    3. **Attempt Unauthenticated Reload**: Send a POST request to the Grafana Alloy reload API endpoint using `curl` from the host machine or any machine that can reach the host on port `12345`:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/-/reload
        ```
    4. **Verify Successful Reload (No Authentication Required)**:
        - The `curl` command will return an HTTP 200 status code or a similar success response from the Grafana Alloy API, indicating successful reload without authentication.
        - Check the Grafana Alloy container logs (using `docker logs alloy`) for messages indicating that the configuration was reloaded successfully and confirming no authentication errors occurred.
    5. **Inject Malicious Configuration (Validation)**:
        - Create a file named `malicious_config.alloy` with content designed to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled endpoint (e.g., using `remote.http` to send data to `http://attacker.example.com:3100/loki/api/v1/push`).
        - Replace the original `config.alloy` file mounted into the Grafana Alloy container with `malicious_config.alloy`.
        - Repeat step 3: `curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/-/reload`.
        - Observe network traffic to `attacker.example.com:3100` to verify data exfiltration or check Alloy logs for errors and confirmation of the new configuration being loaded.

This test case definitively proves that the Grafana Alloy reload API is accessible without authentication in the default setup, allowing for configuration injection and the severe impacts associated with it.

### 2. Unauthenticated Access to Monitoring Stack Components

- **Description:**
    1. The Docker Compose configuration provided for the workshop deploys Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, and Alloy without any authentication enabled by default.
    2. By deploying the stack and accessing the exposed ports for each component (Grafana: 3000, Loki: 3100, Prometheus: 9090, Alloy: 12345), an attacker can gain full access to the UIs and APIs of these services without providing any credentials.
    3. Specifically, accessing the Grafana UI at `http://<host>:3000`, Loki API at `http://<host>:3100`, Prometheus UI at `http://<host>:9090`, and Alloy UI at `http://<host>:12345` reveals that these interfaces are publicly accessible without any login requirements.
    4. Furthermore, Grafana is configured with anonymous admin access enabled, granting extensive privileges to any unauthenticated user accessing the Grafana UI.

- **Impact:**
    - **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can gain complete access to monitoring dashboards in Grafana, allowing them to view metrics, logs, and potentially other sensitive information collected by the monitoring stack. This includes application performance data, system metrics, and logs that may contain sensitive business or technical details.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Monitoring data can contain sensitive information about the application, infrastructure, and user activity. Unauthenticated access leads to significant information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks.
    - **Grafana Admin Access:** Grafana is configured with `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin`, granting anonymous users administrator privileges. This allows attackers to modify dashboards, data sources, alerts, and user settings within Grafana, potentially disrupting monitoring operations, manipulating data visualization, or using Grafana as a pivot point for further attacks by adding malicious plugins or data sources.
    - **Loki and Prometheus Data Access:** Unauthenticated access to Loki and Prometheus allows attackers to directly query logs and metrics. This can be used to gather detailed information about system performance, errors, and security-related events, potentially uncovering vulnerabilities or sensitive operational details.
    - **Alloy UI Access:** Unauthenticated access to Alloy UI exposes the configuration and operational status of the Alloy agent. This can be leveraged to understand the monitoring setup, identify potential weaknesses, and potentially manipulate the monitoring configuration if other vulnerabilities are present (like the reload API vulnerability).

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided Docker Compose and configuration files do not implement any authentication or access control mechanisms for Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, or Alloy UI. The default configurations are explicitly set to disable or bypass authentication in some cases (e.g., Grafana anonymous access, Loki authentication disabled).

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Enable Authentication for Grafana:** Configure Grafana to require authentication. Disable anonymous access by setting `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false` and enable basic authentication (`GF_AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED=true`) or integrate with an external authentication provider (like OAuth 2.0, LDAP, or SAML).  Implement proper user and role management within Grafana.
    - **Implement Authentication and Authorization for Loki:** Configure Loki to enable authentication by setting `auth_enabled: true` and configuring an appropriate authentication mechanism. This can be done using various methods like HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0, or mTLS. Implement authorization policies to control access to log streams, ensuring only authorized users or services can read and write logs.
    - **Implement Authentication and Authorization for Prometheus:** Configure Prometheus to enable authentication. Similar to Loki, Prometheus supports authentication methods like HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client authentication. Use authorization rules to restrict access to metrics and API endpoints, controlling who can query and scrape metrics.
    - **Restrict Access to Alloy UI:** If Alloy UI is not intended for public access, restrict access to it using network-level firewalls or by configuring authentication within Alloy itself if possible. Consider disabling Alloy UI in production deployments if it's not necessary for operational purposes to reduce the attack surface.
    - **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the monitoring stack from public networks. Use firewalls to restrict access to ports 3000, 3100, 9090, and 12345 to only trusted networks or IP addresses.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The workshop participant deploys the Docker Compose stack as provided and makes the ports (3000, 3100, 9090, 12345) accessible from a network that an attacker can reach. This could be a public IP address, a publicly accessible hostname, or a network accessible via compromised internal network access.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/docker-compose.yml`**:
        - Exposes port `3000:3000` for Grafana, `3100:3100` for Loki, `9090:9090` for Prometheus, and `12345:12345` for Alloy, making these services accessible on the host machine's network interfaces.
        - Grafana service configuration includes environment variables:
            - `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true`: **Explicitly enables anonymous access to Grafana.**
            - `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin`: **Grants anonymous users Admin role within Grafana, providing full administrative privileges without authentication.**
            - `GF_AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED=false`: Disables basic authentication, further emphasizing anonymous access.
    - **`/code/loki-config.yaml`**:
        - `auth_enabled: false`: **Explicitly disables authentication for Loki.** This means all Loki API endpoints are publicly accessible without any credentials.
    - **Prometheus Configuration**:
        - The `docker-compose.yml` file uses the default Prometheus image and only specifies command-line arguments. It does not include any configuration files to enable authentication. By default, Prometheus does not have authentication enabled unless configured.
    - **Alloy Configuration**:
        - The `docker-compose.yml` file exposes port `12345` for Alloy and mounts `./config.alloy:/etc/alloy/config.alloy`. The command `run --server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345` indicates that the Alloy UI is exposed on all interfaces without specific authentication configuration in the provided files.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/grafana/docker-monitor-workshop.git`
        - Navigate to the code directory: `cd docker-monitor-workshop/code`
        - Deploy the monitoring stack: `docker-compose up -d`
    2. **Test Grafana Unauthenticated Access and Admin Privileges:**
        - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
        - Verify that you can access the Grafana dashboard without being prompted for login credentials.
        - Navigate to "Admin" settings within Grafana. Confirm that you have administrator privileges, such as the ability to add data sources, users, and modify global settings, demonstrating the impact of anonymous admin access.
    3. **Test Loki Unauthenticated API Access:**
        - Open a web browser or use `curl`.
        - Access the Loki build info endpoint: `http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/status/buildinfo`
        - Verify that you receive a JSON response containing Loki build information without any authentication challenge, confirming unauthenticated API access.
    4. **Test Prometheus Unauthenticated UI Access:**
        - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:9090`.
        - Verify that you are able to access the Prometheus UI without being prompted for login credentials.
        - Explore metrics and query functionalities within the Prometheus UI, confirming unauthenticated data access.
    5. **Test Alloy UI Unauthenticated Access:**
        - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:12345`.
        - Verify that you are able to access the Alloy UI without being prompted for login credentials.
        - Explore the Alloy UI to view configuration and status, confirming unauthenticated access to Alloy's management interface.

Successful completion of steps 2 through 5 demonstrates the vulnerability of unauthenticated access across the entire monitoring stack, highlighting the critical need for implementing authentication and access controls.
