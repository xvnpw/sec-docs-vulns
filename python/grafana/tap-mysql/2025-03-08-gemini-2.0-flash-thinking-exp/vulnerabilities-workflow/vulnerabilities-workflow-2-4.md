- vulnerability name: Unintentional Data Extraction via Malicious Properties File
- description: |
  An attacker can craft a malicious `properties.json` file to trick a user into unintentionally extracting sensitive data from their MySQL database.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1. An attacker creates a malicious `properties.json` file. This file is crafted to select tables or columns containing sensitive information that the user might not intend to extract. For example, the attacker could modify the `properties.json` to select tables like `users` or `employees` and columns like `passwords`, `salaries`, or `personal_information`, even if the legitimate user only intended to extract data from less sensitive tables.
  2. The attacker tricks a user into using this malicious `properties.json` file with `tap-mysql`. This could be achieved through various social engineering tactics, such as sending the malicious file via email, hosting it on a compromised website, or any other method that convinces the user to download and use the attacker's `properties.json` instead of a legitimate one.
  3. The user, believing they are using a valid configuration, executes `tap-mysql` with the attacker's malicious `properties.json` file using the command: `$ tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json`.
  4. `tap-mysql`, as designed, reads the `properties.json` file to determine which data to extract. Because the user has provided the malicious file, `tap-mysql` follows the attacker's instructions and connects to the MySQL database and extracts data from the tables and columns specified in the malicious `properties.json`, including the sensitive data that the user did not intend to extract.
  5. The extracted data, now potentially containing sensitive information, is outputted by `tap-mysql` in JSON format, according to the Singer specification. This output is typically directed to standard output, and could be further piped to a Singer target. If the attacker controls the delivery or observation of this output stream, or if the user inadvertently logs or stores this output, the sensitive data is now exposed.
- impact: |
  The impact of this vulnerability is a potential data breach. If an attacker successfully tricks a user into using a malicious `properties.json` file, sensitive data from the MySQL database, such as user credentials, financial information, or personal data, can be unintentionally extracted and potentially exposed to unauthorized parties. This could lead to significant confidentiality violations, compliance issues, and reputational damage.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations: No mitigations are currently implemented within the provided project files to prevent the usage of malicious `properties.json` files. The application processes the `properties.json` file as provided without any validation or security checks on the table and column selections.
- missing mitigations: |
  Several mitigations are missing to address this vulnerability:
  - Input validation for `properties.json`: The tap should implement validation checks on the `properties.json` file to ensure that the selected tables and columns are within an expected or allowed scope. This could involve defining a schema for the `properties.json` and validating against it, or implementing checks to prevent the selection of tables or columns known to contain sensitive data.
  - Principle of least privilege: The tap could be designed to operate with the principle of least privilege in mind. This might involve prompting the user to explicitly confirm the selection of tables and columns, especially those that are considered sensitive or outside the typical scope of data extraction.
  - Documentation and user warnings: The documentation should be updated to clearly warn users about the risks of using untrusted `properties.json` files. It should advise users to only use `properties.json` files from trusted sources and to carefully review the contents of these files before using them with `tap-mysql`. The documentation could also provide guidance on how to create secure `properties.json` files and how to minimize the risk of unintentional data extraction.
- preconditions: |
  The following preconditions must be met to trigger this vulnerability:
  - The attacker has the ability to create or modify a `properties.json` file.
  - The attacker can successfully deliver or convince a legitimate user of `tap-mysql` to use this malicious `properties.json` file.
  - The user executes `tap-mysql` with the malicious `properties.json` file against a MySQL database containing sensitive information.
- source code analysis: |
  Based on the provided project files, specifically the `README.md`, the vulnerability stems from the design of `tap-mysql` which directly utilizes the `properties.json` file to determine data extraction parameters.

  In the `README.md` file, the "Field selection" section describes how users can modify the `properties.json` file (initially generated by `--discover`) to select tables and fields for data extraction.

  ```markdown
  ### Field selection

  In sync mode, `tap-mysql` consumes the catalog and looks for tables and fields
  have been marked as _selected_ in their associated metadata entries.

  Redirect output from the tap's discovery mode to a file so that it can be
  modified:

  ```bash
  $ tap-mysql -c config.json --discover > properties.json
  ```

  Then edit `properties.json` to make selections.
  ```

  This documentation clearly indicates that the `properties.json` file directly dictates the behavior of `tap-mysql` in "sync mode". The command examples:

  ```bash
  $ tap-mysql --config config.json --discover
  $ tap-mysql --config config.json --properties properties.json --state state.json
  ```

  further illustrate the usage of `--properties properties.json` to specify the properties file for the sync operation.

  **Code Flow (Hypothetical based on description):**

  Although the actual Python source code for `tap-mysql` is not provided in the PROJECT FILES, we can infer the vulnerable code flow:

  1. **Command Line Argument Parsing:** `tap-mysql` parses command-line arguments, including `--properties properties.json`.
  2. **Properties File Loading:** The application loads and parses the `properties.json` file specified by the user. This file, as described in `README.md`, contains configurations for stream and field selections.
  3. **Catalog Initialization:** `tap-mysql` initializes its data extraction catalog based on the content of `properties.json`. It reads metadata entries within `properties.json` to identify selected tables and columns.
  4. **Database Query Generation:** When running in sync mode, `tap-mysql` generates SQL queries to extract data from the MySQL database. These queries are constructed based on the selections made in the `properties.json` file.
  5. **Data Extraction:** `tap-mysql` executes the generated SQL queries against the configured MySQL database.
  6. **Output Generation:** The extracted data is formatted as JSON according to the Singer specification and outputted, typically to standard output.

  **Vulnerable Point:**

  The vulnerability lies in **step 2 and 3**. `tap-mysql` blindly trusts the content of `properties.json` without any input validation or sanitization concerning security-sensitive selections. It directly uses the selections defined in this file to construct and execute database queries.  If a malicious `properties.json` is provided, the application will operate as instructed by this file, leading to the unintentional extraction of data.

  **Visualization:**

  ```
  [Attacker-crafted properties.json] --> User --> Executes tap-mysql --properties malicious_properties.json --> tap-mysql (reads malicious properties.json) --> MySQL Database (extracts data based on malicious config) --> Output (sensitive data exposed)
  ```
- security test case: |
  **Title:** Unintentional Data Extraction via Malicious Properties File

  **Description:** This test case validates the vulnerability where a malicious `properties.json` file can be used to unintentionally extract sensitive data from a MySQL database using `tap-mysql`.

  **Preconditions:**
  - A running instance of `tap-mysql` is accessible (e.g., developer environment or test instance).
  - Access to a MySQL database with sensitive data is available for testing (ensure this is a safe testing environment, not production).
  - The `tap-mysql` application is configured to connect to the test MySQL database using a `config.json` file.

  **Steps:**

  1. **Setup Test Database:** Create a test MySQL database (if not already available) and populate it with tables, including one table that simulates sensitive data (e.g., a table named `sensitive_data` with columns like `secret_info`, `id`). Insert some dummy sensitive data into this table. Also, create a non-sensitive table (e.g., `public_data`).

  2. **Create a Legitimate `properties.json` (for comparison):** Run `tap-mysql` in discovery mode to generate a legitimate `properties.json` file that selects only the non-sensitive table (`public_data`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --discover > legitimate_properties.json
     ```
     Modify `legitimate_properties.json` to select only the `public_data` table and its columns for extraction, as described in the `README.md` for field selection.

  3. **Create a Malicious `properties.json`:** Create a new `properties.json` file (e.g., `malicious_properties.json`) or modify a copy of `legitimate_properties.json`. Edit this file to select the sensitive table (`sensitive_data`) and its sensitive columns (`secret_info`, `id`) for extraction. Ensure that the `selected` flag is set to `true` for the `sensitive_data` stream and its properties in the metadata section of `malicious_properties.json`. Do not select the `public_data` table.

  4. **Run `tap-mysql` with Legitimate `properties.json`:** Execute `tap-mysql` using the legitimate `properties.json` file and redirect the output to a file (e.g., `legitimate_output.json`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --properties legitimate_properties.json > legitimate_output.json
     ```
     Inspect `legitimate_output.json` to confirm that only data from the `public_data` table (and not `sensitive_data`) is extracted.

  5. **Run `tap-mysql` with Malicious `properties.json`:** Execute `tap-mysql` using the malicious `properties.json` file and redirect the output to a file (e.g., `malicious_output.json`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json > malicious_output.json
     ```

  6. **Analyze `malicious_output.json`:** Inspect the `malicious_output.json` file. Verify that it contains data from the `sensitive_data` table, including the `secret_info` column. This confirms that the malicious `properties.json` file successfully instructed `tap-mysql` to extract sensitive data.

  7. **Compare Outputs:** Compare `legitimate_output.json` and `malicious_output.json`. The `legitimate_output.json` should only contain data from `public_data`, while `malicious_output.json` should additionally contain data from `sensitive_data`.

  **Expected Result:**
  - `legitimate_output.json` contains data only from the `public_data` table.
  - `malicious_output.json` contains data from the `sensitive_data` table, including the `secret_info` column, demonstrating the unintentional extraction of sensitive data due to the malicious `properties.json` file.
  - This test case successfully demonstrates the vulnerability, as an attacker-crafted `properties.json` file can indeed cause `tap-mysql` to extract sensitive data without the user's explicit intent or awareness, simply by tricking the user into using the malicious configuration file.
