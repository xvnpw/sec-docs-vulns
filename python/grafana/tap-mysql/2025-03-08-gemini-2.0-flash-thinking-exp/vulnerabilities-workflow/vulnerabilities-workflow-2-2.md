- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Database Credentials

- **Description:**
    1. The tap-mysql project requires users to create a `config.json` file to store sensitive MySQL database credentials, including host, port, username, and password.
    2. The README.md documentation provides an example `config.json` file and instructs users to use the `--config config.json` parameter when running the tap.
    3. If a user inadvertently exposes this `config.json` file (e.g., by placing it in a publicly accessible location like a web server directory, misconfigured cloud storage, or committing it to a public repository), an attacker can easily access the database credentials.
    4. An attacker can then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database.
    - This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breach:**  The attacker can read and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.
        - **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
        - **Service Disruption:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the database service, causing downtime and impacting applications relying on the database.
    - The vulnerability is ranked as **High** due to the potential for significant data and system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The tap-mysql project, as provided in the project files, does not implement any specific mitigations for this vulnerability.
    - The README.md documentation guides users on creating the `config.json` file but lacks sufficient warnings or best practices regarding secure storage and handling of database credentials.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Enhancement:**
        - **Security Warning:** The README.md should include a prominent security warning highlighting the risks associated with storing database credentials in `config.json` and the potential consequences of exposing this file.
        - **Best Practices:** The documentation should strongly recommend against storing credentials directly in `config.json` for production environments and suggest secure alternatives such as:
            - **Environment Variables:**  Advising users to use environment variables to pass credentials to the tap, as environment variables are generally considered more secure than configuration files for sensitive information.
            - **Secrets Management Tools:**  Mentioning and recommending the use of secrets management tools or services provided by cloud providers or dedicated secrets management solutions for storing and retrieving credentials securely.
        - **Secure File Handling:** If `config.json` is used, the documentation must emphasize the user's responsibility to:
            - **Restrict Access:**  Ensure that the `config.json` file is stored with appropriate file system permissions, restricting read access only to the user running the tap.
            - **Avoid Public Exposure:**  Explicitly warn against placing `config.json` in publicly accessible locations or committing it to version control systems, especially public repositories.
    - **Code-Level Mitigations (Less Applicable for a Tap):**
        - While less critical for a tap (whose primary concern is data extraction, not configuration security), the tap could be improved to:
            - **Prioritize Environment Variables:**  Modify the tap to check for and prioritize database credentials from environment variables before attempting to load them from `config.json`. This encourages users to adopt more secure configuration practices.
            - **Configuration Validation:**  Implement basic validation checks on the configuration parameters loaded from `config.json` to detect potentially insecure or invalid configurations early on.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. **User Configuration:** A user must create a `config.json` file and store MySQL database credentials within it as instructed by the tap's documentation.
    2. **File Exposure:** The `config.json` file must be inadvertently exposed to unauthorized access. This can occur through various means, such as:
        - **Public Web Server:** Placing `config.json` in a directory accessible by a web server.
        - **Misconfigured Cloud Storage:**  Storing `config.json` in a cloud storage bucket with overly permissive access controls.
        - **Public Repository Commit:**  Accidentally committing `config.json` to a public version control repository like GitHub.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The provided project files do not contain the core tap logic that reads and processes the `config.json` file. However, the `README.md` and command-line usage examples clearly indicate that `tap-mysql` expects a `--config config.json` argument, implying that the tap's code is designed to load database connection parameters from this file.
    - **File: /code/README.md**
        ```markdown
        ### Create the configuration file

        Create a config file containing the database connection credentials, e.g.:

        ```json
        {
          "host": "localhost",
          "port": "3306",
          "user": "root",
          "password": "password"
        }
        ```

        ...

        ```bash
        $ tap-mysql --config config.json --discover
        $ tap-mysql --config config.json --properties properties.json --state state.json
        ```
        - This section of the README.md explicitly instructs users to create a `config.json` file and use it with the `--config` flag, confirming that the tap relies on this file for configuration, including database credentials.
    - **Absence of Security Measures:**  A review of the provided files (Dockerfile, CircleCI config, setup.py, test files, db_utils.py, connection.py, __init__.py, sync strategy files) reveals no code or configurations within these files that implement any security measures to protect the `config.json` file or the database credentials it contains. The focus is on tap functionality, data extraction, and testing, not secure configuration management.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup (Attacker Perspective):**
        - **Public Repository Creation:** Create a public GitHub repository (or simulate a publicly accessible file storage).
        - **Vulnerable Tap Configuration:** Within this public repository, include:
            - A `config.json` file containing **dummy but valid-format** MySQL database credentials (e.g., host: "localhost", port: "3306", user: "testuser", password: "testpassword").
            - A simple Python script (e.g., `run_tap.py`) that executes `tap-mysql` using the `--config config.json` argument and attempts to perform discovery or sync (even with dummy data).
            - Example `run_tap.py` script:
              ```python
              import subprocess

              try:
                  subprocess.run(["tap-mysql", "--config", "config.json", "--discover"], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
                  print("Tap executed successfully (discovery mode).")
              except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                  print(f"Tap execution failed: {e}")
                  print(f"Stdout: {e.stdout}")
                  print(f"Stderr: {e.stderr}")
              except FileNotFoundError:
                  print("Error: tap-mysql command not found. Ensure it's installed and in PATH.")

              ```
        - **Public Exposure:** Commit and push these files to the public GitHub repository.

    2. **Exploit (Attacker Actions):**
        - **Repository Discovery:** As an attacker, discover the public GitHub repository (e.g., through search engines, social media, or if the repository URL is inadvertently shared).
        - **Configuration File Access:** Browse the repository's file list and locate the `config.json` file.
        - **Credential Extraction:** Download or directly view the `config.json` file's contents. The attacker now has access to the database credentials (in this test case, the dummy credentials).

    3. **Verification (Vulnerability Confirmation):**
        - **Exposed Configuration:** The test case successfully demonstrates that the `config.json` file, containing database credentials, is readily accessible to anyone who can access the public repository.
        - **Potential for Real Credential Exposure:** While the test uses dummy credentials for safety, it clearly illustrates the vulnerability. If a user were to mistakenly include *real* database credentials in `config.json` and expose the repository, a malicious actor could easily extract those credentials.
        - **Unauthorized Access (Hypothetical with Real Credentials):** In a real-world scenario with exposed *live* credentials, the attacker would then use the extracted credentials to attempt to connect to the MySQL database from a remote location using tools like `mysql` command-line client or database management software, thus achieving unauthorized access.

This security test case validates the vulnerability by demonstrating how easily an attacker can access the configuration file containing database credentials when it is publicly exposed, fulfilling the conditions outlined in the vulnerability description.
