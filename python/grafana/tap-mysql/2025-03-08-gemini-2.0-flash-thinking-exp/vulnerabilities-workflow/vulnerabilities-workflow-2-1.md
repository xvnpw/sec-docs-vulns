- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Table and Column Names

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `properties.json` file.
    2. The attacker injects SQL code into the `table_name` or column names within the `properties.json` file.
    3. When `tap-mysql` processes the `properties.json` file, it uses these injected values to construct SQL queries for data extraction without proper sanitization.
    4. The malicious SQL code is executed against the MySQL database during data extraction.
    5. This can occur when the tap uses the `table_name` from `properties.json` to dynamically build SQL queries, especially in functions that handle metadata and schema discovery.

- Impact:
    Successful SQL injection through table or column names can lead to:
    - Data Breach: Unauthorized access to data beyond the intended tables, potentially including sensitive information from other tables within the database.
    - Data Manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in unintended tables, depending on the database user's privileges and the injected SQL code.
    - Information Disclosure: Revealing database schema, structure, and potentially sensitive data through crafted queries.
    - Integrity Compromise: Modifying the data being extracted, leading to inconsistent or corrupted data in the target system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided project files. Review of the provided test files (`test_mysql_full_table_interruption.py`, `test_mysql_full_and_incremental.py`, `test_mysql_binlog_json.py`, `test_mysql_binlog.py`, `test_mysql_binlog_edge_cases.py`, `test_mysql_incremental_limit.py`, `test_date_types.py`, `test_full_table_interruption.py`, `test_query_building.py`, `test_tap_mysql.py`) and `db_utils.py` does not indicate any input sanitization or parameterized query usage for table or column names.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization for all table and column names read from the `properties.json` file before incorporating them into SQL queries. This should include escaping special characters and validating the input against a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns.
    - Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements: Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, ensuring that table and column names are treated as identifiers and not directly embedded as strings in SQL queries.
    - Input Validation: Validate the structure and content of the `properties.json` file against an expected schema to prevent unexpected or malicious inputs.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify or control the `properties.json` file used by `tap-mysql`. This could be through compromising the system where `tap-mysql` is running, intercepting or manipulating the file during configuration, or through other means of unauthorized access.
    - The tap must be configured to use a `properties.json` file controlled by the attacker.

- Source Code Analysis:
    Since the source code of `tap-mysql` is not provided, this analysis is based on potential vulnerable code patterns that are common in similar applications and inferred from the project description.

    Assuming the tap constructs SQL queries dynamically using table and column names from `properties.json`, a vulnerable code snippet might look like this (hypothetical example):

    ```python
    def extract_data(config, properties):
        connection = connect_to_db(config)
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        for stream_property in properties['streams']:
            table_name = stream_property['table_name'] # Vulnerable input
            columns = [prop['column_name'] for prop in stream_property['schema']['properties']] # Potentially vulnerable input

            select_columns_sql = ", ".join(columns) # Column names not sanitized
            query = f"SELECT {select_columns_sql} FROM {table_name}" # Table name not sanitized

            cursor.execute(query) # Vulnerable execution
            # ... process results ...
    ```
    In this hypothetical example, both `table_name` and `columns` are taken directly from the `properties.json` and inserted into the SQL query without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code within these values, leading to arbitrary SQL execution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up `tap-mysql` in sync mode with a test MySQL database.
    2. Create a malicious `properties.json` file. In this file, modify the `table_name` within the `metadata` section of a stream to include an SQL injection payload. For example:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "breadcrumb": [],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true,
              "replication-method": "FULL_TABLE",
              "table-name": "animals; SELECT SLEEP(5); --",
              "database-name": "example_db"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "id"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "name"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "likes_getting_petted"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
        In this example, `table-name` is injected with `animals; SELECT SLEEP(5); --`. This attempts to execute a `SLEEP` command after the intended query on the `animals` table.
    3. Run `tap-mysql` in sync mode using the malicious `properties.json` and a valid `config.json`:
        ```bash
        tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json
        ```
    4. Monitor the execution time of `tap-mysql`. If the injected `SLEEP(5)` command is executed, the execution time should increase noticeably (by at least 5 seconds in this example). You can also check the MySQL server logs for any errors or unusual activity indicating SQL injection.
    5. To further test, attempt more impactful injections, such as `UNION SELECT` to extract data or `DROP TABLE` to cause data loss, carefully in a test environment.
    6. If the `tap-mysql` execution time increases as expected or the database reflects the injected SQL commands (depending on the injection type), it validates the SQL injection vulnerability in table names.
