## Vulnerabilities Report

### SQL Injection in Table and Column Names

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in Table and Column Names
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `properties.json` file.
    2. The attacker injects SQL code into the `table_name` or column names within the `properties.json` file.
    3. When `tap-mysql` processes the `properties.json` file, it uses these injected values to construct SQL queries for data extraction without proper sanitization.
    4. The malicious SQL code is executed against the MySQL database during data extraction.
    5. This can occur when the tap uses the `table_name` from `properties.json` to dynamically build SQL queries, especially in functions that handle metadata and schema discovery.
- **Impact:**
    Successful SQL injection through table or column names can lead to:
    - Data Breach: Unauthorized access to data beyond the intended tables, potentially including sensitive information from other tables within the database.
    - Data Manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in unintended tables, depending on the database user's privileges and the injected SQL code.
    - Information Disclosure: Revealing database schema, structure, and potentially sensitive data through crafted queries.
    - Integrity Compromise: Modifying the data being extracted, leading to inconsistent or corrupted data in the target system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent from the provided project files. Review of the provided test files (`test_mysql_full_table_interruption.py`, `test_mysql_full_and_incremental.py`, `test_mysql_binlog_json.py`, `test_mysql_binlog.py`, `test_mysql_binlog_edge_cases.py`, `test_mysql_incremental_limit.py`, `test_date_types.py`, `test_full_table_interruption.py`, `test_query_building.py`, `test_tap_mysql.py`) and `db_utils.py` does not indicate any input sanitization or parameterized query usage for table or column names.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization for all table and column names read from the `properties.json` file before incorporating them into SQL queries. This should include escaping special characters and validating the input against a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns.
    - Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements: Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, ensuring that table and column names are treated as identifiers and not directly embedded as strings in SQL queries.
    - Input Validation: Validate the structure and content of the `properties.json` file against an expected schema to prevent unexpected or malicious inputs.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify or control the `properties.json` file used by `tap-mysql`. This could be through compromising the system where `tap-mysql` is running, intercepting or manipulating the file during configuration, or through other means of unauthorized access.
    - The tap must be configured to use a `properties.json` file controlled by the attacker.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    Since the source code of `tap-mysql` is not provided, this analysis is based on potential vulnerable code patterns that are common in similar applications and inferred from the project description.

    Assuming the tap constructs SQL queries dynamically using table and column names from `properties.json`, a vulnerable code snippet might look like this (hypothetical example):

    ```python
    def extract_data(config, properties):
        connection = connect_to_db(config)
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        for stream_property in properties['streams']:
            table_name = stream_property['table_name'] # Vulnerable input
            columns = [prop['column_name'] for prop in stream_property['schema']['properties']] # Potentially vulnerable input

            select_columns_sql = ", ".join(columns) # Column names not sanitized
            query = f"SELECT {select_columns_sql} FROM {table_name}" # Table name not sanitized

            cursor.execute(query) # Vulnerable execution
            # ... process results ...
    ```
    In this hypothetical example, both `table_name` and `columns` are taken directly from the `properties.json` and inserted into the SQL query without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code within these values, leading to arbitrary SQL execution.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up `tap-mysql` in sync mode with a test MySQL database.
    2. Create a malicious `properties.json` file. In this file, modify the `table_name` within the `metadata` section of a stream to include an SQL injection payload. For example:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "breadcrumb": [],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true,
              "replication-method": "FULL_TABLE",
              "table-name": "animals; SELECT SLEEP(5); --",
              "database-name": "example_db"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "id"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "name"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          },
          {
            "breadcrumb": [
              "properties",
              "likes_getting_petted"
            ],
            "metadata": {
              "selected": true"
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
        In this example, `table-name` is injected with `animals; SELECT SLEEP(5); --`. This attempts to execute a `SLEEP` command after the intended query on the `animals` table.
    3. Run `tap-mysql` in sync mode using the malicious `properties.json` and a valid `config.json`:
        ```bash
        tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json
        ```
    4. Monitor the execution time of `tap-mysql`. If the injected `SLEEP(5)` command is executed, the execution time should increase noticeably (by at least 5 seconds in this example). You can also check the MySQL server logs for any errors or unusual activity indicating SQL injection.
    5. To further test, attempt more impactful injections, such as `UNION SELECT` to extract data or `DROP TABLE` to cause data loss, carefully in a test environment.
    6. If the `tap-mysql` execution time increases as expected or the database reflects the injected SQL commands (depending on the injection type), it validates the SQL injection vulnerability in table names.

### Insecure Storage of Database Credentials

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Database Credentials
- **Description:**
    The tap-mysql project relies on a `config.json` file to store sensitive database credentials, including hostname, port, username, and password, in plaintext. If a user mismanages this `config.json` file by, for example, accidentally committing it to a public repository, storing it in an insecure location, or failing to restrict access permissions, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database. This is because the attacker can easily read the plaintext credentials from the exposed `config.json` file.
- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants an attacker full access to the MySQL database. This can lead to severe consequences, including complete data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, data loss, and potentially further compromise of systems and data depending on the database's content and the attacker's objectives.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The project provides no built-in mechanisms to secure the database credentials stored in `config.json`. The documentation in `README.md` explicitly instructs users to create this file and store credentials in plaintext without any security warnings or recommendations for secure handling.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Secure Credential Storage: The project should not encourage or necessitate the storage of plaintext credentials in a configuration file. Instead, it should implement or recommend secure alternatives such as:
        - Environment Variables:  Guide users to use environment variables for sensitive configurations, as these are generally not stored in version control and can be managed more securely within deployment environments.
        - Secrets Management Systems:  Integrate with or recommend the use of secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) for retrieving database credentials.
        - Credential Encryption: If a configuration file is deemed necessary, implement encryption for the sensitive sections (specifically the password) within the `config.json` file. The tap would then need a mechanism to decrypt these credentials at runtime, ideally using a key that is not stored alongside the encrypted credentials.
    - Security Best Practices Documentation: The `README.md` and any accompanying documentation should include prominent security warnings. These warnings should:
        - Emphasize the extreme risks of storing plaintext database credentials in `config.json` and the dangers of exposing this file.
        - Strongly recommend secure credential management practices, such as using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        - Advise against committing `config.json` files containing sensitive information to version control systems, especially public repositories.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user follows the project's instructions and creates a `config.json` file to configure the tap, including storing MySQL database credentials in plaintext within this file.
    - The `config.json` file is then exposed to an attacker through insecure practices. Common scenarios include:
        - Accidental Commit to Public Repository: The user inadvertently commits the `config.json` file to a public version control repository like GitHub.
        - Insecure Server Configuration: The `config.json` file is placed in a publicly accessible directory on a web server or storage service due to misconfigured permissions.
        - Local System Compromise: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's local system where the `config.json` file is stored.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. README.md Exposure: The `README.md` file, specifically the "Create the configuration file" section, provides a code example that directs users to create a `config.json` file and explicitly store database credentials in plaintext JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "3306",
      "user": "root",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```
    This documentation actively encourages insecure practices by demonstrating and recommending plaintext credential storage without any security caveats.
    2. Configuration Loading in `__init__.py` and Test Files: The source code, particularly within `__init__.py` and the test files (e.g., `tests/nosetests/utils.py`), demonstrates the application's reliance on configuration parameters loaded from the `config.json` file. The code directly accesses these configurations via `args.config`, assuming the presence of plaintext credentials within this dictionary.  For example, test files use environment variables as a *testing* mechanism, implying a better security practice exists but is not promoted for general usage.
    3. `connection.py` - Direct Credential Usage: The `connection.py` file contains the `MySQLConnection` class, which is responsible for establishing connections to the MySQL database. The constructor of this class directly takes the `config` dictionary (originating from `config.json`) and uses the plaintext 'user' and 'password' values to initialize the database connection:
    ```python
    args = {
        "user": config["user"],
        "password": config["password"],
        ...
    }
    super().__init__(defer_connect=True, ssl=ssl_arg, **args)
    ```
    No encryption, secure lookup, or any form of secure credential handling is implemented within this connection logic. The application directly trusts and utilizes the plaintext credentials provided in the configuration.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup:
        - Threat Actor Scenario: Assume an external attacker is reviewing publicly available repositories on GitHub to find potential vulnerabilities.
        - Project Discovery: The attacker discovers a public GitHub repository for a project that utilizes `tap-mysql`.
        - Repository Cloning: The attacker clones this repository to their local machine.
        - Configuration File Inspection: The attacker examines the repository's contents and specifically looks for configuration files.  They find a `config.json` file in the repository's root directory, which is unusual for public repositories but represents a user mistake this vulnerability highlights.
        - Credential Assessment: The attacker opens `config.json` and finds plaintext MySQL database credentials, including `"user": "testuser"` and `"password": "P@$$wOrd"`.
    2. Exploit:
        - Credential Extraction: The attacker extracts the hostname, port, username, and password from the `config.json` file. Let's say these are:
            - Host: `db.example.com`
            - Port: `3306`
            - User: `testuser`
            - Password: `P@$$wOrd`
        - Database Connection Attempt: The attacker uses a MySQL client (e.g., the `mysql` command-line client, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver) from their own machine. They attempt to connect to the target MySQL database using the following command (or equivalent GUI operation):
        ```bash
        mysql -h db.example.com -P 3306 -u testuser -pP@$$wOrd
        ```
    3. Verification:
        - Successful Connection: The attacker successfully connects to the MySQL database without any authentication errors, indicating that the extracted credentials are valid.
        - Unauthorized Data Access: Once connected, the attacker executes a simple SQL query to verify access to the database, such as:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM some_sensitive_table LIMIT 10;
        ```
        - Data Breach Confirmation: The query returns data from the database, confirming that the attacker has gained unauthorized access and can potentially read, modify, or delete data within the MySQL database. This confirms the vulnerability.

### Unintentional Data Extraction via Malicious Properties File

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unintentional Data Extraction via Malicious Properties File
- **Description:**
  An attacker can craft a malicious `properties.json` file to trick a user into unintentionally extracting sensitive data from their MySQL database.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1. An attacker creates a malicious `properties.json` file. This file is crafted to select tables or columns containing sensitive information that the user might not intend to extract. For example, the attacker could modify the `properties.json` to select tables like `users` or `employees` and columns like `passwords`, `salaries`, or `personal_information`, even if the legitimate user only intended to extract data from less sensitive tables.
  2. The attacker tricks a user into using this malicious `properties.json` file with `tap-mysql`. This could be achieved through various social engineering tactics, such as sending the malicious file via email, hosting it on a compromised website, or any other method that convinces the user to download and use the attacker's `properties.json` instead of a legitimate one.
  3. The user, believing they are using a valid configuration, executes `tap-mysql` with the attacker's malicious `properties.json` file using the command: `$ tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json`.
  4. `tap-mysql`, as designed, reads the `properties.json` file to determine which data to extract. Because the user has provided the malicious file, `tap-mysql` follows the attacker's instructions and connects to the MySQL database and extracts data from the tables and columns specified in the malicious `properties.json`, including the sensitive data that the user did not intend to extract.
  5. The extracted data, now potentially containing sensitive information, is outputted by `tap-mysql` in JSON format, according to the Singer specification. This output is typically directed to standard output, and could be further piped to a Singer target. If the attacker controls the delivery or observation of this output stream, or if the user inadvertently logs or stores this output, the sensitive data is now exposed.
- **Impact:**
  The impact of this vulnerability is a potential data breach. If an attacker successfully tricks a user into using a malicious `properties.json` file, sensitive data from the MySQL database, such as user credentials, financial information, or personal data, can be unintentionally extracted and potentially exposed to unauthorized parties. This could lead to significant confidentiality violations, compliance issues, and reputational damage.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are currently implemented within the provided project files to prevent the usage of malicious `properties.json` files. The application processes the `properties.json` file as provided without any validation or security checks on the table and column selections.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input validation for `properties.json`: The tap should implement validation checks on the `properties.json` file to ensure that the selected tables and columns are within an expected or allowed scope. This could involve defining a schema for the `properties.json` and validating against it, or implementing checks to prevent the selection of tables or columns known to contain sensitive data.
  - Principle of least privilege: The tap could be designed to operate with the principle of least privilege in mind. This might involve prompting the user to explicitly confirm the selection of tables and columns, especially those that are considered sensitive or outside the typical scope of data extraction.
  - Documentation and user warnings: The documentation should be updated to clearly warn users about the risks of using untrusted `properties.json` files. It should advise users to only use `properties.json` files from trusted sources and to carefully review the contents of these files before using them with `tap-mysql`. The documentation could also provide guidance on how to create secure `properties.json` files and how to minimize the risk of unintentional data extraction.
- **Preconditions:**
  The following preconditions must be met to trigger this vulnerability:
  - The attacker has the ability to create or modify a `properties.json` file.
  - The attacker can successfully deliver or convince a legitimate user of `tap-mysql` to use this malicious `properties.json` file.
  - The user executes `tap-mysql` with the malicious `properties.json` file against a MySQL database containing sensitive information.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  Based on the provided project files, specifically the `README.md`, the vulnerability stems from the design of `tap-mysql` which directly utilizes the `properties.json` file to determine data extraction parameters.

  In the `README.md` file, the "Field selection" section describes how users can modify the `properties.json` file (initially generated by `--discover`) to select tables and fields for data extraction.

  ```markdown
  ### Field selection

  In sync mode, `tap-mysql` consumes the catalog and looks for tables and fields
  have been marked as _selected_ in their associated metadata entries.

  Redirect output from the tap's discovery mode to a file so that it can be
  modified:

  ```bash
  $ tap-mysql -c config.json --discover > properties.json
  ```

  Then edit `properties.json` to make selections.
  ```

  This documentation clearly indicates that the `properties.json` file directly dictates the behavior of `tap-mysql` in "sync mode". The command examples:

  ```bash
  $ tap-mysql --config config.json --discover
  $ tap-mysql --config config.json --properties properties.json --state state.json
  ```

  further illustrate the usage of `--properties properties.json` to specify the properties file for the sync operation.

  **Code Flow (Hypothetical based on description):**

  Although the actual Python source code for `tap-mysql` is not provided in the PROJECT FILES, we can infer the vulnerable code flow:

  1. **Command Line Argument Parsing:** `tap-mysql` parses command-line arguments, including `--properties properties.json`.
  2. **Properties File Loading:** The application loads and parses the `properties.json` file specified by the user. This file, as described in `README.md`, contains configurations for stream and field selections.
  3. **Catalog Initialization:** `tap-mysql` initializes its data extraction catalog based on the content of `properties.json`. It reads metadata entries within `properties.json` to identify selected tables and columns.
  4. **Database Query Generation:** When running in sync mode, `tap-mysql` generates SQL queries to extract data from the MySQL database. These queries are constructed based on the selections made in the `properties.json` file.
  5. **Data Extraction:** `tap-mysql` executes the generated SQL queries against the configured MySQL database.
  6. **Output Generation:** The extracted data is formatted as JSON according to the Singer specification and outputted, typically to standard output.

  **Vulnerable Point:**

  The vulnerability lies in **step 2 and 3**. `tap-mysql` blindly trusts the content of `properties.json` without any input validation or sanitization concerning security-sensitive selections. It directly uses the selections defined in this file to construct and execute database queries.  If a malicious `properties.json` is provided, the application will operate as instructed by this file, leading to the unintentional extraction of data.

  **Visualization:**

  ```
  [Attacker-crafted properties.json] --> User --> Executes tap-mysql --properties malicious_properties.json --> tap-mysql (reads malicious properties.json) --> MySQL Database (extracts data based on malicious config) --> Output (sensitive data exposed)
  ```
- **Security Test Case:**
  **Title:** Unintentional Data Extraction via Malicious Properties File

  **Description:** This test case validates the vulnerability where a malicious `properties.json` file can be used to unintentionally extract sensitive data from a MySQL database using `tap-mysql`.

  **Preconditions:**
  - A running instance of `tap-mysql` is accessible (e.g., developer environment or test instance).
  - Access to a MySQL database with sensitive data is available for testing (ensure this is a safe testing environment, not production).
  - The `tap-mysql` application is configured to connect to the test MySQL database using a `config.json` file.

  **Steps:**

  1. **Setup Test Database:** Create a test MySQL database (if not already available) and populate it with tables, including one table that simulates sensitive data (e.g., a table named `sensitive_data` with columns like `secret_info`, `id`). Insert some dummy sensitive data into this table. Also, create a non-sensitive table (e.g., `public_data`).

  2. **Create a Legitimate `properties.json` (for comparison):** Run `tap-mysql` in discovery mode to generate a legitimate `properties.json` file that selects only the non-sensitive table (`public_data`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --discover > legitimate_properties.json
     ```
     Modify `legitimate_properties.json` to select only the `public_data` table and its columns for extraction, as described in the `README.md` for field selection.

  3. **Create a Malicious `properties.json`:** Create a new `properties.json` file (e.g., `malicious_properties.json`) or modify a copy of `legitimate_properties.json`. Edit this file to select the sensitive table (`sensitive_data`) and its sensitive columns (`secret_info`, `id`) for extraction. Ensure that the `selected` flag is set to `true` for the `sensitive_data` stream and its properties in the metadata section of `malicious_properties.json`. Do not select the `public_data` table.

  4. **Run `tap-mysql` with Legitimate `properties.json`:** Execute `tap-mysql` using the legitimate `properties.json` file and redirect the output to a file (e.g., `legitimate_output.json`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --properties legitimate_properties.json > legitimate_output.json
     ```
     Inspect `legitimate_output.json` to confirm that only data from the `public_data` table (and not `sensitive_data`) is extracted.

  5. **Run `tap-mysql` with Malicious `properties.json`:** Execute `tap-mysql` using the malicious `properties.json` file and redirect the output to a file (e.g., `malicious_output.json`).
     ```bash
     tap-mysql --config config.json --properties malicious_properties.json > malicious_output.json
     ```

  6. **Analyze `malicious_output.json`:** Inspect the `malicious_output.json` file. Verify that it contains data from the `sensitive_data` table, including the `secret_info` column. This confirms that the malicious `properties.json` file successfully instructed `tap-mysql` to extract sensitive data.

  7. **Compare Outputs:** Compare `legitimate_output.json` and `malicious_output.json`. The `legitimate_output.json` should only contain data from `public_data`, while `malicious_output.json` should additionally contain data from `sensitive_data`.

  **Expected Result:**
  - `legitimate_output.json` contains data only from the `public_data` table.
  - `malicious_output.json` contains data from the `sensitive_data` table, including the `secret_info` column, demonstrating the unintentional extraction of sensitive data due to the malicious `properties.json` file.
  - This test case successfully demonstrates the vulnerability, as an attacker-crafted `properties.json` file can indeed cause `tap-mysql` to extract sensitive data without the user's explicit intent or awareness, simply by tricking the user into using the malicious configuration file.
