### Vulnerability List

#### 1. API Key Exposure through Environment Variables

- **Description:**
    1. The Grafana MCP server application uses the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the Grafana API.
    2. Environment variables are a common way to configure applications, but they can be vulnerable to exposure if the server environment is compromised or misconfigured.
    3. An attacker who gains access to the server environment (e.g., through a server breach, insider threat, or misconfigured access controls) can potentially read the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable.
    4. Once the attacker obtains the `GRAFANA_API_KEY`, they can use it to make unauthorized requests to the Grafana API, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Grafana instance.
    - The level of access depends on the permissions associated with the Grafana API key. An attacker could potentially:
        - View sensitive dashboards and data sources.
        - Access and modify Grafana configurations.
        - View and manipulate incidents.
        - Potentially gain further access to systems integrated with Grafana, depending on the Grafana instance's configuration and network setup.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project documentation (File: `/code/README.md`) recommends creating a Grafana service account with limited permissions. This is a good practice to reduce the potential impact of a compromised API key by limiting the actions an attacker can perform even if they obtain the key. This mitigation is documented in the "Usage" section of the README.md file.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Storage for API Key:** The API key is currently read directly from environment variables, which are not a secure storage mechanism. Missing mitigations include:
        - Using a secrets management system (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager) to store and retrieve the API key.
        - Encrypting the configuration file where the API key is stored, although this is less secure than a dedicated secrets manager.
        - Avoiding storing the API key directly in environment variables in production environments.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While less directly related to exposure, the application does not perform any validation or sanitization on the API key itself. Although in this scenario the API key is treated as a bearer token by `httpx`, validating the format of the key could add a layer of defense in depth.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The Grafana MCP server must be deployed and configured to use a `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication.
    - An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the environment where the Grafana MCP server is running. This could be through various means, such as:
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's operating system or other software.
        - Gaining access through compromised credentials (e.g., SSH keys, passwords).
        - Insider threat.
        - Misconfiguration of cloud environment or container orchestration platform, leading to unintended exposure of environment variables.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Configuration Loading (`/code/src/mcp_grafana/settings.py`):**
        ```python
        class GrafanaSettings(BaseSettings):
            model_config: SettingsConfigDict = SettingsConfigDict(
                env_prefix="GRAFANA_", env_file=".env", env_nested_delimiter="__"
            )

            ...
            api_key: str | None = Field(
                default=None,
                description="A Grafana API key or service account token with the necessary permissions to use the tools.",
            )
        ```
        This code snippet from `src/mcp_grafana/settings.py` shows that the `GrafanaSettings` class, which is responsible for loading configuration, is set up to read environment variables with the prefix `GRAFANA_`. Specifically, the `api_key` field is intended to be populated from the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable.

    2. **Client Authentication (`/code/src/mcp_grafana/client.py`):**
        ```python
        class GrafanaClient:
            def __init__(self, url: str, api_key: str | None = None) -> None:
                auth = BearerAuth(api_key) if api_key is not None else None
                self.c = httpx.AsyncClient(
                    base_url=url, auth=auth, timeout=httpx.Timeout(timeout=30.0)
                )
        ```
        ```python
        grafana_client = GrafanaClient(grafana_settings.url, api_key=grafana_settings.api_key)
        ```
        In `src/mcp_grafana/client.py`, the `GrafanaClient` class initializes an `httpx.AsyncClient`. If an `api_key` is provided during `GrafanaClient` instantiation, a `BearerAuth` object is created and used for authentication. The `grafana_client` instance is created using settings loaded by `GrafanaSettings`, including the `api_key` from the environment variable.

    3. **Bearer Authentication Class (`/code/src/mcp_grafana/client.py`):**
        ```python
        class BearerAuth(httpx.Auth):
            def __init__(self, api_key: str):
                self.api_key = api_key

            def auth_flow(self, request):
                request.headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {self.api_key}"
                yield request
        ```
        The `BearerAuth` class in `src/mcp_grafana/client.py` explicitly sets the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme and the provided `api_key`. This confirms that the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable is directly used as the API key for authenticating requests to the Grafana API.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Environment Variable (GRAFANA_API_KEY) --> GrafanaSettings (api_key) --> GrafanaClient (api_key) --> BearerAuth --> HTTP Request (Authorization Header) --> Grafana API
    ```

    This flow clearly shows how the API key from the environment variable is used to authenticate with Grafana. If an attacker can access the environment variables, they can retrieve the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` and impersonate the MCP server.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Deploy a Grafana instance (e.g., using Docker Compose as described in `/code/docker-compose.yaml`).
        - Build and run the `mcp-grafana` server (e.g., using Docker as described in `/code/Dockerfile` and `/code/README.md`).
        - Set the `GRAFANA_URL` environment variable to point to your Grafana instance (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
        - **Crucially, set the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable to a valid Grafana API key or service account token.** For testing purposes, you can create a temporary API key in Grafana with admin privileges to fully demonstrate the impact. **Remember to revoke this key after testing.**
    2. **Attacker Access Simulation:** Assume the attacker has gained access to the running container or server where the `mcp-grafana` application is deployed. For example, if using Docker, the attacker could execute a shell inside the running container:
        ```bash
        docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
        ```
    3. **Retrieve API Key:** Inside the container/server environment, the attacker attempts to read the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` environment variable:
        ```bash
        printenv GRAFANA_API_KEY
        # Or:
        echo $GRAFANA_API_KEY
        ```
        The command will output the value of the `GRAFANA_API_KEY`, which is the Grafana API key used by the MCP server.
    4. **Unauthorized Grafana API Access:** The attacker now uses the retrieved API key to make a direct request to the Grafana API from their own machine (outside the server environment). Using `curl` as an example:
        ```bash
        API_KEY="<retrieved_api_key>"
        GRAFANA_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Or your deployed Grafana URL
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" "${GRAFANA_URL}/api/datasources"
        ```
        - Replace `<retrieved_api_key>` with the API key obtained in the previous step.
        - Replace `http://localhost:3000` with the actual URL of your Grafana instance if different.
    5. **Verification:**
        - If the API key is valid and the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the `curl` command will return a JSON response containing a list of Grafana datasources. This confirms that the attacker has successfully used the exposed API key to access the Grafana API without proper authorization checks on the MCP server itself.
        - Examine the Grafana server logs (if available) to further confirm that the API request originated from outside the MCP server and was authenticated using the compromised API key.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker who gains access to the server environment can easily retrieve the `GRAFANA_API_KEY` and use it to directly access the Grafana API, bypassing the MCP server application entirely and gaining unauthorized access to Grafana.
