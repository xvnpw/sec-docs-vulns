- Vulnerability Name: Flask Development Server Misconfiguration
- Description: The project's README.md instructs users to run the Flask application using the command `flask run`. This command starts the Flask development server, which is explicitly warned against being used in production environments in the official Flask documentation. The development server is designed for debugging and development purposes and is not hardened for security or performance in production. An attacker could potentially exploit known vulnerabilities inherent in the Flask development server if the application is naively deployed to a production-like environment following the README instructions. This includes potential for information disclosure, denial of service, and other attacks due to the lack of security features and performance optimizations in the development server.
- Impact: High. If an attacker successfully exploits vulnerabilities in the Flask development server, they could gain unauthorized access to application data, manipulate the application, or cause a denial of service. This is particularly critical if the application is deployed in a production or production-like environment where sensitive data or critical services might be exposed.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The README.md implicitly suggests this is a sample application for demonstration purposes and a tutorial, not intended for production use. However, this is not an explicit security mitigation and relies on the user's understanding of deployment best practices.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicit warning in the README.md against using `flask run` in production environments.
    - Recommendation in the README.md to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI when deploying the application in a production-like setting.
    - Example configuration or documentation on how to deploy the application using a production-ready WSGI server.
- Preconditions:
    - A user naively follows the README.md instructions to run the application.
    - The user deploys the application to a production or production-like environment intended for public access.
    - The application is run using the `flask run` command, thus utilizing the Flask development server.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The `app.py` file contains the core Flask application code, which is a simple dice rolling application. There are no inherent vulnerabilities in the application code itself that are directly related to the Flask development server misconfiguration.
    - The `Dockerfile` uses `CMD [ "opentelemetry-instrument", "--service_name", "dice-server", "flask", "run", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080" ]` which also uses `flask run` to start the application within the Docker container. This reinforces the usage of the development server even in the Docker deployment scenario.
    - The vulnerability is introduced by the README.md instructions and the Dockerfile configuration that implicitly encourage the use of `flask run`, without explicitly warning against its production use.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the application to a publicly accessible server using the instructions in the README.md, specifically using `flask run -p 8080`.
    2. Access the application through a web browser or using `curl` to confirm it is running and accessible (e.g., access `/rolldice`).
    3. Using a separate machine or network, attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities of the Flask development server. This could include:
        - **Information Disclosure:** Try to access Werkzeug debugger console (if enabled, though not by default, but worth checking default configurations for development server). Attempt to trigger exceptions to see if debug information is revealed.
        - **Denial of Service:** Send a large number of requests to the server to see if the development server, which is not designed for high concurrency, can be easily overwhelmed, leading to a denial of service.
        - **Header Injection/Bypass:** Test for header injection vulnerabilities, although less likely to be directly related to the development server itself, it's a common web application vulnerability to check in conjunction.
    4. Observe the server's behavior and logs for any signs of successful exploitation or vulnerability exposure.
    5. Document the steps and results, demonstrating the potential for exploiting the Flask development server in a production deployment scenario based on the project's instructions.
