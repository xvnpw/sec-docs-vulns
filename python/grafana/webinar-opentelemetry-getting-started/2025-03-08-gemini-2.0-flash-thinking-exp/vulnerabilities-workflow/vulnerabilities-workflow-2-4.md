* Vulnerability Name: Insecure Logging and Lack of Input Validation in Player Parameter
* Description:
    - The `/rolldice` endpoint in the Flask application accepts a `player` parameter via HTTP GET request.
    - The application retrieves this `player` parameter using `request.args.get('player', default=None, type=str)`.
    - The application then logs this `player` parameter directly into the application logs using `logger.warning("%s is rolling the dice: %s", player, result)` or `logger.warning("Anonymous player is rolling the dice: %s", result)` if the player parameter is not provided.
    - There is no input validation or sanitization performed on the `player` parameter before it is logged.
    - An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious `player` parameter, injecting arbitrary text into the log messages.
    - For example, an attacker could send a request like `http://localhost:8080/rolldice?player=ATTACKER_CONTROLLED_STRING`.
    - This would result in a log entry containing the attacker-controlled string.
* Impact:
    - Log Injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary content into the application's logs.
    - Log Forging: By injecting specific log entries, an attacker could potentially forge log data, making it harder to detect malicious activity or manipulate log-based security monitoring and alerting systems.
    - Information Leakage (in certain scenarios): If logs are inadvertently exposed or accessed by unauthorized parties, injected malicious content could mislead or confuse those reviewing logs. In more complex logging pipelines, injected data could potentially be misinterpreted by log processing systems leading to unintended actions.
* Vulnerability Rank: Medium
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application directly logs the user-provided `player` parameter without any sanitization or validation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement input validation to sanitize or reject potentially malicious input in the `player` parameter. This could involve limiting the character set, length, or format of the `player` parameter.
    - Secure Logging Practices:  Consider using structured logging instead of directly embedding user input into log messages. If user input must be logged, ensure it is properly sanitized and consider encoding it to prevent injection attacks.
* Preconditions:
    - The Flask application must be running and accessible over the network.
    - Logging must be enabled and logs must be accessible for observation (e.g., to a file, console, or logging system).
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/app.py`
    ```python
    from random import randint
    from flask import Flask, request
    import logging

    app = Flask(__name__)
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    @app.route("/rolldice")
    def roll_dice():
        player = request.args.get('player', default=None, type=str) # [Vulnerable Code]: Retrieves player parameter without validation
        result = str(roll())
        if player:
            logger.warning("%s is rolling the dice: %s", player, result) # [Vulnerable Code]: Logs player parameter directly
        else:
            logger.warning("Anonymous player is rolling the dice: %s", result) # [Vulnerable Code]: Logs default message
        return result

    def roll():
        return randint(1, 6)
    ```
    - The code directly retrieves the `player` parameter from the request and uses it in the log message without any checks. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary strings into the logs.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the Flask application as described in the `README.md` or using the `Dockerfile`.
    2. Access the `/rolldice` endpoint with a crafted `player` parameter designed to inject a log message. For example, send the following HTTP GET request: `http://localhost:8080/rolldice?player=INJECTED_LOG_MESSAGE`
    3. Examine the application logs. The exact method to examine logs depends on the deployment environment. If running locally, logs might be printed to the console. If using Docker, you can check the Docker container logs.
    4. Verify that the log output contains the injected string `INJECTED_LOG_MESSAGE` within the log message, demonstrating successful log injection. For example, you might see a log line similar to: `[timestamp] WARNING app: INJECTED_LOG_MESSAGE is rolling the dice: [dice_result]`
