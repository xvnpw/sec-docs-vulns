## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities, detailing their descriptions, impacts, ranks, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and security test cases.

### 1. Grafana Cloud API Token Exposure via Environment Variables

- **Description:**
    1. A user follows the instructions in the `README.md` to deploy the sample application.
    2. As part of the setup, the user is instructed to obtain a Grafana Cloud API token and set it as an environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`.
    3. If the user deploys this application in a publicly accessible environment (e.g., a public cloud server) without securing environment variables, the API token becomes potentially exposed.
    4. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the environment where the application is running (e.g., through server misconfiguration, other vulnerabilities, or insider access) can retrieve the Grafana Cloud API token.
    5. The attacker can then use this stolen API token to authenticate and access the victim's Grafana Cloud account, potentially gaining access to monitoring data, dashboards, and other Grafana Cloud resources.

- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to the victim's Grafana Cloud account.
    - Potential compromise of sensitive monitoring data sent to Grafana Cloud.
    - Ability for the attacker to manipulate Grafana dashboards, alerts, and monitoring configurations within the victim's Grafana Cloud account.
    - Potential for further malicious activities within the Grafana Cloud environment depending on the permissions associated with the compromised API token.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code and documentation do not include any mitigations for the risk of API token exposure through environment variables. The `README.md` actually encourages setting the API token as an environment variable without sufficient warning about the security implications for production deployments.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** The `README.md` should include a prominent security warning about the risks of exposing Grafana Cloud API tokens via environment variables in publicly accessible environments. It should emphasize that environment variables are generally not a secure way to store secrets in production.
    - **Guidance on Secure Secret Management:** The documentation should guide users towards more secure methods of managing Grafana Cloud API tokens, especially for production deployments. This could include:
        - Using dedicated secret management tools or services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).
        - Loading API tokens from configuration files that are not publicly accessible.
        - Using environment variable encryption or other techniques to protect secrets at rest and in transit.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege Recommendation:**  Users should be advised to create Grafana Cloud API tokens with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the potential damage if a token is compromised.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The sample application is deployed in a publicly accessible environment.
    - The user follows the `README.md` instructions and sets the Grafana Cloud API token as an environment variable (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`).
    - The environment where the application is deployed is not properly secured, allowing potential attackers to access environment variables.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`README.md`**: The instructions in the "Run the sample application via Docker" and "Run the sample application locally" sections explicitly guide users to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable with the Grafana Cloud API token.
    ```markdown
    ```sh
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20..."
    ```
    ```sh
    docker run \
      -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf" \
      -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/otlp"
      -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20..." \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      grafana-otel-webinar
    ```
    This documentation suggests a configuration method that is insecure for production environments without providing sufficient warnings or alternative secure practices.
    - **`app.py` and `Dockerfile`**: These files do not directly handle the API token. The vulnerability is introduced by the deployment instructions and the inherent insecurity of environment variables for sensitive secrets in publicly accessible systems.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy the Application:** Deploy the Docker image built from the provided `Dockerfile` to a publicly accessible server (e.g., an EC2 instance or a similar cloud VM). When running the Docker container, include the `-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="<YOUR_GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_TOKEN>"` parameter, replacing `<YOUR_GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_TOKEN>` with a valid Grafana Cloud API token. Ensure port 8080 is publicly accessible.
    2. **Access the Deployed Application:** Verify that the application is running by accessing the `/rolldice` endpoint (e.g., `http://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>:8080/rolldice`) from an external network.
    3. **Attempt to Access Environment Variables (Simulated Attack):** In a real attack scenario, an attacker would attempt to gain access to the server's environment variables through various means (e.g., exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or server, social engineering, or insider access). For the purpose of this test case, we will simulate gaining local access to the running container's environment.
    4. **Inspect Docker Container Environment:**  On the server where the Docker container is running, use Docker commands to inspect the environment variables of the running container. For example:
       ```sh
       docker ps # to get the container ID
       docker inspect <CONTAINER_ID> | grep OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
       ```
    5. **Extract API Token:** The output of the `docker inspect` command will reveal the value of the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable, which contains the Grafana Cloud API token.
    6. **Verify API Token Validity:** Use the extracted Grafana Cloud API token to authenticate against the Grafana Cloud API. For example, use `curl` to make a request to a Grafana Cloud API endpoint that requires authentication, including the extracted token in the `Authorization` header.
       ```sh
       curl -H "Authorization: <EXTRACTED_API_TOKEN>" "https://<YOUR_GRAFANA_CLOUD_INSTANCE>.grafana.net/api/datasources" # Replace with a valid Grafana Cloud API endpoint
       ```
    7. **Confirm Unauthorized Access:** If the API request is successful and returns data from your Grafana Cloud instance, it confirms that the extracted API token is valid and can be used to access your Grafana Cloud account. This demonstrates the vulnerability of exposing the API token through environment variables in a publicly accessible environment.


### 2. Flask Development Server Misconfiguration

- **Description:** The project's README.md instructs users to run the Flask application using the command `flask run`. This command starts the Flask development server, which is explicitly warned against being used in production environments in the official Flask documentation. The development server is designed for debugging and development purposes and is not hardened for security or performance in production. An attacker could potentially exploit known vulnerabilities inherent in the Flask development server if the application is naively deployed to a production-like environment following the README instructions. This includes potential for information disclosure, denial of service, and other attacks due to the lack of security features and performance optimizations in the development server.

- **Impact:** High. If an attacker successfully exploits vulnerabilities in the Flask development server, they could gain unauthorized access to application data, manipulate the application, or cause a denial of service. This is particularly critical if the application is deployed in a production or production-like environment where sensitive data or critical services might be exposed.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The README.md implicitly suggests this is a sample application for demonstration purposes and a tutorial, not intended for production use. However, this is not an explicit security mitigation and relies on the user's understanding of deployment best practices.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Explicit warning in the README.md** against using `flask run` in production environments.
    - **Recommendation in the README.md** to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI when deploying the application in a production-like setting.
    - **Example configuration or documentation** on how to deploy the application using a production-ready WSGI server.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A user naively follows the README.md instructions to run the application.
    - The user deploys the application to a production or production-like environment intended for public access.
    - The application is run using the `flask run` command, thus utilizing the Flask development server.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `app.py` file contains the core Flask application code, which is a simple dice rolling application. There are no inherent vulnerabilities in the application code itself that are directly related to the Flask development server misconfiguration.
    - The `Dockerfile` uses `CMD [ "opentelemetry-instrument", "--service_name", "dice-server", "flask", "run", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080" ]` which also uses `flask run` to start the application within the Docker container. This reinforces the usage of the development server even in the Docker deployment scenario.
    - The vulnerability is introduced by the README.md instructions and the Dockerfile configuration that implicitly encourage the use of `flask run`, without explicitly warning against its production use.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application to a publicly accessible server using the instructions in the README.md, specifically using `flask run -p 8080`.
    2. Access the application through a web browser or using `curl` to confirm it is running and accessible (e.g., access `/rolldice`).
    3. Using a separate machine or network, attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities of the Flask development server. This could include:
        - **Information Disclosure:** Try to access Werkzeug debugger console (if enabled, though not by default, but worth checking default configurations for development server). Attempt to trigger exceptions to see if debug information is revealed.
        - **Denial of Service:** Send a large number of requests to the server to see if the development server, which is not designed for high concurrency, can be easily overwhelmed, leading to a denial of service.
        - **Header Injection/Bypass:** Test for header injection vulnerabilities, although less likely to be directly related to the development server itself, it's a common web application vulnerability to check in conjunction.
    4. Observe the server's behavior and logs for any signs of successful exploitation or vulnerability exposure.
    5. Document the steps and results, demonstrating the potential for exploiting the Flask development server in a production deployment scenario based on the project's instructions.
