- Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure through Grafana Bug Report
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the `report.md` file generated by the script. This file is intended to be publicly accessible as it is generated in the `reports` directory within the repository.
    2. The attacker reads the `report.md` file, which lists Grafana versions and their corresponding known bugs extracted from Grafana's GitHub issues.
    3. By analyzing the report, the attacker can identify Grafana instances running specific versions that are documented to have vulnerabilities.
    4. Armed with this information, the attacker can then focus their efforts on targeting Grafana instances running these vulnerable versions, significantly increasing the efficiency of potential attacks.
- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure**: The `report.md` file publicly exposes information about known Grafana vulnerabilities categorized by affected versions.
    - **Targeted Attacks**: Attackers can use this information to identify and target Grafana instances running specific vulnerable versions. This targeted approach increases the likelihood of successful exploits, as attackers can focus on known weaknesses.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no mitigations implemented within the project itself to prevent this information disclosure. The script is designed to generate and output this report, making the vulnerability inherent to its functionality.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Restrict Report Accessibility**: The most effective mitigation would be to prevent public access to the generated `report.md` file. This could involve:
        - Not hosting the `report.md` file publicly at all.
        - Implementing access controls to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - **Anonymize Version Information**: If the report needs to be publicly accessible for broader informational purposes (less likely given the security context), the version-specific details should be removed or significantly generalized. Instead of listing specific vulnerable versions, the report could be made more generic, focusing on bug categories or general areas of concern without directly linking them to exploitable Grafana versions.
- Preconditions:
    - **Publicly Accessible Report**: The primary precondition is that the generated `report.md` file must be accessible to external, unauthorized users. This is the default behavior if the `reports` directory is exposed in a publicly accessible web server or repository.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`main.py` Script**: The Python script `main.py` is the core component that drives the report generation. It fetches issues from the Grafana GitHub repository using the GitHub GraphQL API.
    2. **Issue Filtering and Version Extraction**: The script specifically filters issues labeled `type/bug` and extracts Grafana versions from issue bodies using regular expressions (e.g., `re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', line)`). This extracted version information is crucial for categorizing bugs by Grafana version.
    3. **Report Generation**: The script then organizes these issues by version and generates markdown reports (`report.md`, `open_report.md`, `closed_report.md`). These reports, particularly `all_report.md`, list vulnerabilities grouped by Grafana versions.
    4. **Vulnerability Trigger**: The vulnerability is not triggered by a specific code flaw but is a direct consequence of the script's intended functionality. The script is designed to aggregate and present version-specific vulnerability information in a publicly readable format (`report.md`).

    ```python
    def organize_issues_by_version():
        # get issues from issues.json
        with open('issues_with_found_in.json', 'r') as file:
            issues = json.load(file)

        issues_by_version = {}
        # ... [rest of the code] ...

        for issue in issues:
            version = issue['found_in']
            # ... [rest of the code] ...

            if version:
                if version not in issues_by_version:
                    issues_by_version[version] = []
                issues_by_version[version].append({
                    'url': issue['url'],
                    'title': issue['title'],
                    'fixed_in': issue['fixed_in'], # added this to the dict to make it easier to find the issue in GitHub
                    'state': issue['state'],
                })
        # ... [rest of the code] ...
    ```

    - The `organize_issues_by_version` function is key, as it groups the issues specifically by the `found_in` version, which is then used to generate the version-categorized reports.
    - The script's design to create version-specific reports directly leads to the information disclosure vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Generate the `report.md` file by running the `main.py` script. Ensure you have set the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable for the script to function correctly.
        - Host the generated `reports/all_report.md` file on a publicly accessible web server or within a public GitHub repository (as is the project's default structure).
    2. **Action**:
        - As an external attacker, use a web browser or `curl` to access the URL where `report.md` is hosted.
    3. **Expected Result**:
        - The attacker should be able to successfully download or view the `report.md` file.
        - Upon inspecting the content of `report.md`, the attacker should find a categorized list of Grafana bugs, grouped by affected Grafana versions. Each bug entry should include the Grafana version(s) it affects, the bug title, and a link to the corresponding GitHub issue.
    4. **Success**:
        - If the attacker can successfully access and read the `report.md` file and extract information about Grafana versions known to have bugs from the report's content, then the information disclosure vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that an attacker can easily utilize the generated report to identify potentially vulnerable Grafana instances based on their version.
