### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Misleading Grafana Bug Report Injection
- Description:
  1. An attacker creates a GitHub account and gains the ability to submit issues to the `grafana/grafana` issue tracker. This is generally open to the public.
  2. The attacker crafts a misleading or entirely fabricated bug report.
  3. The attacker labels this issue with `type/bug`.
  4. Within the issue body, the attacker includes a line starting with `Grafana:` followed by a specific Grafana version number (e.g., `Grafana: 11.4.0`).
  5. The attacker submits the issue to the `grafana/grafana` issue tracker.
  6. The Python script `main.py` is executed to fetch and analyze GitHub issues.
  7. The script, as designed, retrieves issues labeled `type/bug` and filters them based on the presence of a line starting with `Grafana:`.
  8. Due to the lack of input validation, the attacker's misleading bug report is included in the data processed by the script.
  9. The script groups issues by the Grafana version extracted from the issue body.
  10. The generated report (`report.md`) includes the attacker's fabricated bug report under the falsely specified Grafana version, misleading users into believing that version of Grafana has a bug described in the fake report.
- Impact:
  - The generated Grafana bug report becomes untrustworthy and misleading.
  - Users relying on this report may falsely believe certain Grafana versions are affected by non-existent bugs.
  - This could damage the reputation of specific Grafana versions or the overall Grafana project.
  - Attackers could use this to spread misinformation about Grafana's stability or security, potentially impacting user adoption or confidence.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - There are no mitigations implemented in the provided project. The script directly processes and includes information from GitHub issues without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation:** Implement validation to check the authenticity and trustworthiness of the data source (GitHub issues). This could involve:
    - Verifying the author's reputation or permissions within the Grafana project.
    - Employing more sophisticated analysis of the issue content to detect fabricated reports (e.g., anomaly detection, natural language processing to assess report coherence).
    - Cross-referencing bug reports with other trusted sources of Grafana vulnerability information.
  - **Data Sanitization:** Implement sanitization of the extracted Grafana version and issue descriptions to prevent the injection of malicious content into the report, although this will not prevent misleading information from being presented.
  - **Data Source Authentication/Authorization:** Explore options to use authenticated access to the GitHub API to potentially filter or prioritize issues from trusted contributors or project members. However, public issues are inherently open to contributions from anyone.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker has a GitHub account and the ability to create issues in the publicly accessible `grafana/grafana` issue tracker.
  - The attacker understands the basic functionality of the Python script and how it extracts data from GitHub issues.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/main.py`
    - Function: `fetch_github_issues`
      ```python
      query = '''
      query {
          repository(owner: "%s", name: "%s") {
              issues(labels: ["type/bug"], first: 100, orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: DESC}) {
                  # ...
                  nodes {
                      url
                      title
                      body
                      state
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ''' % (owner, repo_name)
      ```
      This function constructs a GraphQL query to fetch issues labeled `type/bug`. It retrieves the `url`, `title`, and `body` of each issue.
    - Function: `find_grafana_version`
      ```python
      for issue in issues:
          body = issue['body']
          lines = body.split('\n')
          found_in = None
          found_in_line = None

          for line in lines:
              version_match = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', line)
              if 'Grafana:' in line or 'Grafana Version:' in line or 'Grafana version:' in line:
                  version_match = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', line)
                  if version_match:
                      found_in = version_match.group()
                  else:
                      found_in_line = line
                  break  # no need to go through the rest of the lines
      ```
      This function iterates through the fetched issues and extracts the Grafana version by searching for lines containing "Grafana:" or similar and then using a regex `\d+\.\d+\.\d+` to find a version number. It directly uses the extracted version without any validation.
    - Function: `organize_issues_by_version`
      ```python
      for issue in issues:
          version = issue['found_in']
          # ...
          if version:
              if version not in issues_by_version:
                  issues_by_version[version] = []
              issues_by_version[version].append({
                  'url': issue['url'],
                  'title': issue['title'],
                  'fixed_in': issue['fixed_in'],
                  'state': issue['state'],
              })
      ```
      This function organizes the issues by version, directly using the `found_in` version extracted in the previous step.
    - Function: `create_report_md`
      ```python
      for version in sorted_versions:
          sorted_issues = sorted(issues[version], key=lambda x: x['state'], reverse=True)
          printed = 0
          for index, issue in enumerate(sorted_issues):
              # ...
              if issue['fixed_in'] != None:
                  report_file.write(f'- [{issue["title"]}]({issue["url"]}) (Fixed in {issue["fixed_in"]})\n')
              else:
                  report_file.write(f'- [{issue["title"]}]({issue["url"]})\n')
      ```
      This function generates the markdown report, directly embedding the issue title and URL into the report based on the grouped and filtered issues.

      ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Ensure you have access to the `grafana/grafana` GitHub issue tracker with a GitHub account.
     - Have the Python script `main.py` and its dependencies installed and configured (including `GH_TOKEN` environment variable if needed for rate limits).
     - Have a local directory set up for the script to run and generate reports.
  2. **Create a Fake Bug Report:**
     - Go to the `grafana/grafana` issue tracker on GitHub (`https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues`).
     - Click on "New issue".
     - Choose "Bug report" template (or create a blank issue if templates are not enforced).
     - In the issue title, enter a misleading title like "Fake Bug: Data Loss Vulnerability".
     - In the issue body, include the following content:
       ```markdown
       **Describe the bug**
       This is a fabricated bug report to demonstrate a vulnerability in the Grafana bug report generation script.

       **Grafana version:** 11.4.0

       **What happened?**
       Data loss occurs under specific conditions. (This is fake).

       **What you expected to happen?**
       No data loss. (This is fake).

       **How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):**
       (Steps to reproduce - fake steps).

       **Anything else we need to know?:**
       No.

       **Environment:**
       - Grafana version: 11.4.0 (This is the targeted version for the misleading report)
       - Data source type & version: TestData DB
       - OS: Any
       - Browser: Any

       **Config:**
       (Include Grafana configuration relevant to reproduce the bug).

       **Logs:**
       (Include Grafana server logs relevant to reproduce the bug).

       **Screenshots**
       (Add screenshots if applicable)

       **Additional context**
       This is a test bug report.
       ```
     - Label the issue with `type/bug`.
     - Submit the issue. Note the issue URL for verification.
  3. **Run the Python Script:**
     - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
     - Execute the script: `python main.py --no-cache` (using `--no-cache` to ensure fresh data is fetched).
  4. **Verify the Report:**
     - After the script execution, open the `reports/all_report.md` file.
     - Search for the section `## 11.4.0`.
     - Under the `### OPEN` or `### CLOSED` subsection (depending on the default state of GitHub issues), check if your fake bug report title "Fake Bug: Data Loss Vulnerability" is listed.
     - If the fake bug report is listed under version `11.4.0`, the vulnerability is confirmed.
  5. **Cleanup (Optional):**
     - Delete the fake bug report from the `grafana/grafana` issue tracker to avoid confusion.

This test case demonstrates that a misleading bug report can be successfully injected into the generated Grafana bug report by exploiting the lack of input validation in the Python script.
