### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via Grafana Version Report
- Description:
    - The script aggregates Grafana bug reports from GitHub.
    - It extracts and groups bug reports based on affected Grafana versions.
    - The script generates a markdown report (`report.md`) listing Grafana versions and associated bug reports.
    - An attacker can access this report, either by directly accessing the generated file if publicly hosted, or by tricking an authorized user into sharing it.
    - The report reveals specific Grafana versions known to have bugs (which could include security vulnerabilities).
    - Attackers can use this information to identify Grafana instances running vulnerable versions.
    - Once vulnerable versions are identified, attackers can research publicly available exploits targeting those specific Grafana versions.
    - Finally, attackers can target Grafana instances running the disclosed vulnerable versions with the identified exploits.
- Impact:
    - Exposure of vulnerable Grafana versions allows attackers to focus their efforts on systems running those versions.
    - Successful exploitation of identified Grafana instances could lead to:
        - Unauthorized access to Grafana dashboards and data.
        - Data breaches, depending on the privileges of the exploited Grafana instance and the data it can access.
        - Potential disruption of Grafana services.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script is designed to create and output this report. There is no access control or mitigation implemented within the script itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to the generated reports. The reports should not be publicly accessible and should only be available to authorized personnel. This could involve storing reports in a private location, requiring authentication to access them, or using other access restriction methods.
    - **Security Warning:** Add a clear and prominent security warning in the `README.md` file and any other relevant documentation. This warning should explicitly state the information disclosure risk associated with publicly sharing the generated reports and advise users to keep the reports private and secure.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker gains access to a generated report (e.g., `all_report.md`, `open_report.md`, `closed_report.md`). This could be achieved if the report is accidentally or intentionally made publicly accessible.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The script's primary function, as detailed in `main.py`, is to fetch bug reports and organize them by Grafana version.
    - The `fetch_github_issues` function retrieves bug reports from GitHub's API.
    - The `find_grafana_version` function parses the issue bodies to extract Grafana version information.
    - The `organize_issues_by_version` function groups the issues by extracted versions.
    - The `create_report_md` function generates the markdown reports (`all_report.md`, `open_report.md`, `closed_report.md`) containing the version-grouped bug lists.

    ```python
    def create_report_md(showClosed=True, showOpen=True, filename='report.md'):
        # ... [Code to generate markdown report] ...
        with open(f'reports/{filename}', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as report_file: # Line creating the report file
            # ... [Code to write report content] ...
            for version in sorted_versions:
                # ... [Code to iterate through versions] ...
                for index, issue in enumerate(sorted_issues):
                    # ... [Code to filter issues based on state] ...
                    report_file.write(f'- [{issue["title"]}]({issue["url"]})\n') # Line writing issue details to report
                    # ... [Code to write stats] ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability stems from the intended functionality of these functions, specifically `create_report_md`, which compiles and outputs the sensitive version information into a readable report. The code itself doesn't introduce a typical code-level vulnerability like injection or buffer overflow, but it facilitates information disclosure by design.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Assume you have a publicly accessible instance of the project where the script is run and the reports are generated and hosted (e.g., a publicly accessible web server hosting the `reports` directory).
    2. **Attacker Access:** As an external attacker, use a web browser to access the publicly available `all_report.md` file (or any of the generated reports). For example, if the project is hosted at `http://example.com`, access `http://example.com/reports/all_report.md`.
    3. **Review Report:** Examine the content of the `all_report.md` report. Notice the sections organized by Grafana versions, listing bug reports associated with each version.
    4. **Identify Vulnerable Versions:** Identify several Grafana versions listed in the report (e.g., 11.4.0, 11.3.2, etc.).
    5. **Vulnerability Research:** For one or more of the identified Grafana versions, search online for known security vulnerabilities or CVEs. Use search terms like "Grafana 11.4.0 vulnerabilities" or "CVE for Grafana 11.3.2".
    6. **Exploit Search:** If vulnerabilities are found, search for publicly available exploits or proof-of-concept code that targets those vulnerabilities.
    7. **Target Vulnerable Instances:** If you have access to information about Grafana instances (e.g., through Shodan, Censys, or other reconnaissance methods), filter for instances that may be running the identified vulnerable versions.
    8. **Attempt Exploitation (Ethical Hacking/Proof of Concept - Do not perform on production systems without permission):** On a Grafana instance you control or have explicit permission to test, attempt to use the identified exploits to gain unauthorized access or demonstrate the vulnerability's impact.
    9. **Verification:** Success in exploiting a Grafana instance running a version listed in the report confirms the information disclosure vulnerability and its potential impact.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage the publicly available report to identify and potentially exploit vulnerable Grafana instances.
