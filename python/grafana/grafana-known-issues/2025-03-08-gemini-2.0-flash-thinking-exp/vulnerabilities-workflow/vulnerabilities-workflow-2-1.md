### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via Exposed Grafana Bug Report

- Description:
    1. The Python script `main.py` fetches bug reports from the Grafana GitHub repository and generates a report file (e.g., `all_report.md`, `open_report.md`, `closed_report.md`) listing Grafana versions affected by known bugs.
    2. This report is stored within the `/code/reports/` directory of the project.
    3. If the `/code/reports/` directory or the generated report files are made publicly accessible (e.g., through misconfiguration of a web server hosting these files, or unintentional public sharing of the directory), an attacker can access and download these files.
    4. By analyzing the content of the report file, an attacker can identify specific Grafana versions that are vulnerable to known bugs.
    5. The attacker can then target Grafana instances running these identified vulnerable versions with publicly known web-based exploits that are specific to those Grafana versions.

- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of information about vulnerable Grafana versions running in an organization.
    - **Increased Attack Surface:**  Attackers can use the report to efficiently identify and target Grafana instances susceptible to known exploits, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise of the targeted Grafana instances.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided project does not implement any mitigations to prevent unauthorized access to the generated report files.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Storage:** Implement secure storage for the generated report files, ensuring they are not placed in publicly accessible directories.
    - **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to the generated report files to authorized personnel only. This could involve storing the reports in a private location and using authentication and authorization to control access.
    - **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Provide clear instructions in the documentation (e.g., README) on secure deployment practices, emphasizing the importance of protecting the generated report files and the `/code/reports/` directory from public access.

- Preconditions:
    1. The `main.py` script must be executed to generate the Grafana bug report files.
    2. The `/code/reports/` directory or the generated report files within it must be inadvertently exposed to public access.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/main.py`**
    ```python
    def create_report_md(showClosed=True, showOpen=True, filename='report.md'):
        # ...
        with open(f'reports/{filename}', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as report_file:
            # ... report content generation ...
    ```
    - The `create_report_md` function is responsible for generating the report files.
    - It uses `open(f'reports/{filename}', 'w', encoding='utf-8')` to create and write to the report file.
    - The filename is constructed using the `filename` parameter, which is controlled by the `main` function when calling `create_report_md`. The default path is `reports/report.md` or `reports/{filename}`.
    - **Vulnerability:** The code directly saves the report files into the `/reports/` subdirectory within the project's code directory. There is no explicit logic to restrict access to this directory or the files created within it. If the deployment environment makes the `/code/reports/` directory publicly accessible, the generated reports will be exposed.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        -  Assume you have a publicly accessible instance where the project code is deployed. For example, you could deploy the `/code` directory to a web server that serves static files.  Let's assume the `/code` directory is accessible at `https://example.com/code/`.
    2. **Generate Report:**
        - Run the `main.py` script in the deployed environment to generate the report files. This will create files like `all_report.md`, `open_report.md`, and `closed_report.md` in the `/code/reports/` directory.
    3. **Access Report File:**
        - As an external attacker, attempt to access the generated report file through a web browser by navigating to the expected URL. For example, try to access `https://example.com/code/reports/all_report.md`.
    4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - If you can successfully access and view the content of `all_report.md` (or any other generated report file) in your browser, the vulnerability is confirmed. The report content will reveal a list of Grafana versions and associated bug details, which can be used for malicious purposes.
