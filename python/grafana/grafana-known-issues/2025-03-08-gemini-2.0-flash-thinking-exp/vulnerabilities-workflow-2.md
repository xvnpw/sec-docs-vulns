## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via Publicly Accessible Grafana Bug Report

- Description:
    1. The Python script `main.py` fetches bug reports from the Grafana GitHub repository, specifically issues labeled `type/bug`.
    2. It extracts Grafana version information from the issue bodies.
    3. The script generates a markdown report (`report.md`, `all_report.md`, `open_report.md`) listing Grafana versions and associated bug reports. This report is stored in the `/code/reports/` directory.
    4. If the `/code/reports/` directory or the generated report files are made publicly accessible (e.g., via web server misconfiguration or public repository hosting), an attacker can access and download these reports.
    5. By analyzing the report, an attacker can identify specific Grafana versions that are known to have bugs, which may include security vulnerabilities.
    6. Armed with this information, attackers can research publicly available exploits targeting those specific Grafana versions.
    7. Finally, attackers can target Grafana instances running the disclosed vulnerable versions with the identified exploits, increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks.

- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure:** Public exposure of a report detailing Grafana versions known to have bugs, including potential security vulnerabilities.
    - **Increased Attack Surface & Targeted Attacks:** Attackers can leverage the report to efficiently identify and target Grafana instances running vulnerable versions. This targeted approach increases the likelihood of successful exploits, potentially leading to:
        - Unauthorized access to Grafana dashboards and sensitive data.
        - Data breaches, depending on the privileges of the exploited Grafana instance.
        - Potential disruption of Grafana services.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project, by design, generates the report and places it within the `/code/reports/` directory without any built-in access controls or security measures to prevent public access.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Storage & Access Control:** Implement secure storage for the generated report files, ensuring they are not placed in publicly accessible directories. Access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict access to the reports to authorized personnel only. This could involve storing reports in a private location, requiring authentication to access them, or using other access restriction methods.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Add a clear and prominent security warning in the `README.md` file and any other relevant documentation. This warning should explicitly state the information disclosure risk associated with publicly sharing the generated reports and advise users to keep the reports private and secure.

- Preconditions:
    1. The `main.py` script must be executed to generate the Grafana bug report files.
    2. The `/code/reports/` directory or the generated report files within it must be inadvertently or intentionally exposed to public access, for example by hosting the `/code` directory on a public web server or within a public code repository without access restrictions.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/main.py`**: The `main.py` script is responsible for fetching Grafana bug reports from GitHub and generating the markdown reports.
    2. **`create_report_md` function**: This function generates the report files.
        ```python
        def create_report_md(showClosed=True, showOpen=True, filename='report.md'):
            # ...
            with open(f'reports/{filename}', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as report_file:
                # ... report content generation ...
        ```
        - The function uses `open(f'reports/{filename}', 'w', encoding='utf-8')` to create and write the report file directly into the `reports/` subdirectory within the project's code directory.
        - The filename is configurable, but the default and intended behavior is to save reports in the `reports/` directory.
    3. **Intended Functionality as Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is not due to a typical code-level flaw, but rather arises from the script's intended functionality of aggregating and presenting version-specific vulnerability information in a publicly readable format within the `/reports/` directory. The code lacks any logic to prevent public access to this directory or the generated reports.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        -  Assume the `/code` directory, including the `reports` subdirectory, is deployed to a publicly accessible web server, for example at `https://example.com/code/`.
        - Run the `main.py` script in the deployed environment to generate the report files in the `/code/reports/` directory.
    2. **Access Report File:**
        - As an external attacker, attempt to access the generated report file through a web browser by navigating to the expected URL. For example, access `https://example.com/code/reports/all_report.md`.
    3. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - If you can successfully access and view the content of `all_report.md` (or any other generated report file) in your browser, the vulnerability is confirmed.
        - Examine the report content. It should reveal a list of Grafana versions and associated bug details, categorized by version, which can be used to identify potentially vulnerable Grafana instances.
    4. **Vulnerability Exploitation (Illustrative, Ethical Hacking Context):**
        - Identify a Grafana version listed in the report.
        - Search for publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits for that specific Grafana version.
        - If you have access to a test Grafana instance running the identified vulnerable version (with explicit permission), attempt to use the found exploits to demonstrate unauthorized access or other impacts. Success here further validates the severity of the information disclosure.

### Vulnerability Name: Misleading Grafana Bug Report Injection

- Description:
  1. An attacker, with a GitHub account, submits a new issue to the public `grafana/grafana` issue tracker.
  2. The attacker crafts a misleading or fabricated bug report, designed to inject false information into the generated bug report.
  3. The attacker labels this issue with `type/bug` to ensure it's processed by the script.
  4. Within the issue body, the attacker includes a line starting with `Grafana:` followed by a specific Grafana version number (e.g., `Grafana: 11.4.0`). This line is crucial for the script's version extraction logic.
  5. The Python script `main.py` is executed, fetching and analyzing GitHub issues.
  6. The script retrieves issues labeled `type/bug` and extracts Grafana versions based on lines starting with "Grafana:", without proper input validation or source trustworthiness checks.
  7. The attacker's misleading bug report is processed and the fabricated version is extracted.
  8. The generated report (`report.md`) includes the attacker's fabricated bug report under the falsely specified Grafana version, misleading users into believing that version of Grafana has a bug described in the fake report.

- Impact:
  - **Data Integrity Compromise:** The generated Grafana bug report becomes untrustworthy and misleading due to the injection of fabricated bug reports.
  - **Misinformation & Reputation Damage:** Users relying on this report may falsely believe certain Grafana versions are affected by non-existent bugs. This could damage the reputation of specific Grafana versions or the overall Grafana project and erode user confidence.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The script directly processes and includes information from GitHub issues without any validation or sanitization of the input data.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation & Data Source Trustworthiness:** Implement validation to check the authenticity and trustworthiness of the data source (GitHub issues).  This could involve:
    - Analyzing the issue author's reputation or permissions within the Grafana project.
    - Employing more sophisticated analysis of issue content to detect fabricated reports (e.g., anomaly detection, natural language processing to assess report coherence).
    - Cross-referencing bug reports with other trusted sources of Grafana vulnerability information, although fully automated validation of public GitHub issues is challenging.
  - **Data Sanitization:** Implement sanitization of the extracted Grafana version and issue descriptions to prevent the injection of potentially malicious content into the report (e.g., HTML injection), although this will not prevent misleading information itself.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker has a GitHub account and the ability to create issues in the publicly accessible `grafana/grafana` issue tracker.
  - The attacker understands the basic functionality of the Python script and how it extracts data from GitHub issues, specifically the version extraction mechanism.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/main.py`
    - Function: `fetch_github_issues`: This function retrieves issues from GitHub based on the `type/bug` label.
    - Function: `find_grafana_version`:
      ```python
      def find_grafana_version(issues):
          # ...
          for issue in issues:
              body = issue['body']
              lines = body.split('\n')
              # ...
              for line in lines:
                  if 'Grafana:' in line or 'Grafana Version:' in line or 'Grafana version:' in line:
                      version_match = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', line)
                      if version_match:
                          found_in = version_match.group()
                          # ...
                          break
      ```
      - This function iterates through issue bodies and naively extracts the first version number found on a line containing "Grafana:", "Grafana Version:", or "Grafana version:". It relies on simple string matching and regular expressions without any validation of the context or source of this information.
    - Function: `organize_issues_by_version` and `create_report_md`: These functions use the extracted `found_in` version to group and report issues, directly incorporating potentially fabricated version information into the final report.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Access to the `grafana/grafana` GitHub issue tracker with a GitHub account.
     - The Python script `main.py` and its dependencies installed and configured.
  2. **Create a Fake Bug Report on GitHub:**
     - Create a new issue in the `grafana/grafana` repository with a misleading title like "Fake Bug Report: Critical Vulnerability".
     - In the issue body, include a fabricated bug description and crucially include a line like `Grafana: 12.0.0` (or any version you want to falsely associate with the fake bug). Label the issue as `type/bug`.
     - Submit the issue.
  3. **Run the Python Script:**
     - Execute the `main.py` script (e.g., `python main.py --no-cache`).
  4. **Verify the Report:**
     - Open the generated `reports/all_report.md` file.
     - Search for the section corresponding to the Grafana version you used in your fake bug report (e.g., `## 12.0.0`).
     - Check if your fake bug report title is listed under this version section.
     - If the fake bug report appears under the specified version, the vulnerability is confirmed.
  5. **Cleanup (Optional):**
     - Delete the fake bug report from the `grafana/grafana` issue tracker to avoid misleading legitimate users.
