### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of GitHub API Token via Environment Variable
- **Description:**
  The github-traffic application uses a GitHub API token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) to authenticate with the GitHub API. This token is configured through an environment variable, which is commonly loaded from a `.env` file or directly set in the Docker environment. If this environment variable is exposed, for example, through a leaked `.env` file, a misconfigured environment, or other means, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the GitHub API using the leaked token.
- **Impact:**
  Unauthorized access to the GitHub API. The severity of the impact depends on the scope of the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A token with broad permissions could allow an attacker to:
    - Read private repositories.
    - Modify repository settings.
    - Create or delete repositories.
    - Access organization information.
    - Perform other actions depending on the token's scope.

  Even with a token intended for read-only access for traffic data, an attacker could potentially:
    - Gather sensitive information about the organization's repositories and activities beyond just traffic data.
    - Potentially escalate privileges if the token has broader than intended scope.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. The project documentation suggests using a `.env` file for configuration, which is a common practice but does not inherently mitigate the risk of token exposure.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Secret Management:** Implement a secure secret management solution instead of relying solely on environment variables, especially not `.env` files in version control. Examples include:
    - HashiCorp Vault
    - AWS Secrets Manager
    - Kubernetes Secrets
  - **Principle of Least Privilege for Tokens:**  Clearly document and recommend creating GitHub API tokens with the minimal necessary scope required for the application to function (ideally read-only access to repository traffic data). Specify the required scopes in the documentation.
  - **Environment Variable Security Best Practices Documentation:** Enhance the documentation to include best practices for securely handling environment variables in Docker and Kubernetes environments. Emphasize:
    - Never commit `.env` files containing secrets to version control.
    - Utilize secure secret injection methods provided by container orchestration platforms instead of relying on simple environment variables where possible.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The github-traffic application must be deployed and configured to use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for accessing the GitHub API.
  - An attacker needs to gain access to the environment where the application is running or to the configuration files (like `.env` if used insecurely) that contain the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This access could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Leaking the `.env` file (e.g., accidentally committing it to a public repository).
    - Exploiting a misconfiguration in the deployment environment that exposes environment variables.
    - Gaining unauthorized access to the server or container where the application is running.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/github-traffic.py`:
    - Line 13: `GITHUB_TOKEN = config('GITHUB_TOKEN')` - The application reads the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from environment variables using the `python-decouple` library. This is a common way to configure applications, but it introduces security risks if environment variables are not handled properly.
    - Line 15: `github = Github(GITHUB_TOKEN)` - The retrieved `GITHUB_TOKEN` is directly used to instantiate the `Github` client from the `PyGithub` library. This client is then used throughout the script to interact with the GitHub API.
    - The application logic within the `job_function` uses this `github` object to fetch repository data using API calls like `repo.get_views_traffic`, `repo.get_clones_traffic`, etc. These operations are authenticated using the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

  - **Vulnerability Flow:**
    1.  The application starts and reads the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment.
    2.  The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authenticate API requests to GitHub.
    3.  If the environment where the application runs is compromised, or if the `.env` file (if used) is exposed, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` can be easily retrieved by an attacker.
    4.  With the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the attacker can directly authenticate to the GitHub API and perform actions based on the token's permissions, potentially causing significant harm.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Deploy the `github-traffic` application locally using Docker Compose, following the instructions in the `README.md`.
     - Create a `.env` file in the `/code` directory (or project root if deploying outside Docker) and include a dummy `GITHUB_TOKEN` and other required variables like `ORG_NAME` or `USER_NAME`. For testing the vulnerability, the actual validity of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not strictly necessary initially to demonstrate exposure, but for full verification, use a real token.
     - Start the application using `docker-compose up -d`.
     - Verify the application is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8001/metrics`.

  2. **Simulate Token Exposure by Accessing Container Environment:**
     - Identify the running container name for the `traffic` service using `docker ps`. It will likely be named something like `github-traffic_traffic_1`.
     - Execute the following command to access the environment variables inside the running container:
       ```bash
       docker exec -it github-traffic_traffic_1 env
       ```
     - Examine the output for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. It should be listed along with other environment variables.

  3. **Extract and Verify Token:**
     - From the output of the previous command, manually copy the value of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
     - Use `curl` or a similar HTTP client to make a request to the GitHub API, authenticating with the extracted token. For example, to get information about the authenticated user (note: scope might limit access to certain endpoints, adjust API endpoint based on expected token scope):
       ```bash
       curl -H "Authorization: token <extracted_token>" https://api.github.com/user
       ```
       Replace `<extracted_token>` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value you extracted from the container environment.

  4. **Analyze Results:**
     - If the `curl` command to the GitHub API is successful (returns a 200 OK status code and a JSON response containing user information or other API data), it confirms that the extracted `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid and can be used to authenticate with the GitHub API.
     - This demonstrates that an attacker who gains access to the container's environment (even with limited privileges to view environment variables) can retrieve the sensitive `GITHUB_TOKEN` and potentially misuse it to access GitHub resources, confirming the vulnerability.

  5. **Cleanup:**
     - Stop and remove the Docker containers using `docker-compose down`.

This test case proves that the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, when configured via environment variables as suggested, is vulnerable to exposure if an attacker gains access to the container environment. This highlights the security risk associated with storing sensitive API tokens in environment variables without proper protection.
