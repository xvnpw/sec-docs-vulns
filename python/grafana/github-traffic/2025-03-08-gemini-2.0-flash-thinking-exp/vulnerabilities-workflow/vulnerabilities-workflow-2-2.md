- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
- Description:
    - The application exposes Prometheus metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint via HTTP on port 8001.
    - There is no authentication or authorization mechanism implemented to protect access to this endpoint.
    - If the application is deployed with port 8001 publicly accessible, any external attacker can access the `/metrics` endpoint without credentials.
    - By accessing the `/metrics` endpoint, the attacker can retrieve sensitive information about the GitHub repository traffic data collected by the application.
- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can access sensitive information exposed as Prometheus metrics. This includes:
        - Repository traffic data: views, unique views, clones, unique clones, stars for each tracked repository.
        - Top paths and referrers for each tracked repository, potentially revealing insights into user behavior and interests.
        - GitHub API rate limits: current limit and remaining requests, which might not be directly sensitive but adds to the overall information exposure.
    - This information can be used to understand the popularity and usage patterns of the monitored GitHub repositories.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application does not implement any authentication or access control for the `/metrics` endpoint.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Authentication**: Implement authentication for the `/metrics` endpoint to restrict access to authorized users only. Basic authentication, API key authentication, or integration with an identity provider could be considered.
    - **Access Control**: Implement access control mechanisms to limit access to the `/metrics` endpoint based on IP address, network origin, or other criteria.
    - **Security Documentation**: Enhance documentation to explicitly warn users about the security risks of exposing the `/metrics` endpoint publicly without authentication and provide recommendations for securing it (e.g., using a reverse proxy with authentication, firewall rules).
- Preconditions:
    - The `github-traffic` application is deployed and running.
    - The network port 8001 (or the port where the `/metrics` endpoint is exposed if configured differently) is publicly accessible from the internet.
    - No external security measures (like firewalls or reverse proxies with authentication) are in place to protect the `/metrics` endpoint.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/github-traffic.py`
        - Line 152: `start_http_server(8001)`
        - This line initiates the Prometheus HTTP server, which exposes metrics at the default `/metrics` endpoint on port 8001.
        - The `start_http_server` function from the `prometheus_client` library, used here, does not inherently include any authentication or authorization mechanisms. It simply starts an HTTP server that serves the collected metrics.
        - There is no other code within `github-traffic.py` or the provided project files that implements any form of authentication or access control for this endpoint. The application relies solely on network configuration for security, which is insufficient when public exposure is possible.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `github-traffic` application using Docker, as described in the `README.md` and `docker-compose.yaml`. Ensure that port 8001 on the host machine is mapped to port 8001 in the container and is accessible from an external network.
    2. Obtain the public IP address or hostname of the machine where the `github-traffic` application is deployed. Let's assume it is `<TARGET_IP>`.
    3. Open a web browser or use a command-line tool like `curl` on a machine outside the deployment environment (representing an attacker's machine).
    4. Access the Prometheus metrics endpoint by navigating to `http://<TARGET_IP>:8001/metrics`.
    5. Observe the response. It should be a plain text output containing Prometheus metrics, starting with lines like `# HELP github_traffic_views Number of views` and including metrics such as `github_traffic_views{repository="<repository_name>"} <value>`.
    6. Confirm that the metrics data is successfully retrieved without any prompts for credentials or authentication. This demonstrates that the `/metrics` endpoint is publicly accessible and unauthenticated, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive repository traffic information.
