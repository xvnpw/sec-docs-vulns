- Vulnerability Name: Unsecured Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
- Description: The `github-traffic` application exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics` without any authentication or authorization. This endpoint provides detailed information about GitHub repository traffic, including views, unique views, clones, unique clones, top paths, top referrers, and stargazers count for repositories within a specified organization or user. An attacker can access this endpoint without any credentials as long as the `github-traffic` instance is reachable over the network. By accessing this endpoint, an attacker can gain unauthorized insights into the traffic patterns of the targeted organization's or user's repositories.
- Impact: Exposure of sensitive repository traffic data. This data can reveal insights into the popularity and usage of specific repositories, potentially including sensitive projects. Attackers could use this information to understand development activity, identify popular resources, or gain a competitive advantage by understanding a target organization's focus and interests based on repository usage patterns.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The application exposes the `/metrics` endpoint without any form of access control.
- Missing Mitigations: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for the `/metrics` endpoint. This could involve:
    - Basic authentication: Require username and password to access the endpoint.
    - API key authentication: Require a valid API key in the request header or query parameters.
    - Network-based access control: Restrict access to the endpoint based on IP address or network range.
    - Integration with an authentication and authorization service: Use existing organizational authentication infrastructure to control access.
- Preconditions:
    - A `github-traffic` instance is running and accessible over the network.
    - The attacker knows or can discover the IP address or hostname and port (default: 8001) of the running `github-traffic` instance.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In the file `/code/github-traffic.py`, the application initializes and starts an HTTP server to expose Prometheus metrics using the line `start_http_server(8001)`.
    2. The `start_http_server` function from the `prometheus_client` library, by default, exposes the metrics endpoint on the specified port (8001 in this case) without any built-in authentication or authorization.
    3. The application logic within the `job_function` periodically fetches repository traffic data from GitHub using the PyGitHub library and updates Prometheus metrics gauges (e.g., `gh_traffic_views`, `gh_traffic_clones`, `gh_traffic_top_paths`).
    4. These metrics are then served by the HTTP server at the `/metrics` endpoint.
    5. There is no code in `github-traffic.py` or any other provided configuration files that implements any form of authentication or access control for the `/metrics` endpoint. Anyone who can reach the application on port 8001 can access the `/metrics` endpoint and retrieve the exposed data.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `github-traffic` application using Docker Compose as described in the `README.md` and `docker-compose.yaml` files. Ensure that the `.env` file is configured with a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` and either `ORG_NAME` or `USER_NAME`.
    2. Once the application is running, identify the IP address or hostname of the machine where `github-traffic` is deployed. If running locally, this would typically be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
    3. Open a web browser or use a command-line tool like `curl` or `wget`.
    4. Access the metrics endpoint by navigating to `http://<github-traffic-instance-ip>:8001/metrics`.
    5. Observe the output. You should see a plaintext output containing Prometheus metrics, including `github_traffic_views`, `github_traffic_clones`, `github_traffic_top_paths`, `github_traffic_top_referrers`, and other metrics related to repository traffic.
    6. Verify that there is no prompt for username, password, API key, or any other form of authentication.
    7. This confirms that the `/metrics` endpoint is publicly accessible without any authentication, and an attacker can retrieve sensitive repository traffic data by simply accessing this URL.
