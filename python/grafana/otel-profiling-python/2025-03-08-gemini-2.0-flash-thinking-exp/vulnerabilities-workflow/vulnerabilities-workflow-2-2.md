### Vulnerability List:

*   Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via OpenTelemetry Span Attributes in Pyroscope Profiling
*   Description:
    1. Developers use OpenTelemetry to instrument their Python application for distributed tracing.
    2. Developers use Pyroscope to instrument their Python application for continuous profiling.
    3. Developers integrate the `pyroscope-otel` library to link OpenTelemetry traces and Pyroscope profiles.
    4. Developers, unknowingly or unintentionally, include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data) as attributes in OpenTelemetry spans. This is a common practice for adding contextual information to traces.
    5. The `pyroscope-otel` library's `PyroscopeSpanProcessor` automatically adds a `pyroscope.profile.id` attribute to root spans and a `span_id` tag to Pyroscope profiles, linking the trace and profile data using the span ID.
    6. If the Pyroscope setup, or any system that consumes Pyroscope data, is configured to capture or expose tags associated with profiling data, the sensitive information from the OpenTelemetry span attributes, linked by the `span_id` tag, can be inadvertently exposed.
    7. Attackers who have access to the profiling data (e.g., through a Pyroscope UI or API, or logs that include profiling data with tags) can then potentially access this sensitive information.

*   Impact:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information that was inadvertently included in OpenTelemetry span attributes. This could include credentials, API keys, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or other confidential data, depending on what developers mistakenly add as span attributes.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data if exposed credentials or API keys are compromised.
    *   Reputational damage and legal liabilities due to data breaches.

*   Vulnerability Rank: Medium
    *   The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by external attackers against the `pyroscope-otel` library itself.
    *   The risk depends on developer practices (adding sensitive data to span attributes) and the configuration of the Pyroscope infrastructure (how tags are handled and exposed).
    *   However, the impact of information disclosure can be significant.

*   Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None. The current code in `pyroscope-otel` does not implement any mitigations against this vulnerability. It focuses solely on linking traces and profiles by adding the `span_id` tag.

*   Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Documentation Warning:** The most crucial missing mitigation is clear documentation that explicitly warns developers about the risk of including sensitive information in OpenTelemetry span attributes when using `pyroscope-otel`. The documentation should advise developers to avoid adding sensitive data as span attributes or to implement sanitization/filtering mechanisms before attributes are potentially linked to profiling data.
    *   **Configuration Options (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary for a library of this type, consideration could be given to adding configuration options to:
        *   Disable the automatic tagging of Pyroscope profiles with `span_id`. This would break the linking functionality but could be used in highly sensitive environments where any potential information leakage is unacceptable.
        *   Allowlist/Denylist for span attributes to be propagated or linked to Pyroscope. This would be more complex to implement and configure but could offer a more fine-grained control.

*   Preconditions:
    *   The Python application must be using both OpenTelemetry and Pyroscope.
    *   The `pyroscope-otel` library must be integrated into the application's OpenTelemetry setup.
    *   Developers must be adding sensitive information as attributes to OpenTelemetry spans.
    *   The Pyroscope or related monitoring infrastructure must be configured in a way that tags associated with profiles are accessible to potentially unauthorized parties. This could be through a UI, API, or logs.

*   Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `PyroscopeSpanProcessor` class is defined in `src/pyroscope/otel/__init__.py`.
    2. In the `on_start` method, the code checks if the span is a root span using `_is_root_span(span)`. Root spans are typically the entry points of a trace and are more likely to contain higher-level contextual information.
    3. If it's a root span, `span.set_attribute(PROFILE_ID_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_KEY, format(span.context.span_id, "016x"))` adds an attribute named `pyroscope.profile.id` to the OpenTelemetry span itself. This attribute is primarily for internal use within the tracing system and is not directly related to the information disclosure vulnerability in the context of Pyroscope profiling.
    4. Critically, `pyroscope.add_thread_tag(threading.get_ident(), PROFILE_ID_PYROSCOPE_TAG_KEY, _get_span_id(span))` is called. This line adds a thread tag to the Pyroscope profiling data for the current thread.
        *   `threading.get_ident()` gets the unique identifier for the current thread.
        *   `PROFILE_ID_PYROSCOPE_TAG_KEY` is defined as `'span_id'`. This is the key for the tag in Pyroscope.
        *   `_get_span_id(span)` formats the span's ID into a hexadecimal string.
    5.  The `on_end` method, for root spans, calls `pyroscope.remove_thread_tag` to remove the tag when the span ends, ensuring tags are thread-specific and do not leak across unrelated operations within the same thread.

    **Explanation of Vulnerability Path:**

    The `PyroscopeSpanProcessor`'s core function is to establish a link between OpenTelemetry spans and Pyroscope profiles using the `span_id`.  It achieves this by adding a `span_id` tag to the Pyroscope profile.  This tag itself is not sensitive.

    However, if developers mistakenly add *sensitive data as span attributes* (e.g., `span.set_attribute("user_id", "sensitive_user_id")`), this sensitive data is now part of the OpenTelemetry span's context.

    While `pyroscope-otel` does not directly send these *attributes* to Pyroscope, the *link* it creates via the `span_id` tag can be exploited for information disclosure if:

    1.  Pyroscope or a system consuming Pyroscope data is configured to capture or expose these tags.
    2.  There is a mechanism (either within Pyroscope itself or in a related monitoring/analysis tool) that allows correlating Pyroscope profiles (identified by `span_id` tag) back to the original OpenTelemetry spans and their attributes.

    In a typical setup, Pyroscope primarily focuses on performance profiling data (CPU, memory, etc.). However, Pyroscope does support tags, and systems built around or integrated with Pyroscope might be designed to utilize these tags for various purposes, including potentially linking back to tracing systems and accessing span attributes for enriched analysis or debugging.  If such a system is in place and is not properly secured, or if developers are unaware of this potential data linkage, sensitive information from span attributes could be exposed through the profiling data indirectly via the `span_id` tag.

*   Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        *   Set up a basic Python application instrumented with OpenTelemetry and Pyroscope profiler as per the library's documentation and Pyroscope documentation. You will need a Pyroscope server running to send profiling data to. For testing purposes, you can use a local Pyroscope instance.
        *   Integrate the `pyroscope-otel` library into the application.
    2. **Modify Application Code:**
        *   In your application code, create a root OpenTelemetry span.
        *   Within this span, add a span attribute that contains sensitive information. For example:
            ```python
            from opentelemetry import trace
            from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
            from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter
            from pyroscope_otel import PyroscopeSpanProcessor
            import pyroscope

            pyroscope.configure(
                application_name = "test-app",
                server_address   = "http://localhost:4040", # Replace with your Pyroscope server address
            )

            provider = TracerProvider()
            provider.add_span_processor(PyroscopeSpanProcessor())
            # For demonstration, also export spans to console to see attributes
            provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))
            trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

            tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

            with tracer.start_as_current_span("test-span") as span:
                span.set_attribute("sensitive_data", "洩漏的秘密") # Sensitive data in attribute
                print("Doing some work...")
            print("Span ended")
            ```
    3. **Run the Application:** Execute your modified Python application. This will generate OpenTelemetry spans and Pyroscope profiling data, linked by the `span_id` tag.
    4. **Observe Pyroscope Data (Simulated):**
        *   **In a real-world scenario**, you would need to examine the Pyroscope server's data or any system consuming Pyroscope data to see if the `span_id` tag is present and accessible.  You would then need to investigate if there's a way to correlate this `span_id` back to the OpenTelemetry span and its attributes within your monitoring infrastructure.
        *   **For this test case**, as direct access to a system correlating Pyroscope tags to OpenTelemetry attributes might not be readily available, we will focus on demonstrating the *presence* of the `span_id` tag in Pyroscope data. You would typically observe this in the Pyroscope UI (if it displays tags) or in the raw data sent to the Pyroscope server (e.g., if you are logging or capturing network traffic).
        *   **Simulate observation:** Imagine you are inspecting the data received by the Pyroscope server. You would look for profiling samples related to your "test-app" and check if they contain a tag like `span_id` with a hexadecimal value.
    5. **Analyze Results:**
        *   Confirm that the `span_id` tag is indeed present in the Pyroscope profiling data. This validates that `pyroscope-otel` is correctly adding the tag to link traces and profiles.
        *   The console output from `ConsoleSpanExporter` will show the span with the `sensitive_data` attribute, confirming that sensitive data is being added as a span attribute.
        *   **Demonstrate the potential risk:** Explain that if an attacker gains access to the Pyroscope data (or a system consuming it) and if that system allows correlating the `span_id` tag back to OpenTelemetry spans, the sensitive data in the `sensitive_data` attribute *could* be disclosed.  This step is about illustrating the *potential* vulnerability enabled by the linkage, even if we cannot directly demonstrate full exploitability within this test setup without a more complex monitoring infrastructure.

This test case demonstrates how `pyroscope-otel` creates the link between traces and profiles using the `span_id` tag, and highlights the *potential* information disclosure vulnerability if developers inadvertently include sensitive data in span attributes and if the Pyroscope infrastructure exposes these linked tags in a way that can be correlated with OpenTelemetry data. The test emphasizes the need for documentation warnings and developer awareness regarding sensitive data in span attributes when using this library.
