## Vulnerability List:

### 1. Information Disclosure via Profile Data in Traces

- **Description:**
    1. The `PyroscopeSpanProcessor` adds a span attribute named `pyroscope.profile.id` to the root spans of OpenTelemetry traces. The value of this attribute is set to the span's ID.
    2. Simultaneously, for root spans, the processor adds a tag named `span_id` with the same span ID value to the Pyroscope profiles generated for the corresponding thread.
    3. This mechanism links OpenTelemetry traces to Pyroscope profiles using the span ID as a common identifier.
    4. If OpenTelemetry traces are exported to external systems (e.g., monitoring dashboards, observability platforms, or third-party collectors), the `pyroscope.profile.id` attribute, containing the span ID, is also exported.
    5. An attacker gaining access to these exported OpenTelemetry traces can observe the `pyroscope.profile.id` attribute.
    6. If Pyroscope profiles contain sensitive information about the application's internal workings, business logic, or data processing (which is the purpose of profiling), and if an attacker can correlate the `pyroscope.profile.id` from the traces with access to Pyroscope data (directly or indirectly), they could potentially access and analyze these sensitive profiles.
    7. This linkage, while intended for observability, can inadvertently expose sensitive profiling data to anyone who can access the exported OpenTelemetry traces.

- **Impact:**
    Exposure of sensitive information contained within Pyroscope profiles to unauthorized parties who have access to OpenTelemetry traces. This could include:
    - Application internals (e.g., function names, execution flow).
    - Business logic (e.g., algorithms, decision-making processes).
    - Sensitive data being processed (e.g., user IDs, financial data if captured in profiles).
    The severity depends on the sensitivity of the data captured by Pyroscope profiles and the accessibility of the exported OpenTelemetry traces to unauthorized individuals.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly implements the linkage between traces and profiles without any explicit safeguards against information disclosure.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Warning:**  The documentation should explicitly warn users about the potential risks of information disclosure. It should highlight that by linking traces and profiles, sensitive information present in profiles might become indirectly accessible to anyone who can access the exported OpenTelemetry traces.
    - **Guidance on Data Sanitization:**  Provide guidance on how to sanitize or filter sensitive data from Pyroscope profiles when using this integration. Suggest strategies to configure Pyroscope to capture only non-sensitive data or to mask/redact sensitive information before profiles are generated, especially when used in conjunction with OpenTelemetry integration.
    - **Consider Alternative Linkage Mechanisms:** Evaluate if linking profile IDs in traces is the most secure approach. Explore alternative methods for correlating traces and profiles that minimize the risk of information leakage, or provide options to disable the linkage for users with heightened security concerns.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A Python application instrumented with both OpenTelemetry and Pyroscope.
    - The `pyroscope-otel` library is installed and `PyroscopeSpanProcessor` is registered with the OpenTelemetry tracer provider.
    - Pyroscope is configured to capture profiles that contain potentially sensitive information.
    - OpenTelemetry traces are exported to a system or location accessible to potential attackers (e.g., a publicly accessible monitoring dashboard, a third-party observability platform, or even logs that might be inadvertently exposed).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/src/pyroscope/otel/__init__.py`
    - **Class:** `PyroscopeSpanProcessor`
    - **Method:** `on_start(self, span: Span, parent_context: typing.Optional[Context] = None) -> None:`
        ```python
        def on_start(
            self, span: Span, parent_context: typing.Optional[Context] = None
        ) -> None:
            if _is_root_span(span):
                span.set_attribute(PROFILE_ID_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_KEY, format(span.context.span_id, "016x"))
                pyroscope.add_thread_tag(threading.get_ident(), PROFILE_ID_PYROSCOPE_TAG_KEY, _get_span_id(span))
        ```
        - This code snippet is executed when a new span starts.
        - `_is_root_span(span)` checks if the span is a root span (has no parent or a remote parent).
        - If it's a root span, `span.set_attribute(PROFILE_ID_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_KEY, format(span.context.span_id, "016x"))` adds the attribute `pyroscope.profile.id` to the span with the span ID as its value. This is the crucial step that embeds the link into the trace data.
        - `pyroscope.add_thread_tag(threading.get_ident(), PROFILE_ID_PYROSCOPE_TAG_KEY, _get_span_id(span))` adds a tag to the Pyroscope profile for the current thread, also using the span ID. This establishes the link on the Pyroscope side.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a Python application that uses both OpenTelemetry and Pyroscope, and includes the `pyroscope-otel` library. Configure Pyroscope to capture CPU profiles. Instrument a part of the application to generate OpenTelemetry traces, ensuring root spans are created. Configure OpenTelemetry to export traces to a simple console exporter for demonstration purposes, or to a more realistic exporter like Jaeger or Zipkin for a more complete test.
    2. **Execution:** Run the application and trigger the instrumented code paths to generate OpenTelemetry traces and Pyroscope profiles. Ensure that root spans are created during this execution.
    3. **Trace Inspection:** Examine the exported OpenTelemetry traces (e.g., in the console output or Jaeger UI). Look for root spans. Verify that these root spans contain the attribute `pyroscope.profile.id`. Note down the value of this attribute (which is the span ID).
    4. **Profile Correlation (Manual):**  While direct access to Pyroscope profiles might depend on the Pyroscope setup, observe the Pyroscope output or logs (if available) for the profiled application. Confirm that profiles generated around the same time as the traces contain tags, including `span_id`, which matches the `pyroscope.profile.id` observed in the OpenTelemetry traces. Alternatively, if Pyroscope UI or API access is available in a test environment, attempt to retrieve profiles using timestamps corresponding to the trace and check for the `span_id` tag.
    5. **Information Disclosure Demonstration:**  Explain how an attacker who has access to the exported OpenTelemetry traces (and thus can see the `pyroscope.profile.id`) could potentially gain insights into the application's behavior by correlating this ID with Pyroscope profile data, assuming they have some means to access or infer information from Pyroscope profiles.  This step is more about demonstrating the *potential* for information disclosure rather than a direct exploit within this test case's scope, as direct Pyroscope data access is environment-dependent. The core vulnerability is the embedding of the link (span ID) into the exported traces, which is clearly demonstrated by the presence of the `pyroscope.profile.id` attribute.
