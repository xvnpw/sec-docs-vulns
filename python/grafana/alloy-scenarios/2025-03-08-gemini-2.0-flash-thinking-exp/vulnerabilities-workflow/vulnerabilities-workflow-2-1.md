### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Alloy UI Exposure (Windows Scenario)
- Description:
    - The `windows` scenario README provides instructions to configure Grafana Alloy on a Windows machine.
    - Step 3 of the README, under "Personal recommendation", advises users to modify the Grafana Alloy service arguments in the Windows Registry.
    - The recommended change includes setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`.
    - This configuration makes the Grafana Alloy UI accessible on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 12345.
    - The provided example configurations for Alloy do not include any authentication mechanisms for the UI.
    - As a result, if a user follows these instructions, the Grafana Alloy UI will be publicly accessible without authentication to anyone who can reach the Windows machine's IP address and port 12345.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access: Attackers on the same network or with network access to the Windows machine can access the Grafana Alloy UI without any credentials.
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can view the Grafana Alloy configuration, which may contain sensitive information about the monitored systems, internal network structure, and potentially credentials if embedded in the Alloy configuration (though not shown in these examples, it's a general risk).
    - Potential for Further Exploitation: If the Alloy UI or API has further vulnerabilities, or if the Alloy instance has excessive permissions, attackers could potentially leverage the UI access to further compromise the monitored systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided configuration explicitly encourages exposing the UI without authentication.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Authentication Enforcement: The example configuration should include and strongly recommend enabling authentication for the Grafana Alloy UI. Grafana Alloy supports various authentication methods that should be configured.
    - Security Warning in README: The `windows/README.md` should include a prominent warning about the security risks of exposing the Alloy UI without authentication, especially when setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0`. It should advise users to configure authentication and consider restricting access in production environments.
    - Principle of Least Privilege Guidance: While not directly related to UI exposure, the documentation should generally encourage users to apply the principle of least privilege when configuring Alloy, limiting the permissions and network exposure of Alloy instances to the minimum required for their monitoring tasks.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must follow the instructions in the `windows/README.md` and apply the "Personal recommendation" to modify the Grafana Alloy service arguments, specifically setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`.
    - The Windows machine running Grafana Alloy must be network accessible on port 12345.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/windows/README.md`
    - Step 3 "Install Grafana Alloy", under "Personal recommendation", provides instructions to modify the Alloy service arguments:
    ```
    Personal recommendation: If you would like to see the Alloy UI from a remote machine you need to change the run arguments of the Grafana Alloy service. To do this:
    ...
    4. Change the contents to the following:
    ```
    ```
    run
    C:\Program Files\GrafanaLabs\Alloy\config.alloy
    --storage.path=C:\ProgramData\GrafanaLabs\Alloy\data
    --server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345
    ```
    - The line `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345` in the recommended arguments explicitly binds the Alloy HTTP server to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 12345.
    - None of the provided `config.alloy` files in the `windows` scenario or referenced documentation configure any form of authentication for the Alloy UI.
    - This combination of instructions and default configuration directly leads to an unauthenticated Alloy UI being exposed if the user follows the guide.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Follow the steps in `/code/windows/README.md` to set up the Windows monitoring scenario on a Windows machine. This includes:
            - Cloning the repository to the Windows machine.
            - Deploying Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus using `docker-compose up -d` in the `windows` directory.
            - Installing Grafana Alloy on the Windows machine as a service, following the linked documentation.
            - **Crucially**, apply the "Personal recommendation" from Step 3 in `/code/windows/README.md` by modifying the Grafana Alloy service arguments in the Windows Registry to include `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`. Restart the Grafana Alloy service after this change.
            - Do not make any other changes to the default configurations.
    2. **Determine Target IP:** Find the IP address of the Windows machine on the network. Let's assume it is `192.168.1.100`.
    3. **Access Alloy UI from Attacker Machine:** From a separate machine on the same network (the "attacker" machine), open a web browser.
    4. **Navigate to Alloy UI:** In the browser's address bar, enter `http://192.168.1.100:12345` (replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual IP address of the Windows machine).
    5. **Verify Unauthenticated Access:** Observe that the Grafana Alloy UI loads in the browser without prompting for any username or password. The attacker can now access and explore the Alloy UI and its configuration without authentication, confirming the vulnerability.
