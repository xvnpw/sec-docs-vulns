### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Alloy UI Exposure (Windows Scenario)
- Description:
    - The `windows` scenario README provides instructions to configure Grafana Alloy on a Windows machine.
    - Step 3 of the README, under "Personal recommendation", advises users to modify the Grafana Alloy service arguments in the Windows Registry.
    - The recommended change includes setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`.
    - This configuration makes the Grafana Alloy UI accessible on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 12345.
    - The provided example configurations for Alloy do not include any authentication mechanisms for the UI.
    - As a result, if a user follows these instructions, the Grafana Alloy UI will be publicly accessible without authentication to anyone who can reach the Windows machine's IP address and port 12345.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access: Attackers on the same network or with network access to the Windows machine can access the Grafana Alloy UI without any credentials.
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can view the Grafana Alloy configuration, which may contain sensitive information about the monitored systems, internal network structure, and potentially credentials if embedded in the Alloy configuration (though not shown in these examples, it's a general risk).
    - Potential for Further Exploitation: If the Alloy UI or API has further vulnerabilities, or if the Alloy instance has excessive permissions, attackers could potentially leverage the UI access to further compromise the monitored systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided configuration explicitly encourages exposing the UI without authentication.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Authentication Enforcement: The example configuration should include and strongly recommend enabling authentication for the Grafana Alloy UI. Grafana Alloy supports various authentication methods that should be configured.
    - Security Warning in README: The `windows/README.md` should include a prominent warning about the security risks of exposing the Alloy UI without authentication, especially when setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0`. It should advise users to configure authentication and consider restricting access in production environments.
    - Principle of Least Privilege Guidance: While not directly related to UI exposure, the documentation should generally encourage users to apply the principle of least privilege when configuring Alloy, limiting the permissions and network exposure of Alloy instances to the minimum required for their monitoring tasks.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must follow the instructions in the `windows/README.md` and apply the "Personal recommendation" to modify the Grafana Alloy service arguments, specifically setting `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`.
    - The Windows machine running Grafana Alloy must be network accessible on port 12345.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/windows/README.md`
    - Step 3 "Install Grafana Alloy", under "Personal recommendation", provides instructions to modify the Alloy service arguments:
    ```
    Personal recommendation: If you would like to see the Alloy UI from a remote machine you need to change the run arguments of the Grafana Alloy service. To do this:
    ...
    4. Change the contents to the following:
    ```
    ```
    run
    C:\Program Files\GrafanaLabs\Alloy\config.alloy
    --storage.path=C:\ProgramData\GrafanaLabs\Alloy\data
    --server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345
    ```
    - The line `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345` in the recommended arguments explicitly binds the Alloy HTTP server to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 12345.
    - None of the provided `config.alloy` files in the `windows` scenario or referenced documentation configure any form of authentication for the Alloy UI.
    - This combination of instructions and default configuration directly leads to an unauthenticated Alloy UI being exposed if the user follows the guide.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Follow the steps in `/code/windows/README.md` to set up the Windows monitoring scenario on a Windows machine. This includes:
            - Cloning the repository to the Windows machine.
            - Deploying Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus using `docker-compose up -d` in the `windows` directory.
            - Installing Grafana Alloy on the Windows machine as a service, following the linked documentation.
            - **Crucially**, apply the "Personal recommendation" from Step 3 in `/code/windows/README.md` by modifying the Grafana Alloy service arguments in the Windows Registry to include `--server.http.listen-addr=0.0.0.0:12345`. Restart the Grafana Alloy service after this change.
            - Do not make any other changes to the default configurations.
    2. **Determine Target IP:** Find the IP address of the Windows machine on the network. Let's assume it is `192.168.1.100`.
    3. **Access Alloy UI from Attacker Machine:** From a separate machine on the same network (the "attacker" machine), open a web browser.
    4. **Navigate to Alloy UI:** In the browser's address bar, enter `http://192.168.1.100:12345` (replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual IP address of the Windows machine).
    5. **Verify Unauthenticated Access:** Observe that the Grafana Alloy UI loads in the browser without prompting for any username or password. The attacker can now access and explore the Alloy UI and its configuration without authentication, confirming the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated TCP Log Ingestion Endpoint
- Description:
    - The example configurations in the `logs-tcp` scenario expose an unauthenticated TCP endpoint for receiving logs.
    - Specifically, the `config.alloy` file configures a `log_receiver.tcp` component listening on `0.0.0.0:9999`.
    - This endpoint is intended to receive logs in JSON format, as demonstrated by the `simulator.py` script.
    - An attacker can connect to this open TCP port and send arbitrary log messages in the expected JSON format.
    - These injected logs will be processed by Grafana Alloy and forwarded to Loki, polluting the log data.
- Impact:
    - Log Injection: Attackers can inject arbitrary log entries into the system's logs stored in Loki.
    - False Monitoring Data: Injected logs can lead to misleading dashboards and alerts in Grafana, undermining the integrity of the monitoring system.
    - Operational Disruption: Malicious logs can make it difficult to identify genuine issues, potentially delaying incident response and resolution.
    - Resource Exhaustion (Potential): While not a denial of service in itself, a large volume of injected logs could consume storage and processing resources in Loki.
    - Data Tampering: Injected logs can be used to cover up malicious activities or frame legitimate users.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The example configurations are explicitly designed for demonstration purposes and do not include any authentication or access control mechanisms for the TCP log ingestion endpoint.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication to verify the identity of log senders and authorization to control who can send logs. This could involve mutual TLS, API keys, or other authentication methods supported by Grafana Alloy or a reverse proxy in front of it.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize incoming log data to prevent injection of malicious content or unexpected formats that could cause issues in downstream processing or storage.
    - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on the log ingestion endpoint to prevent attackers from flooding the system with logs and potentially causing performance degradation.
    - Network Segmentation: Restrict network access to the log ingestion endpoint to only trusted sources.
- Preconditions:
    - The `logs-tcp` scenario is deployed using the provided `docker-compose.yml` and `config.alloy` without modifications.
    - The TCP port `9999` on the machine running Grafana Alloy is publicly accessible or accessible to the attacker's network.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/logs-tcp/config.alloy`
        ```alloy
        local.log_receiver.tcp "receiver" {
          listen_address = "0.0.0.0:9999"
          encoding       = "json"
          format         = "json"
        }
        ```
        - This code block defines a `log_receiver.tcp` component named "receiver".
        - `listen_address = "0.0.0.0:9999"`: This line configures the receiver to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 9999. This makes the endpoint publicly accessible if the host machine is exposed to the internet or an attacker's network.
        - There are no authentication or authorization parameters configured for this `log_receiver.tcp` component.
    - File: `/code/logs-tcp/docker-compose.yml`
        ```yaml
        ports:
          - 12345:12345
          - 4318:4318
        ```
        - This docker-compose file explicitly publishes ports 12345 and 4318. While port 9999 is not explicitly published here, the `config.alloy` binds the TCP receiver to `0.0.0.0:9999`, which makes it accessible from within the docker network and potentially externally depending on network configurations.
    - File: `/code/logs-tcp/simulator.py`
        - This script demonstrates sending JSON formatted logs to the TCP endpoint at `TARGET_HOST:TARGET_PORT`, which defaults to `alloy:9999` in the docker-compose setup. This confirms the intended usage and lack of security.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy the `logs-tcp` scenario: Navigate to the `/code/logs-tcp` directory in the cloned repository and run `docker-compose up -d`.
    2. Identify the IP address of the host machine where Docker is running. Let's assume it's `<HOST_IP>`.
    3. Open a terminal and use `netcat` (or a similar TCP client) to connect to the exposed TCP port `9999` on the host machine: `nc <HOST_IP> 9999`.
    4. Once connected, send a crafted JSON log message. For example:
        ```json
        {"timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z", "severity": "CRITICAL", "body": "Malicious log injected by attacker", "service_name": "AttackerService"}
        ```
        Type or paste the JSON message into the `netcat` terminal and press Enter.
    5. Access Grafana: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the default credentials if prompted (anonymous access is enabled in the provided configurations).
    6. Explore Logs in Grafana: Navigate to the "Explore" section (Loki explorer).
    7. Query for the injected log: In the Loki query field, enter `{service_name="AttackerService"}` and run the query.
    8. Verify Log Injection: Confirm that the log message "Malicious log injected by attacker" is present in the logs, associated with the `AttackerService`. This demonstrates successful log injection via the unauthenticated TCP endpoint.
