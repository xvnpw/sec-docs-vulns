### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Credentials
- Description:
    - A developer using the `grafana-openai-monitoring` library might directly embed sensitive credentials such as OpenAI API keys and Grafana Cloud access tokens within the application's source code.
    - This occurs because the library's documentation and example code snippets instruct users to replace placeholder strings like `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` with their actual, sensitive values directly in the code.
    - If a developer follows these instructions without implementing secure credential management practices, the credentials will be hardcoded into the application.
- Impact:
    - **Unauthorized OpenAI API Access:** If an attacker gains access to the application's source code (e.g., through a publicly accessible repository, exposed files, or via compromised developer machines), they can extract the hardcoded OpenAI API key. This allows the attacker to make unauthorized calls to the OpenAI API, potentially incurring costs for the legitimate user and gaining access to OpenAI's language models for malicious purposes.
    - **Unauthorized Grafana Cloud Access:** Similarly, if the Grafana Cloud access token is hardcoded and compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the victim's Grafana Cloud instance. This could lead to:
        - **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive metrics and logs data stored in Grafana Cloud, potentially revealing business-critical information or user data.
        - **Monitoring System Manipulation:** Tampering with dashboards, alerts, and monitoring configurations within Grafana Cloud, disrupting monitoring capabilities or hiding malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not include any code-level mitigations to prevent or warn against hardcoding credentials. The library functions as designed, accepting credentials as parameters without enforcing secure input methods.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Documentation Enhancement:** The documentation should be updated to prominently and explicitly warn against hardcoding credentials. It should strongly recommend secure alternatives like using environment variables, configuration files, or dedicated secret management solutions.
    - **Example Code Update:** The example code snippets in the documentation (README files in Python and Node.js modules, and the main README.md) should be revised to demonstrate loading credentials from environment variables instead of directly embedding them as strings.
    - **Code Warning (Optional):**  Consider adding a runtime warning within the library. For instance, the `monitor` functions could check if the provided credential parameters appear to be string literals (heuristically, or by checking the type and value origin). If suspected hardcoding is detected, a warning message could be logged, advising the developer against this practice in production environments.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer uses the `grafana-openai-monitoring` library in their application.
    - The developer follows the documentation and examples provided in the project's README files.
    - The developer directly replaces the placeholder credential strings in the example code with their actual OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access token, thus hardcoding them.
    - The application's source code or the compiled/packaged application becomes accessible to an attacker. This could happen through various means, including:
        - Publicly accessible version control repositories (e.g., accidentally committing code with hardcoded secrets to a public GitHub repository).
        - Exposed application files on web servers or cloud storage.
        - Insider threats or compromised developer accounts.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/chat_v1.py` and `code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/chat_v2.py`:**
        - The `monitor` functions in both `chat_v1.py` and `chat_v2.py` are designed to accept sensitive parameters directly: `metrics_url`, `logs_url`, `metrics_username`, `logs_username`, and `access_token`.
        - These parameters are passed directly to the `__send_metrics` and `__send_logs` functions in `__handlers.py` to authenticate with Grafana Cloud services.
        - There is no input validation or security check within these functions to prevent or discourage the use of hardcoded strings for these sensitive parameters.

        ```python
        # Example from chat_v2.py (similar in chat_v1.py)
        def monitor(func, metrics_url, logs_url, metrics_username, logs_username, access_token, use_async=False, disable_content=False, environment="default"):
            # ...
            metrics_url, logs_url = __check(metrics_url,
                                            logs_url,
                                            metrics_username,
                                            logs_username,
                                            access_token
                                    )
            # ...
            # Credentials are used to send metrics and logs
            __send_metrics(metrics_url=metrics_url,
                           metrics_username=metrics_username,
                           access_token=access_token,
                           metrics=metrics)
            __send_logs(logs_url=logs_url,
                        logs_username=logs_username,
                        access_token=access_token,
                        logs=logs
            )
            # ...
        ```
    - **`code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/__handlers.py`:**
        - The `__check` function only validates if the required parameters are *provided* and performs URL format checks. It does *not* check the *source* or *security* of these parameters. It does not prevent hardcoded strings from being used.

        ```python
        def __check(metrics_url, logs_url, metrics_username, logs_username, access_token):
            # Check if all required parameters are provided
            if not all([metrics_url, logs_url, metrics_username, logs_username, access_token]):
                raise ValueError("All parameters ... must be provided")
            # ... URL format checks ...
            return (
                metrics_url[:-1] if metrics_url.endswith('/') else metrics_url,
                logs_url[:-1] if logs_url.endswith('/') else logs_url
            )
        ```
    - **`code/README.md`, `code/python/README.md`, `code/node/README.md`:**
        - The README files provide example code that encourages hardcoding by using placeholder strings for credentials and instructing users to replace them directly.

        ```python
        # Example from /code/python/README.md
        client = OpenAI(
            api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", # <--- Placeholder for API Key
        )

        client.chat.completions.create = chat_v2.monitor(
            client.chat.completions.create,
            metrics_url="YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL",  # <--- Placeholder for Metrics URL
            logs_url="YOUR_LOKI_LOGS_URL",  # <--- Placeholder for Logs URL
            metrics_username="YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME",  # <--- Placeholder for Metrics Username
            logs_username="YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME",  # <--- Placeholder for Logs Username
            access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # <--- Placeholder for Access Token
        )
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a Python file named `test_hardcoded_creds.py` with the following content, mimicking the example in the documentation but with placeholder credentials:

        ```python
        import os
        from openai import OpenAI
        from grafana_openai_monitoring import chat_v2

        openai_api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded API Key Placeholder
        metrics_url = "YOUR_PROMETHEUS_URL_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded Metrics URL Placeholder
        logs_url = "YOUR_LOKI_URL_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded Logs URL Placeholder
        metrics_username = "YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded Metrics Username Placeholder
        logs_username = "YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded Logs Username Placeholder
        access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER" # Hardcoded Access Token Placeholder


        client = OpenAI(
            api_key=openai_api_key,
        )

        client.chat.completions.create = chat_v2.monitor(
            client.chat.completions.create,
            metrics_url=metrics_url,
            logs_url=logs_url,
            metrics_username=metrics_username,
            logs_username=logs_username,
            access_token=access_token
        )

        response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}])
        print(response)
        ```

    2. **Execution:** Run the Python script: `python test_hardcoded_creds.py`

    3. **Source Code Inspection:** Open the `test_hardcoded_creds.py` file in a text editor or IDE.

    4. **Verification:** Manually examine the source code of `test_hardcoded_creds.py`. Observe that the sensitive credential placeholders (`"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER"`, `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER"`, etc.) are clearly visible as string literals directly within the code.

    5. **Conclusion:** This test case demonstrates that by following the project's documentation examples and directly assigning credential values as strings, developers inadvertently hardcode sensitive information into their source code. If this code were to be exposed (e.g., committed to a public repository), the placeholders (and actual credentials if used instead of placeholders) would be readily accessible to anyone with access to the source code. This confirms the vulnerability of hardcoded credentials due to the project's documentation and examples.
