### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name
Insecure Credential Handling via Hardcoding

#### Description
1. A user sets up the `grafana-openai-monitoring` library in their Python or JavaScript application by following the usage examples provided in the README files (e.g., `/code/README.md`, `/code/python/README.md`, `/code/node/README.md`).
2. In the example code, the user replaces the placeholder values such as `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL"`, `"YOUR_LOKI_LOGS_URL"`, `"YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME"`, `"YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME"`, and `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` with their actual OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access tokens directly in the code.
3. The user commits and pushes this code to a version control system like Git, or deploys the application.
4. If the repository is public or becomes accessible to an attacker (e.g., through compromised access controls, insider threat, or accidental exposure), the attacker can read the source code and extract the hardcoded OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access tokens.

#### Impact
- **Unauthorized Access to OpenAI API:** An attacker who obtains the hardcoded OpenAI API key can make requests to the OpenAI API on behalf of the victim's application. This could lead to:
    - **Financial Loss:**  The attacker could consume the victim's OpenAI API credits, leading to unexpected charges.
    - **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access or manipulate data through the OpenAI API, depending on the scope of the API key's permissions.
    - **Reputational Damage:** If the attacker uses the compromised API key for malicious purposes, it could reflect negatively on the victim's organization.
- **Unauthorized Access to Grafana Cloud:** An attacker who obtains the hardcoded Grafana Cloud access token can gain access to the victim's Grafana Cloud account. This could lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** The attacker could access sensitive metrics and logs data stored in Grafana Cloud, potentially revealing confidential information about the victim's application and its users.
    - **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete metrics and logs data, disrupting monitoring and analysis capabilities, or covering their tracks.
    - **Account Takeover:** In some cases, the access token might grant broader permissions, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the entire Grafana Cloud account.

#### Vulnerability Rank
High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
None. The provided examples in the README files directly encourage hardcoding credentials.

#### Missing Mitigations
- **Warning against Hardcoding Credentials in Documentation:** The README files and documentation should explicitly warn users against hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in the code.
- **Recommendation for Secure Credential Handling:** The documentation should guide users on secure methods for handling credentials, such as:
    - **Environment Variables:**  Suggest loading credentials from environment variables, as demonstrated in the test files (`/code/python/tests/test_chat_v1.py`, `/code/python/tests/test_chat_v2.py`).
    - **Configuration Files:** Recommend using configuration files that are not stored in the version control system and are securely managed.
    - **Secrets Management Systems:** For more complex deployments, suggest using dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- **Code Examples using Environment Variables:**  The usage examples in the README files should be updated to demonstrate loading credentials from environment variables instead of hardcoding them.

#### Preconditions
- The user follows the insecure examples in the README files and hardcodes their OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access tokens directly into their application code.
- The source code with hardcoded credentials becomes accessible to an attacker, either publicly or through unauthorized access.

#### Source Code Analysis
The vulnerability is not within the library's source code itself (`/code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/chat_v1.py`, `/code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/chat_v2.py`, `/code/python/src/grafana_openai_monitoring/__handlers.py`). The library's code correctly uses parameters for credentials, allowing for secure configuration.

The vulnerability is introduced by the **insecure examples provided in the README files**.

- **File: `/code/README.md`, `/code/python/README.md`, `/code/node/README.md`**
    - These files contain usage examples in Python and JavaScript that explicitly show how to hardcode sensitive credentials:

    ```python
    client = OpenAI(
        api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    )

    client.chat.completions.create = chat_v2.monitor(
        client.chat.completions.create,
        metrics_url="YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL",
        logs_url="YOUR_LOKI_LOGS_URL",
        metrics_username="YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME",
        logs_username="YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME",
        access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    )
    ```

    ```javascript
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
    });

    const monitoringOptions = {
      metrics_url: 'YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL',
      logs_url: 'YOUR_LOKI_LOGS_URL',
      metrics_username: 'YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME',
      logs_username: 'YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME',
      access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    };

    chat_v2.monitor(openai, monitoringOptions);
    ```

    - The placeholders `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL"`, etc., are intended to be replaced by actual user credentials. However, the documentation does not adequately emphasize that hardcoding these values directly in the code is insecure and should be avoided. Users who are new to security best practices might follow these examples literally and unintentionally expose their credentials.

- **File: `/code/python/tests/test_chat_v1.py`, `/code/python/tests/test_chat_v2.py`**
    - These test files demonstrate the correct and secure way to handle credentials by loading them from environment variables using `os.getenv()`. This secure approach is not highlighted or recommended in the main README usage examples.

#### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
    - Create a public GitHub repository.
    - Follow the Python or JavaScript usage example from the README.md file (e.g., `/code/README.md`).
    - In the example code, replace the placeholders `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL"`, `"YOUR_LOKI_LOGS_URL"`, `"YOUR_METRICS_USERNAME"`, `"YOUR_LOGS_USERNAME"`, and `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` with **valid but intentionally created for testing** OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access token. **Do not use your real production credentials.**
    - Commit and push the code to the public GitHub repository.
2. **Simulate Attacker Action:**
    - As an attacker, access the public GitHub repository created in step 1.
    - Browse the repository's source code and locate the file where the credentials were hardcoded.
    - Extract the hardcoded OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access token.
3. **Verify OpenAI API Access (using the extracted OpenAI API Key):**
    - Use the extracted OpenAI API key to make a simple request to the OpenAI API (e.g., using `curl` or Python's `openai` library):
      ```bash
      curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_EXTRACTED_OPENAI_API_KEY"
      ```
    - If the API call is successful and returns a list of models, it confirms that the extracted API key is valid and can be used to access the OpenAI API.
4. **Verify Grafana Cloud Access (using the extracted Grafana Cloud Access Token):**
    - Use the extracted Grafana Cloud access token to attempt to access Grafana Cloud resources (e.g., using `curl` to query Prometheus metrics endpoint):
      ```bash
      curl -u "YOUR_EXTRACTED_METRICS_USERNAME:YOUR_EXTRACTED_ACCESS_TOKEN" "YOUR_PROMETHEUS_METRICS_URL/api/v1/query?query=up"
      ```
    - If the API call is successful and returns metrics data, it confirms that the extracted access token is valid and can be used to access Grafana Cloud.
5. **Cleanup:**
    - **Immediately invalidate or rotate the test OpenAI API key and Grafana Cloud access token** used in this test to prevent any potential misuse.
    - Remove the public GitHub repository or remove the hardcoded credentials commit from the repository's history to prevent accidental exposure.

This test case demonstrates that by following the provided examples and hardcoding credentials, an attacker can easily extract and misuse these credentials if the code becomes accessible.
