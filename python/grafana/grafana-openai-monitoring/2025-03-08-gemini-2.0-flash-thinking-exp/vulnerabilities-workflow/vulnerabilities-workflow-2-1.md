### Vulnerability 1: Hardcoded OpenAI API Key in User Code

- **Vulnerability Name**: Hardcoded OpenAI API Key
- **Description**:
    - The documentation and examples provided in the `README.md`, `/code/python/README.md`, and `/code/node/README.md` files instruct users to replace the placeholder string `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with their actual OpenAI API key directly in the code.
    - A user following these examples might inadvertently hardcode their OpenAI API key within their application code.
    - If this code is then committed to a public version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), the OpenAI API key becomes publicly accessible.
    - An attacker can then discover this exposed API key by browsing public repositories or using automated tools that scan for secrets.
- **Impact**:
    - **Unauthorized OpenAI API Access**: An attacker who obtains the exposed OpenAI API key can impersonate the legitimate user and make requests to the OpenAI API.
    - **Financial Cost**: The attacker can consume the user's OpenAI API credits, leading to unexpected financial charges for the legitimate user.
    - **Data Access**: Depending on the scope of the API key, the attacker might be able to access or manipulate data associated with the user's OpenAI account.
    - **Service Disruption**:  Malicious use of the API key by an attacker could lead to rate limiting or suspension of the user's OpenAI API access, disrupting their services.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The project does not implement any technical controls to prevent users from hardcoding API keys. The documentation examples actually encourage this practice by directly showing how to insert the API key string.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Documentation Warning**: The documentation should include a prominent and explicit warning against hardcoding API keys directly in the code. It should clearly explain the security risks associated with this practice.
    - **Best Practices Guidance**: The documentation should guide users on secure methods for managing API keys, such as:
        - Using environment variables to store API keys outside of the codebase.
        - Utilizing secure configuration management tools or secret management services.
        - Avoiding committing API keys to version control systems.
    - **Code Example Improvement**: The code examples in the documentation should be updated to demonstrate loading the OpenAI API key from environment variables instead of hardcoding it as a string literal. For example, in Python:
      ```python
      import os
      from openai import OpenAI
      from grafana_openai_monitoring import chat_v2

      client = OpenAI(
          api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
      )
      ```
      And in Javascript:
      ```javascript
      import OpenAI from 'openai';
      import { chat_v2 } from 'grafana-openai-monitoring';

      const openai = new OpenAI({
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      });
      ```
- **Preconditions**:
    - A user implements the `grafana-openai-monitoring` library in their application.
    - The user follows the documentation examples and hardcodes their OpenAI API key directly into their source code.
    - The user commits the source code containing the hardcoded API key to a public version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - **File: /code/README.md, /code/python/README.md, /code/node/README.md**
    - The usage examples in these README files explicitly show how to initialize the OpenAI client with the API key as a hardcoded string:
      ```python
      client = OpenAI(
          api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
      )
      ```
      ```javascript
      const openai = new OpenAI({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
      });
      ```
    - These examples, while demonstrating basic usage, directly suggest hardcoding the API key without sufficient security warnings. This makes it easy for developers to unknowingly introduce this vulnerability.
- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create a new public repository on GitHub or GitLab.
        - Create a Python file (e.g., `monitor_openai.py`) in this repository based on the example provided in `/code/python/README.md`.
        - In the `monitor_openai.py` file, replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with a **dummy** API key (e.g., `"INSECURE_HARDCODED_API_KEY_123"`).  **Do not use a real OpenAI API key.**
        - Complete the rest of the example by adding dummy Grafana Cloud credentials and a sample OpenAI API call.
    2. **Commit and Push**:
        - Commit the `monitor_openai.py` file to the public repository.
        - Push the commit to the remote repository on GitHub/GitLab.
    3. **Verification (Simulating Attacker)**:
        - Open a new browser session or use a different machine where you are not logged into the repository.
        - Navigate to the public repository you created.
        - Browse the code and open the `monitor_openai.py` file.
        - **Observe**: You will be able to clearly see the dummy API key `"INSECURE_HARDCODED_API_KEY_123"` hardcoded in the code, demonstrating how easily an attacker could find a real hardcoded API key if a user were to mistakenly commit one.
    4. **Impact Demonstration (Optional - Do not use a real key)**:
        - If you had used a real OpenAI API key (which you should **not** do for security reasons in a public test), an attacker could take the following steps:
            - Copy the exposed API key.
            - Use the OpenAI Python or Javascript library, or any OpenAI API client, and configure it to use the stolen API key.
            - Make requests to the OpenAI API using the stolen key.
            - Verify that the requests are successful, demonstrating unauthorized access and potential cost incurrence on the victim's OpenAI account.

This test case demonstrates that by following the documentation examples and committing code to a public repository, a user can easily expose their OpenAI API key, allowing unauthorized access by attackers.
