- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Webhook Handling in Example Code
- Description:
    1. A developer implements a webhook handler in their application using the example code provided in the Lightspark Python SDK (e.g., `flask_webhook_server.py`).
    2. The developer might directly use the example code's structure, which includes webhook verification using `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse`.
    3. However, the example code does not explicitly guide developers on securely storing and managing the `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Developers might hardcode the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` directly in their application code or use insecure environment variable practices, making it easier to compromise.
    4. Furthermore, even with signature verification in place, the example code lacks explicit guidance on further validating the parsed webhook event data before acting upon it. A malicious attacker could potentially manipulate the webhook payload to contain unexpected or malicious data, and if the developer's handler doesn't perform sufficient input validation *after* signature verification, it could lead to unintended actions within their application or Lightspark account.
    5. An attacker could potentially send crafted webhook requests to the application's webhook endpoint. If the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is compromised or if input validation is missing after signature verification, the attacker could successfully inject malicious webhook events.
- Impact:
    - If the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is compromised, attackers can bypass signature verification and inject arbitrary webhook events.
    - If input validation is missing in the webhook handler after verification, attackers can manipulate webhook data (e.g., `event_type`, `entity_id`, `wallet_id`) to trigger unintended actions within the developer's application logic, possibly leading to:
        - Unauthorized access to Lightspark account information.
        - Manipulation of payment processing logic, potentially leading to financial loss.
        - Triggering unintended actions on the Lightspark node or wallet.
        - Data breaches if webhook data is mishandled or logged insecurely after successful injection.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Signature verification is implemented in the `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` method in `/code/lightspark/webhooks.py`. This function checks the `lightspark-signature` header against the webhook body and the configured `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Guidance on Secure `WEBHOOK_SECRET` Management:** The example code and documentation should strongly emphasize the importance of securely storing and managing the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` and explicitly discourage hardcoding it or using insecure environment variable practices. It should recommend secure secret management solutions (e.g., vault, secure environment variable handling).
    - **Input Validation Guidance:** The example code and documentation should include clear guidance and best practices for validating webhook event data *after* successful signature verification. This should highlight the importance of checking the `event_type`, `entity_id`, `wallet_id`, and other relevant fields to ensure they conform to expected values and formats before processing the event.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer implements a webhook handler in their application and exposes it publicly.
    - The developer uses the example code as a base without implementing secure `WEBHOOK_SECRET` management or sufficient input validation after signature verification.
    - The application is intended to perform actions based on webhook events, such as updating internal systems or processing payments.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`/code/lightspark/webhooks.py`**:
        - The `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` function correctly implements signature verification using `hmac.new` and `hashlib.sha256`.
        - It raises a `ValueError` if the signature doesn't match, which is a good security practice.
        - The `WebhookEvent.parse` function parses the JSON data into a `WebhookEvent` object.
    - **`/code/examples/flask_webhook_server.py`**:
        - The example Flask app at `/lightspark-webhook` route uses `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` for signature verification, which is correct.
        - However, the example only prints basic information from the event (`event.data.id`, `event.data.wallet_status`, `event.data.amount`) and lacks any input validation after parsing.
        - The `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is hardcoded as `"CHANGE_ME"`, which is insecure and serves as a bad example for developers.
    - **Missing Guidance**:
        - Neither the example code nor the provided files contain explicit warnings or recommendations about secure secret management and input validation after webhook signature verification.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy an instance of the Flask webhook server example (`flask_webhook_server.py`). Replace `"CHANGE_ME"` with a known `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for testing purposes. Ensure this instance is publicly accessible for testing.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:**
        - Create a valid webhook payload (JSON data) mimicking a legitimate Lightspark webhook event (e.g., `NODE_STATUS`).
        - Modify the payload to contain malicious data in fields like `event.data.id` or other relevant fields that the webhook handler might process. For example, change `event.data.wallet_status` to a malicious string or inject unexpected characters.
    3. **Calculate Invalid Signature (or Bypass if Secret is Known):**
        - **Scenario 1 (Secret Unknown):**  Intentionally calculate an *invalid* `lightspark-signature` header for the crafted malicious payload.
        - **Scenario 2 (Secret Known - for testing):** Calculate a *valid* `lightspark-signature` header for the crafted malicious payload using the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` used in the deployed Flask app.
    4. **Send Malicious Request:**
        - Send a POST request to the deployed Flask app's `/lightspark-webhook` endpoint.
        - Include the crafted malicious payload in the request body.
        - In Scenario 1, include the invalid signature in the `lightspark-signature` header.
        - In Scenario 2, include the valid signature in the `lightspark-signature` header.
    5. **Observe Behavior:**
        - **Scenario 1 (Invalid Signature):** Verify that the Flask app correctly rejects the request with a 400 or 401 error due to signature verification failure.
        - **Scenario 2 (Valid Signature):** Observe the application's behavior. If the application processes the malicious data from the payload *without* further input validation after signature verification, this confirms the vulnerability. For example, check logs or application state to see if the malicious data (e.g., manipulated `event.data.id`) is processed or reflected in any way.
