### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: API Key Hardcoding in Example Code
- Description:
    1. The Lightspark Python SDK example code (`example.py` in `README.md`) instructs users to "update the variables at the top of the page with your information".
    2. This instruction, combined with the nature of API keys as sensitive credentials, can lead developers to directly hardcode their Lightspark API keys (client ID and client secret) within the `example.py` file or similar application code during initial setup and testing.
    3. If developers fail to migrate these hardcoded API keys to secure configuration management practices (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration files, or secrets management systems) before deploying their applications, the API keys become exposed within the application's codebase.
    4. Attackers who gain access to the application's source code repository (e.g., through accidental public exposure of a private repository, insider threat, or compromised development environment) or to the deployed application's files (e.g., through server-side vulnerabilities) can extract the hardcoded API keys.
    5. With valid API keys, attackers can then impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to their Lightspark account and associated resources, potentially leading to financial loss, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to user's Lightspark account.
    - Potential financial loss due to unauthorized transactions.
    - Data breaches and exposure of sensitive information related to the Lightspark account.
    - Reputational damage for both the user and Lightspark.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself. The SDK does offer secure signing mechanisms for node operations, but this vulnerability is about API key management at the application level, which is outside the SDK's direct control.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Security Best Practices Documentation:**  The documentation should explicitly warn against hardcoding API keys and strongly recommend secure alternatives like environment variables or secrets management systems. This should be prominently featured in the "Sample Code" section and Getting Started guides.
    - **Example Code Enhancement:** While providing a functional example is helpful, the example code itself could be modified to read API keys from environment variables instead of directly prompting for variable updates in the file. This would promote secure practices from the outset.
    - **Security Warning in README:** A clear security warning in the README file, near the "Sample Code" section, emphasizing the risks of hardcoding API keys and pointing to secure alternatives, would increase user awareness.
- Preconditions:
    - Developers using the Lightspark Python SDK follow the example code instructions without implementing secure API key management practices.
    - Attackers gain access to the application's codebase or deployed application files.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
    ```markdown
    ## Sample code

    For your convenience, we included an example that shows you how to use the SDK.
    Open the file `example.py` and make sure to update the variables at the top of the page with your information, then run it using pipenv:

    ```python
    pipenv install
    pipenv run python -m examples.example
    ```
    ```
    - The README.md file guides users to the `example.py` file and instructs them to "update the variables at the top of the page with your information". This is a potential point where developers might directly input API keys into the example file if not explicitly warned against it.
    - File: `/code/examples/example.py` (Hypothetical, not provided in PROJECT FILES, but based on README instructions)
    ```python
    # examples/example.py
    import lightspark
    import os

    api_token_client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"  # ðŸš¨ POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded API Key
    api_token_client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" # ðŸš¨ POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded API Secret

    client = lightspark.LightsparkSyncClient(
        api_token_client_id=api_token_client_id,
        api_token_client_secret=api_token_client_secret,
    )

    # ... rest of the example code ...
    ```
    - The `example.py` file (based on typical example code structure and the README instructions) likely contains placeholders for API keys, which users might replace with their actual credentials directly in the code, leading to hardcoding.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a Lightspark account and generate API keys.
        - Download the Lightspark Python SDK.
        - Create a Python project and install the Lightspark SDK.
        - Create an `example.py` file in your project, mimicking the structure suggested by the README, including variables for `api_token_client_id` and `api_token_client_secret`.
        - Hardcode your Lightspark API client ID and secret directly into the `example.py` file.
        - Initialize a Git repository for your project and commit the `example.py` file with the hardcoded API keys.
        - Push the Git repository to a *private* GitHub repository (to simulate accidental public exposure later).
    2. **Simulate Attacker Access:**
        - Simulate an attacker gaining access to the GitHub repository (e.g., imagine accidentally making the private repository public or an insider threat).
        - The attacker clones the repository and inspects the `example.py` file.
        - The attacker extracts the hardcoded `api_token_client_id` and `api_token_client_secret` from `example.py`.
    3. **Exploit:**
        - The attacker uses the extracted API keys to instantiate a `LightsparkSyncClient` in a separate Python script or tool.
        - The attacker uses the client to execute actions on the Lightspark API, such as fetching account information or initiating payments, thus demonstrating unauthorized access.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Verify that the attacker can successfully access the Lightspark account and perform actions using the extracted hardcoded API keys. This confirms the vulnerability.
