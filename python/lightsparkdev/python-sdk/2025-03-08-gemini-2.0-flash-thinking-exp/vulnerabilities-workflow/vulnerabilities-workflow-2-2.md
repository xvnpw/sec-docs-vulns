- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Webhook Handling due to Missing Input Validation
- Description:
    - An attacker can craft a malicious webhook request containing arbitrary data in the webhook event payload.
    - An application, adopting the example Flask web server code from the Lightspark Python SDK, receives this webhook request.
    - The application uses the `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` function from the SDK to verify the signature of the webhook, which succeeds as the attacker can generate a valid signature if they know or guess the webhook secret (or if the secret is weak or default).
    - After successful signature verification, the application parses the webhook payload into a `WebhookEvent` object.
    - The application then proceeds to process the data from the parsed `WebhookEvent` object (e.g., `event.entity_id`, `event.wallet_id`, `event.event_type`) without performing any input validation or sanitization.
    - If this data is used in a vulnerable manner, such as in constructing database queries, executing system commands, or in other sensitive operations, it can lead to security vulnerabilities like injection attacks or other forms of data manipulation.
- Impact:
    - The impact varies depending on how the application processes the unvalidated webhook data.
    - Potential impacts include:
        - Information Disclosure: If malicious input can be used to query or access sensitive data.
        - Data Manipulation: If malicious input can be used to modify data within the application's system.
        - System Compromise: In severe cases, if input is used in system commands, it could potentially lead to remote command execution or other forms of system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Signature verification using `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` in `lightspark/webhooks.py` ensures the webhook originates from Lightspark, mitigating risks from unauthorized sources.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Missing input validation and sanitization of webhook event data within the example Flask webhook handler and in general guidance for developers using the SDK.
    - Lack of emphasis in documentation on the importance of validating webhook data after signature verification.
- Preconditions:
    - An application is deployed that uses the example Flask webhook server code or similar webhook handling logic from the Lightspark Python SDK.
    - The application uses the `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` function for signature verification.
    - The application processes webhook event data without implementing sufficient input validation after signature verification.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `lightspark/webhooks.py`: The `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` function correctly implements signature verification using HMAC-SHA256, ensuring message integrity and origin authenticity.
    - `lightspark/webhooks.py`: The `WebhookEvent.parse` function deserializes the JSON webhook payload into a `WebhookEvent` object, but does not perform any validation on the data itself.
    - `examples/flask_webhook_server.py`: The example Flask application at `/lightspark-webhook` route uses `WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` for signature verification.
    - `examples/flask_webhook_server.py`: **Critically, the example code directly accesses attributes of the parsed `WebhookEvent` object (e.g., `event.data.id`, `event.data.wallet_status`) without any input validation before processing them.** This illustrates a potentially insecure pattern if developers directly adopt this example and use webhook data in sensitive operations without adding validation.
- Security Test Case:
    - Deploy a Flask application based on `examples/flask_webhook_server.py` to a publicly accessible instance.
    - Configure a webhook in the Lightspark dashboard to send events to the deployed Flask application's `/lightspark-webhook` endpoint.
    - Craft a malicious webhook payload in JSON format. For example, create a payload where:
        ```json
        {
          "event_type": "NODE_STATUS",
          "event_id": "test_event",
          "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "entity_id": "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
          "wallet_id": "test_wallet"
        }
        ```
        In this payload, the `entity_id` is crafted to contain a SQL injection string.
    - Obtain the webhook secret configured in the Lightspark dashboard for your application.
    - Calculate the HMAC-SHA256 signature of the malicious payload using the webhook secret and the `lightspark.WebhookEvent.verify_and_parse` method (or a similar HMAC-SHA256 calculation).
    - Send a POST request to the deployed Flask application's `/lightspark-webhook` endpoint:
        - Set the `lightspark-signature` header to the calculated signature.
        - Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
        - Set the request body to the malicious JSON payload.
    - Observe the application's behavior. If the application logs or processes the `entity_id` directly without validation, it will process the malicious SQL injection string. For instance, if the application logs the `entity_id`, the logs will contain the injection attempt.
    - If the application were to use the `entity_id` in a SQL query (which is not the case in the example, but represents a realistic scenario in applications), this test case could demonstrate successful SQL injection if no input validation is in place.
