## Vulnerability Report

### Malicious URL Injection via Crafted Commit SHA

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker sends a message to the IRC channel that contains a string that matches the regular expression for commit SHAs (`github_sha_re`), but is actually a crafted malicious URL. For example, a string like `example.com%2Fabcdefg` or `phishing.example.com`.
    2. The `get_matches` function extracts this crafted string as a potential commit SHA because it matches the defined pattern.
    3. The `get_links` function then takes this extracted string and substitutes it directly into the `github_changeset_url` template: `"https://github.com/django/django/commit/%s"`.
    4. If the crafted string is `example.com%2Fabcdefg`, the resulting URL becomes `https://github.com/django/django/commit/example.com%2Fabcdefg`.
    5. The `validate_sha_github` function is called to validate this URL by sending a HEAD request. If a website exists at `https://github.com/django/django/commit/example.com%2Fabcdefg` and returns a 200 status code (which is highly unlikely for github.com, but possible with a specifically set up malicious server or due to a misconfiguration), the validation will pass. Even if validation fails or times out, the bot will still generate the link if `sha_validation` returns True for any reason or the check is bypassed.
    6. The bot then sends a message to the IRC channel containing this crafted URL.
    7. When a user clicks on this link, they might be redirected to an unexpected or malicious website, depending on the crafted string. In a more direct attack, the attacker could craft a string that, when URL-encoded and placed in the `%s` of `github_changeset_url`, results in a redirect to a phishing or malware site, even if the initial part of the URL looks like it's on `github.com`.

- **Impact:**
    - Users clicking on the crafted URLs could be redirected to phishing websites, malware download sites, or other malicious content. This can lead to credential theft, malware infection, or other security breaches for users who trust and interact with the IRC bot's output.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `validate_sha_github` function attempts to validate commit SHAs by checking if the constructed GitHub URL returns a 200 status code. This is implemented in the `get_links` function in `/code/ticketbot.py`.
    ```python
    def validate_sha_github(sha):
        """
        Make sure the given SHA belong to the Django tree.
        Works by making a request to the github repo.
        """
        r = requests.head(github_changeset_url % sha)
        return r.status_code == 200


    def get_links(match_set, sha_validation=validate_sha_github):
        # ...
        for c in match_set.github_changesets:
            if sha_validation and sha_validation(c): # Mitigation attempt
                links.append(github_changeset_url % c)
        return links
    ```
    - However, this mitigation is insufficient because:
        - It only checks for HTTP status 200, not the actual content or safety of the URL. A malicious actor could potentially set up a server to respond with a 200 OK to any request at a specific path to bypass this check.
        - The validation only applies to commit SHAs, not to ticket IDs or PR IDs, even though similar injection vulnerabilities could exist for them if the URL patterns were different.
        - If `sha_validation` fails or times out, the code logic might still proceed to generate the link depending on how errors are handled (though in the current code, it just skips appending the link if validation fails).

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The bot lacks proper input validation and sanitization for the extracted ticket IDs, commit SHAs, and PR IDs. It should validate that these extracted strings conform to expected formats and do not contain potentially harmful characters or URL components. For commit SHAs, instead of just checking the URL, it should validate the format of the SHA string itself to ensure it's a valid hexadecimal string of the expected length before constructing the URL. For ticket and PR IDs, ensure they are purely numeric.
    - **Output Encoding**: Before constructing the URLs and sending them to the IRC channel, the extracted strings should be properly URL-encoded to prevent interpretation of special characters in unintended ways. However, in this specific case, URL encoding might not prevent the injection if the attacker's payload is intended to be part of the URL path itself. Therefore, input validation is more critical.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Links (If Applicable)**: In this text-based IRC bot context, CSP is not directly applicable. However, if this bot were to generate HTML or rich text output in other contexts, CSP would be a relevant mitigation.
    - **Strict Regular Expressions**: While the current regexes are reasonably specific, they could be made even stricter to minimize the chance of matching unintended patterns. For example, for commit SHAs, explicitly defining the allowed characters and length more rigidly could help.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The IRC bot must be running and connected to an IRC channel where the attacker can send messages.
    - The bot must be configured to process messages in the channel and generate links based on patterns.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Regex Matching in `get_matches`**:
       - The `github_sha_re` regex `r'(?:\s|^)([A-Fa-f0-9]{7,40})(?=\s|$)` is used to find potential commit SHAs.
       - This regex looks for a sequence of hexadecimal characters (7 to 40 characters long) that is either at the beginning of a line or preceded by whitespace, and either at the end of a line or followed by whitespace.
       - The vulnerability lies in the fact that this regex will match any string that *looks like* a SHA, even if it's a crafted malicious string.

       ```python
       github_sha_re = re.compile(r'(?:\s|^)([A-Fa-f0-9]{7,40})(?=\s|$)')

       def get_matches(message):
           # ...
           github_changesets = set(github_sha_re.findall(message)) # Vulnerable extraction
           # ...
           return MatchSet(tickets, github_changesets, github_PRs)
       ```

    2. **URL Construction in `get_links`**:
       - The `get_links` function takes the extracted `github_changesets` and directly substitutes them into the `github_changeset_url`.
       - The `sha_validation` function is called, but as described above, it's an insufficient mitigation.
       - Even if `sha_validation` was robust, the initial extraction in `get_matches` is flawed as it doesn't validate the *content* of the matched string beyond its format as a hexadecimal sequence.

       ```python
       github_changeset_url = "https://github.com/django/django/commit/%s"

       def get_links(match_set, sha_validation=validate_sha_github):
           links = []
           # ...
           for c in match_set.github_changesets: # Iterating over extracted 'SHAs'
               if sha_validation and sha_validation(c): # Insufficient validation
                   links.append(github_changeset_url % c) # Direct substitution - Vulnerability
           return links
       ```

    3. **Message Processing in `process_msg_or_privmsg`**:
       - The `process_msg_or_privmsg` function in the `Plugin` class orchestrates the process: it gets matches, gets links, and sends the links to the IRC channel.
       - It does not perform any additional validation or sanitization of the links before sending them.

       ```python
       @irc3.event(irc3.rfc.PRIVMSG)
       def process_msg_or_privmsg(self, mask, event, target, data, **kw):
           # ...
           matches = get_matches(data)
           links = get_links(matches) # Generates links with potential injections
           # ...
           self.bot.privmsg(to, ' '.join(links)) # Sends vulnerable links to IRC
       ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup**: Ensure the ticketbot is running and connected to a test IRC channel. You need to be able to send messages to this channel and observe the bot's responses.
    2. **Craft Malicious Message**: Prepare an IRC message containing a crafted string that matches the `github_sha_re` regex but is a malicious URL. For example: `test commit: malicious.example.com%2Fabcdefg`. Here, `malicious.example.com%2Fabcdefg` will be interpreted as the "commit SHA".
    3. **Send Message to IRC Channel**: Send the crafted message to the IRC channel where the bot is listening.
    4. **Observe Bot's Response**: Observe the bot's response in the IRC channel. The bot should generate a link based on the crafted message.
    5. **Verify Malicious Link**: Check if the generated link is `https://github.com/django/django/commit/malicious.example.com%2Fabcdefg`.
    6. **Click the Link (Safely)**: *For testing purposes only in a safe environment*, you can click on the generated link or inspect it to confirm that it leads to `https://github.com/django/django/commit/malicious.example.com%2Fabcdefg`. If `malicious.example.com` was set up to redirect to a phishing site or serve malware, this would demonstrate the vulnerability. In a real test, you would check the generated URL without clicking it directly, perhaps by examining the bot's output logs or intercepting the IRC messages.

    **Expected Result**: The bot should generate and send an IRC message containing the link `https://github.com/django/django/commit/malicious.example.com%2Fabcdefg`, demonstrating that the malicious string was injected into the URL. This confirms the URL injection vulnerability.
