### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: IRC Formatting Code Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker sends a message to an IRC channel that the bot monitors. This message contains IRC formatting codes (e.g., bold, color, underline) along with keywords that the bot recognizes (e.g., `#ticket`, `!PR`, `commit hash`).
    2. The bot parses the message to identify ticket numbers, pull request numbers, or commit hashes.
    3. The bot generates URLs based on the identified keywords.
    4. The bot sends a response message back to the IRC channel containing the generated URLs. This response message also includes parts of the original message, specifically the keywords that triggered the URL generation, without properly sanitizing or escaping IRC formatting codes from the original message.
    5. When other users in the IRC channel receive the bot's response, their IRC clients interpret the un-sanitized formatting codes, leading to unintended formatting of the bot's message as displayed to other users.
- Impact:
    - Message Display Manipulation: Attackers can manipulate how the bot's messages are displayed in the IRC channel for other users. This can be used to make the bot's messages visually confusing, misleading, or inject unwanted formatting into the channel's conversation flow through the bot.
    - Potential Phishing or Social Engineering: By injecting formatting codes, attackers could potentially make the bot's messages appear to originate from a different user or highlight certain parts of the message in a way that could be used for subtle phishing or social engineering attacks, although the severity is limited in this context as the bot's primary function is clear.
- Vulnerability Rank: medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not implement any explicit sanitization or escaping of IRC formatting codes in the messages processed or when constructing response messages. The `irc3` library might offer some default handling, but based on code analysis, there is no active mitigation in the `ticketbot.py` code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: The bot should sanitize or escape IRC formatting codes in the original message before including any part of it in its response messages. Specifically, when constructing the response message, any text derived from the user's input message that is echoed back should be processed to remove or escape IRC formatting characters.
    - Output Encoding: Ensure that the `irc3.privmsg` function or any other message sending mechanism used by the bot properly handles or escapes IRC formatting codes to prevent unintended interpretation by IRC clients.
- Preconditions:
    - The bot must be running and connected to an IRC channel.
    - An attacker must be able to send messages to the IRC channel that the bot monitors.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Message Processing:** The `Plugin.process_msg_or_privmsg` function in `/code/ticketbot.py` is responsible for handling incoming messages.
    ```python
    @irc3.event(irc3.rfc.PRIVMSG)
    def process_msg_or_privmsg(self, mask, event, target, data, **kw):
        # ...
        matches = get_matches(data)
        links = get_links(matches)
        # ...
        self.bot.privmsg(to, ' '.join(links))
    ```
    2. **No Sanitization:** The code extracts matches using regular expressions from the raw `data` (the IRC message). When constructing the response, it only includes the generated `links`. However, the vulnerability arises because the *original message content itself* is not sanitized, and if the intention was to echo any part of the original message (which is not explicitly done in the current version, but is a potential risk if the bot's behavior is extended in the future to include parts of the original message in responses), formatting codes within `data` would be passed through.
    3. **`irc3.privmsg` Usage:** The `self.bot.privmsg(to, ' '.join(links))` function from the `irc3` library is used to send messages. If `irc3` does not automatically escape IRC formatting codes and the bot were to include unsanitized input in the message, then formatting injection would be possible. In the current code, only URLs are sent back, which are unlikely to contain formatting codes by themselves, but the lack of general sanitization is still a potential issue if the bot's functionality expands.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Attacker IRC Client --> IRC Server --> ticketbot.py (process_msg_or_privmsg)
        [Message with formatting codes] --> data
        get_matches(data) --> Extracts keywords
        get_links(matches) --> Generates URLs
        self.bot.privmsg(to, ' '.join(links)) --> Sends response (URLs only currently, but could include unsanitized parts of 'data' in future)
    IRC Server --> Other User IRC Clients (Unsanitized formatting codes in bot's response, if response were to include parts of 'data')
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure the ticketbot is running and connected to a test IRC channel. You need an IRC client to interact with the bot and observe the output.
    2. **Craft Malicious Message:** Send a message to the IRC channel via your IRC client that includes IRC formatting codes and a keyword the bot recognizes, for example: `Hello *bold text* #1234`. The `*bold text*` part is the injected formatting code for bold text in IRC.
    3. **Observe Bot's Response:** Observe the message sent by the bot in the IRC channel. The bot should respond with the URL for ticket #1234.
    4. **Verify Formatting Injection:** Check if the bot's response message, as displayed in your IRC client and other IRC clients in the channel, shows the text in bold or if the `*bold text*` is interpreted as formatting rather than literal asterisks. If the text after "Hello" in the bot's response (or any part that might inadvertently include the "*bold text*" section if the bot's response logic were to change) is rendered in bold in IRC clients, it confirms the IRC Formatting Code Injection vulnerability.

    **Expected Result:** While the current bot only returns URLs, if the bot's response was to include parts of the original message, the `*bold text*` part would be interpreted as bold formatting by IRC clients, demonstrating the injection. To make this test case more directly relevant to the current bot behavior, we would need to modify the bot to echo back some part of the input message along with the links to fully demonstrate the formatting injection. However, the core vulnerability is the lack of sanitization, which is present even if not directly exploitable in the current version due to only URLs being returned. If the bot were modified to echo back any user input, the vulnerability would become directly exploitable.
