### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Benchmarks

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker forks the repository.
    2.  The attacker creates a new directory under `/benchmarks/`, for example, `benchmarks/malicious_benchmark`.
    3.  Inside this directory, the attacker creates two files: `__init__.py` (can be empty) and `benchmark.py`.
    4.  The attacker crafts `benchmark.py` to contain malicious Python code. This code can perform any action the developer's user has permissions to execute, such as running system commands, reading/writing files, or establishing a reverse shell. For example, a simple malicious benchmark could be designed to create a file in the `/tmp` directory to demonstrate code execution.
    5.  The attacker submits a pull request to the main repository with these changes, including the malicious benchmark.
    6.  A developer, wanting to contribute or review the benchmarks, clones the attacker's branch and navigates to the `/code` directory.
    7.  The developer installs `asv` and any other necessary dependencies as described in the `README.md`.
    8.  The developer executes the command `asv run` to run the benchmarks locally.
    9.  `asv` automatically discovers and executes the benchmark code located in `benchmark.py` files, including the malicious benchmark introduced by the attacker.
    10. The malicious code within `benchmark.py` is executed on the developer's machine, achieving arbitrary code execution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.
    *   This can lead to a full compromise of the developer's local environment, including:
        *   Data theft: Access to sensitive files, credentials, and development code.
        *   Malware installation: Installation of backdoors, keyloggers, or other malicious software.
        *   Supply chain compromise: Potential to inject malicious code into the developer's contributions, which could later be merged into the main Django project.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The project lacks any specific security measures to prevent the execution of arbitrary code from benchmarks.
    *   The `README.md` provides instructions for contributing, which implicitly suggests code review as part of the pull request process. However, there is no explicit mention of security-focused code review or guidelines to prevent malicious benchmarks.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Code Review Process with Security Focus:** Implement a mandatory and rigorous code review process specifically focused on identifying and preventing malicious code in contributed benchmarks. This review should be performed by security-aware personnel.
    *   **Sandboxed Benchmark Execution:** Execute benchmarks in a sandboxed environment, such as a container (Docker, Podman) or a virtual machine. This would limit the impact of any malicious code execution by isolating the benchmark environment from the developer's host system.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While less applicable to code execution itself, consider if there are any inputs to the benchmark setup or execution process that could be validated or sanitized to reduce risk. In this specific case, the primary risk is the code itself, so input sanitization is less relevant than sandboxing and code review.
    *   **Automated Security Checks:** Integrate automated security scanning tools or linters into the development workflow to detect potentially malicious patterns or suspicious code within benchmarks before they are executed.
    *   **Security Documentation and Developer Guidelines:** Create clear security documentation that outlines the risks of running benchmarks from untrusted sources and provides guidelines for developers on how to review and handle benchmark contributions securely. Warn developers about the potential for arbitrary code execution and advise caution when running benchmarks from forked repositories or pull requests.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit a pull request to the repository (or convince a developer to clone and run their malicious branch).
    *   A developer needs to clone the attacker's branch, install `asv`, and execute the `asv run` command locally.
    *   The developer must have write permissions in their local environment for the malicious code to have a significant impact (e.g., to create files, install software, etc.).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`README.md`**: The "Writing New Benchmarks And Contributing" section clearly outlines how to add new benchmarks by creating a directory and `benchmark.py` file. It also instructs to add the directory to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.
    2.  **`benchmarks/utils.py`**: The `bench_setup()` function is used across benchmarks. While it sets up the Django environment, it doesn't inherently introduce the vulnerability. It sets the stage for benchmark execution within a Django context.
    3.  **`asv run` command**: The `asv run` command, as documented in the `README.md` and the airspeed velocity tool documentation, is designed to discover and execute benchmarks within the project. It is expected behavior for `asv run` to execute the code in `benchmark.py` files.
    4.  **Lack of Sandboxing**: The project and `asv` tool, by default, execute benchmarks directly in the developer's environment without any sandboxing or isolation. This direct execution is the root cause of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
    5.  **No Security Checks**: There are no automated checks or security measures in place to validate the contents of `benchmark.py` files before execution.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Fork the `django-asv` repository.
        *   Clone your forked repository locally.
        *   Navigate to the `/code` directory.
        *   Create a new directory: `mkdir benchmarks/malicious_benchmark`.
        *   Create an empty `__init__.py` file in the new directory: `touch benchmarks/malicious_benchmark/__init__.py`.
        *   Create a `benchmark.py` file in the new directory with the following malicious code:

            ```python
            import os

            class MaliciousBenchmark:
                def setup(self):
                    os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')  # Malicious command to create a file
                    print("Malicious benchmark setup executed!")

                def time_noop(self): # Add a dummy benchmark function to be discovered by ASV
                    pass
            ```
        *   Edit `benchmarks/settings.py` and add `'benchmarks.malicious_benchmark'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

    2.  **Execution:**
        *   Install `asv`: `pip install asv`.
        *   Run the benchmarks: `asv run`.

    3.  **Verification:**
        *   After `asv run` completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on your system.
        *   If `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the malicious code in `benchmark.py` was executed successfully, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
        *   Observe the output of `asv run`. You should see the "Malicious benchmark setup executed!" message printed to the console, further confirming the execution of the malicious benchmark.

This test case demonstrates that simply adding a new benchmark file with malicious code and running `asv run` results in the execution of that code, confirming the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
