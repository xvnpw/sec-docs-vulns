### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Benchmarks

- **Description:**
    - An attacker can gain arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine by crafting a malicious benchmark within a forked version of this repository.
    - The attacker would first fork the `django-asv` repository.
    - Next, the attacker would modify a benchmark file (e.g., `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/benchmark.py`) or the `bench_setup` utility function (`/code/benchmarks/utils.py`) to include arbitrary Python code. This code could perform malicious actions.
    - The attacker then needs to socially engineer a Django developer into cloning and running benchmarks from this forked repository. This could be achieved by suggesting the developer test "performance improvements" in the forked repository.
    - Once the developer clones the forked repository and, following the project's instructions, executes the `asv run` command, the malicious code embedded within the benchmark files will be executed on their machine.
    - The `asv run` command is designed to execute the Python code found in the benchmark files to measure performance, and it does not inherently distinguish between benign benchmark code and malicious code.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
    - This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data exfiltration**: Sensitive information from the developer's machine or accessible networks could be stolen.
        - **Malware installation**: The attacker could install persistent malware, such as backdoors or ransomware, on the developer's system.
        - **Supply chain compromise**: If the developer has access to Django project infrastructure, this could be a stepping stone to further attacks on the Django project itself.
        - **Credential theft**: The attacker could steal credentials stored on the developer's machine, granting access to other systems and accounts.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The project currently lacks any implemented mitigations to prevent this type of vulnerability. The README.md provides instructions on how to run benchmarks, but does not include any security warnings about running code from untrusted sources.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Security Warning Documentation:** Add a prominent warning in the README.md and contribution guidelines about the security risks of running benchmarks from forked repositories or untrusted sources. This warning should advise developers to carefully review and understand the code before running `asv run`, especially from forked repositories.
    - **Code Review Process for Contributions:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all contributed benchmarks. This review should include a security assessment to detect any potentially malicious code before merging contributions.
    - **Sandboxing/Virtualization Recommendations:** Recommend or enforce the use of sandboxed environments (like Docker, VMs, or dedicated testing environments) for running benchmarks, especially when testing contributions from external sources. This would limit the potential impact of malicious code execution to the isolated environment.
    - **Static Analysis/Security Scanning:** Integrate static analysis tools or security scanners into the development workflow to automatically detect potentially suspicious code patterns in benchmark contributions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **Social Engineering:** The attacker must successfully socially engineer a Django developer to clone and run benchmarks from a forked repository controlled by the attacker.
    - **`asv` Installation:** The target developer must have `airspeed velocity` (asv) installed in their development environment.
    - **Execution of `asv run`:** The developer must execute the `asv run` command within the cloned forked repository.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability stems from the design of `asv` and the project's reliance on executing user-provided Python code for benchmarking.
    - **`asv run` Execution Flow:** When a developer executes `asv run`, `asv` discovers and executes benchmark classes and their methods within the project. This execution includes the `setup()` methods of benchmark classes, which are intended for setting up the benchmark environment.
    - **`/code/benchmarks/utils.py` - `bench_setup()` function:**
        ```python
        def bench_setup(migrate=False):
            try:
                os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "benchmarks.settings"
                django.setup()
            except RuntimeError:
                pass

            if migrate is True:
                call_command("migrate", run_syncdb=True, verbosity=0)
                try:
                    call_command("loaddata", "initial_data", verbosity=0)
                except CommandError as exc:
                    # Django 1.10+ raises if the file doesn't exist and not
                    # all benchmarks have files.
                    if "No fixture named" not in str(exc):
                        raise
        ```
        - This utility function is imported and used by almost all benchmark files in their `setup()` methods.
        - If an attacker modifies this function, the malicious code will be executed at the beginning of almost every benchmark run.
    - **Benchmark files (e.g., `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/benchmark.py`):**
        ```python
        from ...utils import bench_setup
        from .models import Book


        class ModelDelete:
            def setup(self):
                bench_setup(migrate=True) # Calls bench_setup, entry point for potential malicious code if utils.py is modified
                for i in range(10):
                    Book.objects.create(title=f"foobar{i}")

            def time_delete(self):
                for i in range(10):
                    Book.objects.filter(title=f"foobar{i}").delete()
        ```
        - The `setup()` method in benchmark classes is automatically executed by `asv run`.
        - An attacker can inject malicious code directly into the `setup()` method of any benchmark file.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the `django-asv` repository on your GitHub account.
    2. **Modify `benchmark.py` to Inject Malicious Code:**
        - Navigate to the `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/` directory in your forked repository.
        - Edit the `benchmark.py` file.
        - In the `setup()` method of the `ModelDelete` class, insert the following malicious code at the beginning of the method:
            ```python
            import os
            os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_benchmark_model_delete") # Creates a file as proof of execution
            ```
        - Save the modified `benchmark.py` file.
    3. **Alternatively, Modify `utils.py` to Inject Malicious Code:**
        - Navigate to the `/code/benchmarks/` directory in your forked repository.
        - Edit the `utils.py` file.
        - In the `bench_setup()` function, insert the following malicious code at the beginning of the function:
            ```python
            import os
            os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_bench_setup") # Creates a file as proof of execution
            ```
        - Save the modified `utils.py` file.
    4. **Clone the Forked Repository:** On a test machine (ideally a virtual machine or container to isolate potential damage), clone your forked repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/django-asv.git
        cd django-asv/code
        ```
    5. **Install `asv` and Run Benchmarks:** Follow the instructions in the README.md to set up the environment and run the benchmarks:
        ```bash
        pip install asv
        asv run
        ```
    6. **Verify Code Execution:** After `asv run` completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_benchmark_model_delete` (if you modified `benchmark.py`) or `/tmp/pwned_bench_setup` (if you modified `utils.py`) exists on the test machine.
        ```bash
        ls /tmp/pwned*
        ```
        - If the file exists, this confirms that the injected malicious code was successfully executed during the `asv run` process, demonstrating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights the risks associated with running code from untrusted sources, even in seemingly benign contexts like performance benchmarking. Developers should be educated about these risks and projects should implement appropriate security measures to mitigate them.
