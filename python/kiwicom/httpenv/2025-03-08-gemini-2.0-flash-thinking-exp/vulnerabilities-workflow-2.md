## Combined Vulnerability Report

The following vulnerability has been identified across multiple reports. After removing duplicates and filtering based on severity and exploitability, this represents a critical security flaw requiring immediate attention.

### Unauthenticated Access to Environment Variables

- **Description:**
    The `httpenv` service exposes endpoints `/v1/<name>` and `/v1/add/<name>/<value>` that are accessible without any authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker with network access to the service can retrieve any environment variable stored in the service by sending a simple GET request to `/v1/<variable_name>`. Additionally, an attacker can add or modify environment variables by sending a GET request to `/v1/add/<variable_name>/<variable_value>`.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Deploy the `httpenv` service and ensure it is accessible over the network.
    2. An attacker sends a GET request to `http://<service-address>/v1/add/TEST_VARIABLE/test_value` to add a variable named `TEST_VARIABLE` with the value `test_value`.
    3. The attacker sends a GET request to `http://<service-address>/v1/TEST_VARIABLE`.
    4. The service responds with the value of `TEST_VARIABLE`, which is `test_value`, demonstrating successful retrieval of the variable.
    5. An attacker can repeat step 3 with any variable name to attempt to retrieve its value, including potentially sensitive variables like API keys or passwords if they have been added to the service.

- **Impact:**
    Unauthorized retrieval of sensitive environment variables can lead to exposure of confidential information such as API keys, passwords, database credentials, and other secrets. This can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems and resources that rely on these credentials, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and other security incidents.  Furthermore, the ability to add or modify environment variables can be used to disrupt the application's intended behavior or inject malicious configurations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The service currently lacks any form of authentication or authorization. All endpoints are publicly accessible to anyone with network connectivity to the service.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    The service is missing essential security mitigations:
    - **Authentication:** Implementation of an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the requester before granting access to the endpoints. This could be basic authentication, API keys, or more robust methods like OAuth 2.0.
    - **Authorization:** Implementation of an authorization mechanism to control which users or roles are allowed to access or modify specific environment variables.  At the very least, restricting access to only authorized clients or internal networks.
    - **HTTPS:**  Enforcing HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and the service, protecting sensitive data in transit from eavesdropping.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `httpenv` service must be deployed and running.
    - The attacker must have network access to the deployed service.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `httpenv.py`:
        - The code defines two routes using the Bottle framework: `/v1/<name>` and `/v1/add/<name>/<value>`.
        - `@route('/v1/<name>')` decorator binds the `v1(name)` function to the `/v1/<name>` endpoint.
        - `@route('/v1/add/<name>/<value>')` decorator binds the `v1_add(name, value)` function to the `/v1/add/<name>/<value>` endpoint.
        - The `v1(name)` function retrieves the value of the environment variable `name` from the `envs` dictionary using `envs.get(name, '')` and returns it.
        - The `v1_add(name, value)` function adds a new entry to the `envs` dictionary with the key `name` and the value `value`.
        - **Crucially, neither `v1(name)` nor `v1_add(name, value)` functions, nor the route definitions, include any authentication or authorization checks.**  Any request to these endpoints will be processed without verifying the identity or permissions of the requester.
        - The `run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80, quiet=True)` function starts the Bottle development server, making it accessible on all network interfaces on port 80 by default, further exacerbating the vulnerability if deployed in a public network without proper network security controls.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Deploy the `httpenv` service to a server accessible over the network. You can use Docker to run the provided Dockerfile. For example:
        ```bash
        docker build -t httpenv-test /path/to/code
        docker run -d -p 8080:80 httpenv-test
        ```
        This will run the service on port 8080 of the host machine.

    2. **Add a test variable:** From a separate machine with network access to the deployed service, use `curl` or `wget` to send a request to add a test variable:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<service-address>:8080/v1/add/TEST_SECRET/my_secret_value"
        ```
        Replace `<service-address>` with the IP address or hostname of the server where httpenv is deployed.

    3. **Retrieve the test variable:** Send a request to retrieve the value of the `TEST_SECRET` variable:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<service-address>:8080/v1/TEST_SECRET"
        ```

    4. **Verify the response:** Observe the response from the service. It should be `my_secret_value`. This confirms that an attacker can successfully retrieve environment variables without authentication.

    5. **Retrieve a non-existent variable:** Send a request to retrieve a non-existent variable:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<service-address>:8080/v1/NON_EXISTENT_VARIABLE"
        ```

    6. **Verify the response:** Observe the response. It should be an empty string `""`, as defined in the `v1` function (`envs.get(name, '')`).

    7. **Add a sensitive variable:** Send a request to add a variable that could represent sensitive information, such as a password:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<service-address>:8080/v1/add/DB_PASSWORD/super_secret_password"
        ```

    8. **Retrieve the sensitive variable:** Send a request to retrieve the `DB_PASSWORD` variable:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<service-address>:8080/v1/DB_PASSWORD"
        ```

    9. **Verify the response:** Observe the response. It should be `super_secret_password`.  This demonstrates the critical vulnerability: an unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information stored as "environment variables" in this service.
