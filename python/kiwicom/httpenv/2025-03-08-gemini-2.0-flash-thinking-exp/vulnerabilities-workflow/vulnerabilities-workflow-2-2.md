### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Access to Environment Variables
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can send a GET request to the `/v1/<name>` endpoint of the `httpenv` service.
    2. The service, without any authentication or authorization, directly retrieves the environment variable associated with the provided `<name>` from its in-memory registry.
    3. The service returns the value of the environment variable in the HTTP response body.
    4. If sensitive information is stored as an environment variable and added to the registry, an attacker can retrieve it by guessing or knowing the variable name.
- **Impact:**
    - **High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive environment variables can lead to the exposure of critical secrets such as API keys, passwords, database credentials, and other confidential information.
    - This can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems and resources that rely on these secrets, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further malicious activities.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The provided code does not implement any form of authentication or access control.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Authentication:** Implement authentication to verify the identity of the requester before granting access to environment variables. This could be achieved through various methods such as API keys, tokens, or basic authentication.
    - **Authorization:** Implement authorization to control which users or services are allowed to access specific environment variables. This could involve role-based access control or more granular permission management.
    - **Network Security:** While not a mitigation within the application itself, deploying the service within a private network or using a firewall to restrict access from untrusted networks is a crucial security measure to limit exposure.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The `httpenv` service must be deployed and accessible over a network (e.g., publicly or within an organization's internal network).
    - Sensitive environment variables must have been added to the `httpenv` service using the `/v1/add/<name>/<value>` endpoint.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability exists in the `/code/httpenv.py` file.
    - The `v1(name)` function, decorated with `@route('/v1/<name>')`, is responsible for handling GET requests to retrieve environment variables.
    - ```python
      @route('/v1/<name>')
      def v1(name):
          return envs.get(name, '')
      ```
    - This function directly accesses the `envs` dictionary using `envs.get(name, '')` to retrieve the value associated with the provided `name`.
    - The `envs` dictionary is a simple in-memory dictionary initialized in the main block:
    - ```python
      if __name__ == '__main__':
          envs = {}
          run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80, quiet=True)
      ```
    - There are no checks or security mechanisms implemented before accessing and returning the value from the `envs` dictionary. Any request to the `/v1/<name>` endpoint will directly return the value of the corresponding environment variable if it exists in the `envs` dictionary.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        [Attacker] --> GET /v1/<variable_name> --> [httpenv Service] --> v1(name) function
                                                     |
                                                     |-- retrieves value from 'envs' dict without auth --> returns value
        [Attacker] <-- HTTP Response Body (value) <-- [httpenv Service]
        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy `httpenv` service:** Deploy the `httpenv.py` application, for example using Docker as described in the `README.md`. Ensure the service is accessible over HTTP.
    2. **Add a test secret:** Use `wget` or `curl` to add a test environment variable named `TEST_SECRET` with a sensitive value, for example `my_secret_value`:
       ```bash
       wget -qO- "http://<service-address>/v1/add/TEST_SECRET/my_secret_value"
       ```
       Replace `<service-address>` with the actual address of the deployed `httpenv` service (e.g., `localhost:8080` or the IP address if deployed remotely).
    3. **Attempt to retrieve the secret:** Use `wget` or `curl` to retrieve the value of `TEST_SECRET` without any authentication:
       ```bash
       wget -qO- "http://<service-address>/v1/TEST_SECRET"
       ```
    4. **Verify successful retrieval:** Check the output of the command in step 3. It should print `my_secret_value`, confirming that the secret was successfully retrieved without authentication.
    5. **Test non-existent variable:** Attempt to retrieve a non-existent variable to observe the default behavior:
       ```bash
       wget -qO- "http://<service-address>/v1/NON_EXISTENT_VARIABLE"
       ```
    6. **Verify empty response for non-existent variable:** Check the output of the command in step 5. It should be empty, confirming that the service returns an empty string when a variable is not found, as per the code (`envs.get(name, '')`).
