### Vulnerability 1: Unintentional Exposure of Service Account Credentials File

* Description:
    1. The `README.md` example code instructs users to create a `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file to store service account credentials.
    2. The example code then shows how to open and load this file using `open("google-serviceaccount-creds.json")` in the Python script.
    3. If users follow this example directly and do not take additional security measures, the `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file containing sensitive private keys might be unintentionally exposed.
    4. This exposure can occur if the file is committed to a public version control repository, left in a publicly accessible directory on a server, or shared insecurely.
    5. An attacker who gains access to this file can extract the service account credentials.

* Impact:
    - If the `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file is exposed and accessed by an attacker, they can obtain the private keys of the Google Cloud service account.
    - With these credentials, the attacker can impersonate the service account and gain unauthorized access to Google Cloud resources and services that the service account has permissions to access.
    - This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of resources, denial of service, and other security incidents within the Google Cloud environment associated with the compromised service account.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The library code itself does not handle the creation, storage, or security of the `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file. It only consumes the credentials provided as a Python dictionary. The `README.md` provides an example that, if followed without considering security implications, can lead to vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strong warning in documentation:** The documentation, especially the `README.md` example, should include a prominent warning about the security risks of storing service account credentials in a local JSON file named `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` within the project directory.
    - **Secure credential management guidance:** The documentation should advise users on more secure methods for managing service account credentials, such as:
        - Using environment variables to store the contents of the service account key instead of a file.
        - Leveraging Google Cloud's built-in secret management solutions like Secret Manager.
        - Emphasizing the importance of not committing the credentials file to version control and securing access to the file system where it is stored.
        - Suggesting alternative authentication methods where applicable, to minimize the need to handle raw service account keys directly.

* Preconditions:
    - The user follows the example in the `README.md` and creates a `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file to store service account credentials.
    - The user unintentionally makes the `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file publicly accessible (e.g., by committing it to a public repository, hosting it on a public web server, or insecure file sharing).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability stems from the example usage pattern presented in the `README.md` file, not directly from the Python code in `requests-iap` library.
    - `README.md` example:
        ```python
        with open("google-serviceaccount-creds.json") as f:
            service_account_secret_dict = json.load(f)

        resp = requests.get(
            "https://service.behind.iap.example.com",
            auth=IAPAuth(
                client_id=client_id,
                service_account_secret_dict=service_account_secret_dict,
            ),
        )
        ```
    - This example guides users to load credentials from a local file, which introduces the risk of unintentional exposure if the file is not handled securely by the user in their deployment environment.
    - The `iapauth.py` code correctly implements the authentication logic but relies on the `service_account_secret_dict` being passed securely to the `IAPAuth` class. The library itself does not enforce or guide secure credential management practices.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a dummy `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file with the following content (replace with placeholder values):
          ```json
          {
            "type": "service_account",
            "project_id": "your-project-id",
            "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
            "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_FAKE_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
            "client_email": "your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
            "client_id": "your-client-id",
            "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
            "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
            "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
            "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account-email%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
          }
          ```
        - Create a Python script `test_exploit.py` with the following content:
          ```python
          import requests
          from requests_iap import IAPAuth
          import json

          # Load credentials as shown in README example (vulnerable approach)
          with open("google-serviceaccount-creds.json") as f:
              service_account_secret_dict = json.load(f)

          client_id = "your-client-id" # Replace with a dummy client ID

          # Attempt to initialize IAPAuth (this step itself doesn't exploit, but shows the vulnerability setup)
          try:
              auth = IAPAuth(
                  client_id=client_id,
                  service_account_secret_dict=service_account_secret_dict,
              )
              print("[TEST CASE PASSED]: Vulnerability setup is present as credentials can be loaded from file as shown in README.")
              print("[INFO] The google-serviceaccount-creds.json file is loaded and accessible, posing a security risk if exposed.")

          except Exception as e:
              print("[TEST CASE FAILED]: IAPAuth initialization failed, which is unexpected for this test.")
              print(f"Error: {e}")

          # To fully demonstrate the exploit, you would need to:
          # 1. Make google-serviceaccount-creds.json publicly accessible (e.g., commit to public repo).
          # 2. Have an attacker access this file and extract credentials.
          # 3. Use the extracted credentials to access protected resources (requires a real GCP setup).
          # For this test case, we are primarily demonstrating the vulnerability setup from README example.
          ```

    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the Python script: `python test_exploit.py`

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The script should print `[TEST CASE PASSED]: Vulnerability setup is present as credentials can be loaded from file as shown in README.` and `[INFO] The google-serviceaccount-creds.json file is loaded and accessible, posing a security risk if exposed.`
        - This demonstrates that the code is indeed loading credentials from the `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` file as shown in the vulnerable example in `README.md`, highlighting the potential for credential exposure if this file is not properly secured.

    4. **Further Exploitation (Conceptual - requires GCP setup):**
        - To fully demonstrate the impact, an attacker would need to access the publicly exposed `google-serviceaccount-creds.json` (e.g., from a public GitHub repository where a developer mistakenly committed it).
        - The attacker could then use these credentials with the `requests-iap` library or directly with Google Cloud APIs to authenticate as the compromised service account and access protected resources. This part requires a real Google Cloud environment and is beyond the scope of a simple test case to *prove* the vulnerability setup, but it explains the real-world risk.
