- Vulnerability Name: Race Condition in CI Pipeline Verification during Batch Merging

- Description:
    1. Marge-bot initiates a batch merge job for multiple merge requests.
    2. It creates a batch branch and merges all selected merge requests into it.
    3. CI pipeline is triggered for the batch branch.
    4. If the CI pipeline for the batch branch succeeds, marge-bot proceeds to merge individual merge requests one by one into the target branch.
    5. **Vulnerability**: After the batch CI passes and before individual merge requests are merged, changes can be pushed directly to the target branch by other developers, invalidating the CI result for the subsequent individual merges.
    6. Consequently, some merge requests from the batch might be merged even if the target branch has changed in a way that would cause CI failures when these merge requests are applied individually to the updated target branch.
    7. This can lead to a state where the main branch becomes broken even though marge-bot was used.

- Impact:
    - The main branch can become unstable and fail CI checks after merges orchestrated by marge-bot, defeating the purpose of the bot which is to keep the main branch always passing CI.
    - Developers might experience unexpected CI failures on the main branch, leading to disruption and delays.
    - The "Not Rocket Science Rule Of Software Engineering" (always maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests) can be violated.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The description in `README.md` under "Batching Merge Requests" -> "Limitations" acknowledges this issue as a "flaw in this implementation that could potentially result in a non-green master" and describes the scenario. This serves as documentation but not a code-level mitigation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Atomic Merge Operation**: Implement a mechanism to ensure that after the batch CI passes, the individual merges are performed atomically and are not affected by changes to the target branch that occur in between. This could involve locking the target branch or re-verifying the CI status immediately before each individual merge in the batch within a transaction.
    - **Pre-merge target branch SHA check**: Before merging each individual MR from batch, compare current target branch SHA with the SHA that was used for batch CI. If they are different, re-run batch CI or reject the merge.

- Preconditions:
    - Batch merging feature (`--batch`) must be enabled in marge-bot configuration.
    - Multiple merge requests must be ready to be merged simultaneously.
    - Developers must be actively pushing changes directly to the target branch, especially after the batch CI pipeline starts and before individual MRs from the batch are merged.
    - Project setting "Only allow merge requests pipelines to succeed" should be enabled to ensure CI is mandatory.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`marge/batch_job.py:BatchMergeJob.execute()`**: This function orchestrates the batch merging process.
    2. **`marge/batch_job.py:BatchMergeJob.accept_mr()`**: This function merges individual merge requests from the batch.
    3. In `BatchMergeJob.execute()`, after batch CI passes, the code iterates through `working_merge_requests` and calls `accept_mr()` for each.
    4. **Race Condition Window**: Between the batch CI passing in `BatchMergeJob.execute()` and the subsequent calls to `accept_mr()` for each MR, there is a window where the target branch can change.
    5. **`marge/batch_job.py:BatchMergeJob.accept_mr()`**: This function checks if `new_target_sha != expected_remote_target_branch_sha`. However, `expected_remote_target_branch_sha` is captured **before** batch branch creation and CI run in `BatchMergeJob.execute()`.
    6. **Outdated SHA**: Thus, `expected_remote_target_branch_sha` represents the state of the target branch *before* the batch process began, not the potentially modified state *after* batch CI passed and *before* individual MR merge.
    7. **Missing Re-verification**: There's no check within `accept_mr()` or the loop in `execute()` that re-verifies the CI pipeline success against the *current* state of the target branch immediately before merging each individual MR.

    ```python
    # Visualization of Race Condition in BatchMergeJob.execute() and accept_mr()

    # Time -->

    # BatchMergeJob.execute()
    # [ ] Capture remote_target_branch_sha (SHA_T0)
    # [ ] Create batch branch (BA_BRANCH) based on SHA_T0
    # [ ] Merge MRs to BA_BRANCH
    # [ ] Push BA_BRANCH
    # [ ] Create Batch MR (BATCH_MR)
    # [ ] Wait for Batch MR CI to pass (CI_BATCH_PASS)

    # ---- RACE CONDITION WINDOW ---- Target branch can change here ----

    # [Loop for each working_merge_request]
    #   BatchMergeJob.accept_mr(merge_request, remote_target_branch_sha=SHA_T0, ...)  <-- SHA_T0 is outdated!
    #   [ ] Check if current target branch SHA (SHA_CURRENT) != SHA_T0
    #   [ ] Merge individual MR using outdated SHA_T0 context

    # Potential scenario:
    # 1. SHA_T0: Target branch SHA at start of batch job
    # 2. Batch CI passes for BA_BRANCH based on SHA_T0
    # 3. Developer pushes direct commit to target branch, Target branch SHA becomes SHA_T1
    # 4. Marge-bot merges individual MRs from batch, still using SHA_T0 context, even though target is now SHA_T1
    # 5. Main branch might break because individual merges weren't validated against SHA_T1
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Enable batch merging in marge-bot configuration (`--batch`). Ensure "Only allow merge requests pipelines to succeed" is enabled in the GitLab project settings.
    2. **Setup**: Create two merge requests (MR1, MR2) targeting the same branch (e.g., `main`). Both MRs should have passing CI pipelines on their respective branches. Assign both MRs to marge-bot.
    3. **Trigger**: Marge-bot will start processing the merge requests in batch. Observe that a batch merge request is created and CI pipeline starts for it.
    4. **Exploit**: While the batch CI pipeline is running (but before individual MRs from the batch are merged), manually push a commit directly to the target branch (`main`) that introduces a change that would cause CI to fail if MR1 or MR2 were merged on top of it (e.g., break a test that MR1 or MR2 depends on).
    5. **Observe**: Wait for the batch CI pipeline to succeed. Marge-bot will then proceed to merge MR1 and MR2 individually.
    6. **Verify**: Check the target branch (`main`) CI pipeline after marge-bot completes merging MR1 and MR2. The CI pipeline on the main branch should now be failing due to the change introduced in step 4, even though batch CI passed before merging. This demonstrates that MR1 and/or MR2 were merged without proper CI verification against the latest state of the target branch, confirming the race condition vulnerability.
    7. **Expected Result**: CI pipeline on the target branch (`main`) fails after batch merge, even though batch CI passed. This proves the vulnerability.
