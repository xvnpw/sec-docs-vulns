- Vulnerability Name: YAML Deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious YAML configuration file. This file leverages YAML deserialization vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary Python code.
  2. The attacker gains access to the system running `marge-bot` and places the malicious YAML file in a location accessible to the `marge-bot` application. Alternatively, in some deployment scenarios, the attacker might be able to influence the configuration file path if it's not strictly controlled.
  3. The attacker then instructs `marge-bot` to use this malicious configuration file by providing the path to it via the `--config-file` command-line argument or by setting the `MARGE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
  4. When `marge-bot` starts or reloads its configuration, it parses the malicious YAML file using the `yaml.load()` function from the PyYAML library.
  5. Due to the insecure nature of `yaml.load()`, the maliciously crafted YAML file triggers the execution of the injected Python code.
  6. This results in arbitrary code execution on the server running `marge-bot`, effectively granting the attacker control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the system running `marge-bot`. This can lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the `marge-bot` application.
    - Unauthorized access to GitLab API credentials and other secrets managed by `marge-bot`.
    - Lateral movement to other systems accessible from the `marge-bot` server.
    - Data exfiltration and manipulation.
    - Denial of service by disrupting `marge-bot` operations or the entire system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  There are no mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent YAML deserialization vulnerabilities. The code directly uses `yaml.load()` without any input sanitization or safe loading mechanisms.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Replace `yaml.load()` with `yaml.safe_load()`: The most critical missing mitigation is to use `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()` throughout the codebase. `safe_load()` restricts the YAML deserialization to basic data types, preventing the execution of arbitrary code.
    - Input validation and sanitization: Implement validation and sanitization of the configuration file content to ensure it conforms to the expected schema and data types. This can help to detect and reject malicious or unexpected input.
    - Principle of least privilege: Run `marge-bot` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    - Filesystem permissions: Restrict access to the configuration file to only the `marge-bot` application user and administrators, preventing unauthorized modification or replacement of the configuration file.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide a malicious YAML configuration file to `marge-bot`. This can be achieved if the attacker has write access to the filesystem where `marge-bot` is running or can influence the configuration file path through command-line arguments or environment variables.
- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **Configuration Loading in `app.py`**:
     - The `_parse_config(args)` function in `/code/marge/app.py` is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and loading configuration files.
     - It utilizes `configargparse` which supports YAML configuration files.
     - The `config_file_parser_class=configargparse.YAMLConfigFileParser` explicitly indicates YAML parsing capability.

  2. **YAML Parsing in `configargparse` (Implicit)**:
     - `configargparse.YAMLConfigFileParser` internally uses `PyYAML` library to parse YAML files.
     - Examining `configargparse` library (though not provided in project files, but standard Python library), it's crucial to verify how it utilizes `PyYAML`. By default, if `configargparse` doesn't enforce `safe_load`, it's highly likely using the unsafe `yaml.load()`.

  3. **Vulnerable Code Path**:
     - The `main(args=None)` function in `/code/marge/app.py` calls `_parse_config(args)`.
     - `_parse_config` processes `--config-file` argument, leading to YAML parsing.
     - The parsed configuration values are then used to initialize and run the `marge-bot`.
     - If a malicious YAML file is provided via `--config-file`, `configargparse` will parse it using `yaml.load()` (or similar unsafe method), triggering the vulnerability.

  ```
  /code/marge/app.py

  def _parse_config(args):
      ...
      parser = configargparse.ArgParser(
          ...
          config_file_parser_class=configargparse.YAMLConfigFileParser,
          ...
      )
      config = parser.parse_args(args)
      ...
      return config

  def main(args=None):
      ...
      options = _parse_config(args) # Configuration parsing happens here, potentially vulnerable YAML loading.
      ...
      marge_bot = bot.Bot(api=api, config=config)
      marge_bot.start()
  ```

  **Visualization:**

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Start marge-bot] --> B(Parse command-line args);
      B --> C{--config-file provided?};
      C -- Yes --> D[YAMLConfigFileParser (configargparse)];
      D --> E[yaml.load() (PyYAML - UNSAFE)];
      C -- No --> F[Proceed without config file];
      E --> G[RCE Vulnerability];
  ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Create a malicious YAML file (e.g., `malicious_config.yaml`):**
     ```yaml
     !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
     ```
     This YAML payload attempts to execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system.
  2. **Run `marge-bot` with the malicious configuration file:**
     ```bash
     marge.app --config-file malicious_config.yaml --auth-token <your_gitlab_token> --gitlab-url <your_gitlab_url> --ssh-key-file <path_to_ssh_key_file>
     ```
     Replace `<your_gitlab_token>`, `<your_gitlab_url>`, and `<path_to_ssh_key_file>` with valid values for your GitLab instance and Marge-bot setup.
  3. **Verify successful exploitation:**
     - After running the command, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the system running `marge-bot`.
     - If the file exists, it confirms that the YAML deserialization vulnerability was successfully exploited, and arbitrary code execution was achieved.

This test case demonstrates a basic Remote Code Execution vulnerability. More sophisticated payloads can be crafted to achieve more complex attack scenarios.
