### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure SSH Host Key Checking
- Description: Marge-bot disables SSH host key checking by setting `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` in the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`. This setting instructs SSH to automatically accept the host key of the GitLab server on the first connection, without verifying its authenticity against a known list of keys. This bypasses a critical security measure designed to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker who can intercept the initial connection between Marge-bot and the GitLab server could potentially impersonate the GitLab server and gain unauthorized access or control over the git operations performed by Marge-bot.
- Impact:
    - High. An attacker performing a MITM attack during the first connection can impersonate the GitLab server. If successful, the attacker could potentially:
        - Steal the SSH private key used by Marge-bot if it's transmitted during the handshake (less likely in typical SSH key-based auth, but theoretically possible depending on specific SSH configuration and vulnerabilities).
        - Manipulate git operations performed by Marge-bot, potentially leading to:
            - Merging malicious code into the repository.
            - Exfiltration of repository data.
            - Denial of service by disrupting the merge process.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in code. The code explicitly disables host key checking.
    - Documentation mentions using SSH key file and config file for storing SSH key, which is a general security recommendation but does not mitigate this specific vulnerability.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement proper SSH host key verification.
        - Store the GitLab server's host key in a `known_hosts` file.
        - Configure `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` to use the `known_hosts` file and enable `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` or `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`.
        - Provide a mechanism to update the `known_hosts` file if the GitLab server's host key changes.
- Preconditions:
    - Marge-bot is configured to use SSH for git operations (not `--use-https`).
    - Attacker is in a position to perform a MITM attack during the first connection from Marge-bot to the GitLab server. This could be on the network where Marge-bot or GitLab server is hosted, or through DNS poisoning.
    - This vulnerability is most critical on the very first connection to a GitLab server or after removing the known_hosts file entry. Subsequent connections to the same server will not be vulnerable if the attacker cannot perform a persistent MITM.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/marge/git.py`
    - Line: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND = "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no "`
    - This line hardcodes the `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option in the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` variable.
    - When `Repo` class in `/code/marge/git.py` is initialized with SSH key file, this `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is used to construct the environment variable `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` which is passed to `subprocess.Popen` when executing git commands.
    - This effectively disables SSH host key checking for all git commands executed by Marge-bot when using SSH.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Set up a fake GitLab server with a known SSH host key.
        - Configure Marge-bot to connect to this fake GitLab server using SSH.
        - Configure a MITM proxy (e.g., `ssh-mitm`) to intercept the connection between Marge-bot and the fake GitLab server.
        - Configure the MITM proxy to present a different SSH host key to Marge-bot.
    2. Execution:
        - Run Marge-bot.
        - Observe the logs.
    3. Expected result:
        - Marge-bot should connect to the MITM proxy and accept the forged host key without any warning or error because `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` is set.
        - (Ideally, the test could verify that git operations succeed even with the forged key, but just observing successful connection establishment with forged key is sufficient to prove the vulnerability).
    4. Cleanup:
        - Stop Marge-bot and the MITM proxy.
