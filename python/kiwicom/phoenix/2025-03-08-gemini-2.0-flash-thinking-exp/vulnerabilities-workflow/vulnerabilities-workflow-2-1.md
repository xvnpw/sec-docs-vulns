- ### Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Input Validation in Slack Dialog Submission Handlers

- Description:
  1. An attacker interacts with the Phoenix Slack bot using slash commands or interactive components, triggering a dialog submission.
  2. The attacker fills in the dialog form with crafted input in various fields, such as 'summary', 'eta', 'sales affected', 'b2b partners affected', 'lost bookings', 'impact on turnover', 'resolved at', 'started at', 'report URL', etc.
  3. Upon submission, the `handle_interactions` view in `phoenix/slackbot/views.py` processes the payload and routes it to the `DialogSubmissionHandler`.
  4. Within the `DialogSubmissionHandler`, methods like `edit`, `resolve`, `new`, `editsolved`, and `editduration` directly use the user-provided input from `self.dialog_data` to update corresponding fields in Django models (Outage and Solution).
  5. The application lacks comprehensive input validation and sanitization for these dialog submission handlers.
  6. While Django's ORM prevents direct SQL injection, the absence of proper validation can lead to data integrity issues, unexpected application behavior, or potential exploitation of vulnerabilities if model fields or application logic are susceptible to specific input patterns. For example, if certain fields are later processed in a way that assumes specific formats or lengths without prior enforcement, crafted inputs could cause issues.

- Impact:
  - Data Integrity Issues: Maliciously crafted input can lead to incorrect or inconsistent data being stored in the database, affecting the reliability of outage records and reports.
  - Unexpected Application Behavior: Lack of validation may cause unexpected behavior in other parts of the application that rely on the integrity and format of the data entered through Slack dialogs.
  - Potential for Future Exploitation: While not directly exploitable for gaining unauthorized access in the current code, insufficient validation can become a vulnerability if new features or logic are added that rely on the unchecked input, potentially leading to more severe security issues in the future.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Partial input validation exists for 'impact_on_turnover' (integer type check) and 'real_downtime', 'started_at' (date format validation) within `DialogSubmissionHandler`, but it is not comprehensive across all fields and handlers.
  - Django ORM provides protection against SQL injection.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Implement comprehensive input validation for all user-provided fields within `DialogSubmissionHandler` methods (`edit`, `resolve`, `new`, `editsolved`, `editduration`, `assignchannel`, `attachreport`).
  - Validation should include:
    - Type validation (e.g., ensuring integer, date, URL fields are in the correct format).
    - Range validation (e.g., limiting the length of text fields).
    - Sanitization to prevent injection of potentially harmful characters or formats.
    - Consider using Django forms within the dialog handlers to leverage Django's built-in form validation capabilities for processing dialog submissions.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker must be a valid user within the Slack workspace where the Phoenix bot is integrated.
  - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Phoenix bot, either via slash commands (e.g., `/announce`) or interactive components within Slack messages, to trigger dialogs.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/phoenix/slackbot/views.py`
  - Class: `DialogSubmissionHandler`
  - Methods: `edit(self)`, `resolve(self)`, `new(self)`, `editsolved(self)`, `editduration(self)`, `assignchannel(self)`, `attachreport(self)`

  ```python
  class DialogSubmissionHandler:
      # ...
      def edit(self):
          impact_on_turnover = self.dialog_data.get("impact_on_turnover") # Input from dialog
          if impact_on_turnover:
              try:
                  int(impact_on_turnover) # Partial validation: type check for integer
              except ValueError:
                  self.errors.append(...)

          outage = Outage.objects.get(id=self.obj)
          outage.summary = self.dialog_data.get("summary") # Direct update with dialog input - POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY
          outage.set_eta(self.dialog_data.get("eta")) # Direct update with dialog input - POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY
          # ... and other fields are updated similarly without comprehensive validation

      def resolve(self):
          # ...
          try:
              resolved_at = arrow.get( # Date parsing with timezone
                  self.dialog_data.get("real_downtime"), "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm" # Input from dialog
              )
              resolved_at = resolved_at_to_utc(resolved_at, user_tz)
          except (ValueError, arrow.parser.ParserError):
              self.errors.append({"name": "real_downtime", "error": "Invalid format."}) # Partial validation: date format check

          impact_on_turnover = self.dialog_data.get("impact_on_turnover") # Input from dialog
          if impact_on_turnover:
              try:
                  int(impact_on_turnover) # Partial validation: type check for integer
              except ValueError:
                  self.errors.append(...)

          solution = outage.solution
          solution.resolved_at = resolved_at # Direct update with parsed input
          solution.summary = self.dialog_data.get("summary") # Direct update with dialog input - POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY
          # ... and other fields are updated similarly without comprehensive validation
      # ... other methods in DialogSubmissionHandler follow similar pattern

- Security Test Case:
  1. Log in to Slack as a valid user in the workspace where Phoenix bot is installed.
  2. Trigger the `/announce` slash command to initiate a new outage announcement dialog.
  3. In the "What happened?" field (summary), enter a long string exceeding expected limits, or input containing special characters or control characters that might cause unexpected behavior.
  4. Fill other required fields with valid data and submit the dialog.
  5. Access the Phoenix web application (e.g., `localhost:8000`) and navigate to the list of outages or the detail page of the newly created outage.
  6. Observe how the "summary" and other fields are displayed. Check for any data truncation, encoding issues, or unexpected characters.
  7. Repeat steps 2-6 for other dialogs, such as "Edit Outage" or "Resolve Outage", and try to inject potentially problematic input into different fields like "ETA", "Sales affected details", "Lost bookings details", "Impact on turnover", "Report URL", etc.
  8. Examine the database directly to confirm if the input data was stored as expected or if any data corruption or unexpected changes occurred due to the crafted input.
  9. Monitor the application logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues caused by the crafted input.
  10. Attempt to input values of incorrect types (e.g. text in a number field) and check if the application handles the error gracefully or if it leads to unexpected behavior.
