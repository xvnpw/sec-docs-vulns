- Vulnerability Name: Lack of Input Validation in Outage Summary leading to Markdown Injection in Slack Announcements
  - Description:
    1. A user with "Can add announcement" permission uses the `/announce` Slack slash command.
    2. In the dialog, the user enters a malicious payload in the "What happened?" field (summary). For example, they include Slack Markdown formatting like `*bold text*`, `_italic text_`, or more potentially harmful elements like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` (although Slack might sanitize `<script>`, other markdown injections can still be harmful).
    3. The Phoenix application processes this input without proper sanitization and creates an outage announcement.
    4. The Slack announcement message is generated using the unsanitized summary and posted to the designated Slack channel.
    5. Any user viewing the announcement in Slack will see the injected Markdown formatting, potentially leading to visually misleading or confusing announcements. While full XSS is unlikely due to Slack's sanitization, other markdown injections could be used for phishing or social engineering.
  - Impact:
    - Modified Slack announcement appearance: Attackers can alter the intended formatting of outage announcements, making them unclear, unprofessional, or even misleading.
    - Potential for social engineering or phishing: While not full XSS, malicious Markdown could be crafted to subtly mislead users or create confusion, potentially as a precursor to social engineering attacks.
    - Reduced trust in announcements: Inconsistent or manipulated formatting can erode trust in the reliability and accuracy of outage announcements.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code related to summary input handling in `phoenix/slackbot/views.py` or `phoenix/slackbot/message.py`. The code directly uses the input summary to generate Slack messages.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for the outage summary field in the Slack dialog submission handler (`handle_dialog_submission` in `phoenix/slackbot/views.py`).
    - Implement Markdown sanitization or stripping of Markdown formatting from the summary before including it in Slack messages in `phoenix/slackbot/message.py`.
  - Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to have a Slack account within the workspace where the Phoenix application is installed.
    - The attacker needs to be granted the "Can add announcement" permission in Phoenix.
    - The Slack slash command `/announce` must be configured and accessible.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/phoenix/slackbot/views.py**
    2. The `announce` function handles the `/announce` slash command and opens a Slack dialog.
    3. The `handle_interactions` function processes Slack interactions, including dialog submissions. It calls `handle_dialog_submission`.
    4. The `DialogSubmissionHandler` class in `handle_dialog_submission` processes the dialog submission.
    5. In `DialogSubmissionHandler.new()` and `DialogSubmissionHandler.edit()`, the `summary` is retrieved from `self.dialog_data.get("summary")` and directly assigned to `outage.summary` without any sanitization.

    ```python
    # File: /code/phoenix/slackbot/views.py
    class DialogSubmissionHandler:
        # ...
        def new(self):
            # ...
            outage = Outage(
                summary=self.dialog_data.get("summary"), # Unsanitized input
                # ...
            )
            # ...

        def edit(self):
            # ...
            outage = Outage.objects.get(id=self.obj)
            outage.summary = self.dialog_data.get("summary") # Unsanitized input
            # ...
    ```

    6. **File: /code/phoenix/slackbot/message.py**
    7. The `generate_slack_message` function and the `BaseMessage` class are responsible for generating the Slack message attachments.
    8. In `BaseMessage.__init__`, `self.outage.summary` is directly used to set `attachment["text"]`.

    ```python
    # File: /code/phoenix/slackbot/message.py
    class BaseMessage:
        def __init__(self, outage, announcement):
            # ...
            attachment = {
                # ...
                "text": self.outage.summary, # Unsanitized summary from database
                # ...
            }
            # ...
    ```

    9. The `outage.summary` in the database is directly populated from the unsanitized user input from the Slack dialog.
    10. Therefore, any Markdown injected in the summary during the dialog submission will be directly rendered in the Slack announcement.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. As an attacker with "Can add announcement" permission, initiate the `/announce` Slack command.
    2. In the "What happened?" dialog field, enter the following payload: `*Test Announcement in Bold* _Italic Announcement_ <https://example.com|Phishing Link>`.
    3. Fill in other required fields and submit the dialog.
    4. Observe the outage announcement posted in the designated Slack channel.
    5. Verify that the announcement summary renders the Markdown formatting: "Test Announcement in Bold" is bold, "Italic Announcement" is italic, and "Phishing Link" is a clickable link with the text "Phishing Link" pointing to `https://example.com`.
    6. This confirms that Markdown injection is possible via the outage summary field.
