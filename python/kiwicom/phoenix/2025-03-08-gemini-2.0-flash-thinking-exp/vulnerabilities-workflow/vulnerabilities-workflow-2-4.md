- Vulnerability Name: Unprotected Status and Health Check Endpoints
- Description:
    - The application exposes `/slack/status` and `/slack/health` endpoints that provide internal application status information without any authentication or authorization checks.
    - An attacker can access these endpoints without any credentials.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker sends a GET request to `/slack/status` or `/slack/slack/health` endpoints of the Phoenix application.
        2. The application responds with a JSON payload containing the status of the application and its dependencies (database, Slack API, Celery).
- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure (Low):** An attacker can gain insights into the internal workings and health of the Phoenix application and its dependencies. This information can be used to identify potential weaknesses or plan further attacks. While not directly leading to data breach or system compromise, it lowers the security posture by revealing internal status.
- Vulnerability Rank: Low
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement authentication and authorization for the `/slack/status` and `/slack/health` endpoints.
    - Restrict access to these endpoints to authorized users or internal networks only.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have network access to the Phoenix application.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/phoenix/slackbot/views.py`
    - ```python
      @api_view(["POST"])
      def handle_status(request):
          return JsonResponse({"status": "ok"}, status=200)


      def handle_up(request):
          """Check status of required services."""
          db_conn = connections["default"]
          try:
              db_conn.cursor()
          except OperationalError:
              logger.error("Database connection check failed")
              return JsonResponse({"status": "error"}, status=500)

          data = slack_client.api_call("api.test")
          bot_data = slack_bot_client.api_call("api.test")
          if not data["ok"] or not bot_data["ok"]:
              logger.error("Slack API connection check failed")
              return JsonResponse({"status": "error"}, status=500)

          try:
              test_task.delay()
          except kombu.exceptions.OperationalError:
              logger.error("Celery tasks check failed")
              return JsonResponse({"status": "error"}, status=500)

          return JsonResponse({"status": "ok"}, status=200)

      @api_view(["GET", "POST"])
      @verify_token
      def announce(request):
      ```
      - The `handle_status` and `handle_up` functions are exposed as API views via URLs defined in `/code/phoenix/slackbot/urls.py`:
      - ```python
        urlpatterns = [
            ...
            url(r"^status$", handle_status),
            url(r"^health$", handle_status), # Note: health also maps to handle_status, likely a typo, should be handle_up?
            url(r"^up$", handle_up),
            ...
        ]
      ```
      - As seen in the code, `handle_status` and `handle_up` are directly accessible without any decorators that would enforce authentication or authorization. `handle_status` is even marked as `@api_view(["POST"])` which is incorrect as it responds to GET requests as well.  The `verify_token` decorator is only used on the `announce` endpoint, not on the status or health check endpoints.
- Security Test Case:
    - Step-by-step test:
        1. Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl`.
        2. Send a GET request to `http://<phoenix_url>/slack/status` and `http://<phoenix_url>/slack/up` (or `/slack/health`).
        3. Observe the response. It should be a JSON response with status information, indicating the vulnerability is present.
        4. Example using curl:
           ```bash
           curl http://<phoenix_url>/slack/status
           curl http://<phoenix_url>/slack/up
           ```
        5. Expected output for `/slack/status`: `{"status": "ok"}`
        6. Expected output for `/slack/up`: `{"status": "ok"}` (if all dependencies are healthy) or `{"status": "error"}` (if any dependency is unhealthy).
        7. This test proves that these endpoints are accessible to anyone without authentication.
