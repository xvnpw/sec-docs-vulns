### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Log Injection in Sentry messages, contexts and tags

*   **Description:**
    1.  An application uses `structlog` for logging and `structlog-sentry` to integrate logs with Sentry.
    2.  User-controlled input is included in log messages or context data when using `structlog` logging methods (e.g., `log.info("User input: %s", user_input)` or `log.error("Error", user_id=user_input)`).
    3.  `structlog-sentry`'s `SentryProcessor` captures these log events and sends them to Sentry.
    4.  The `SentryProcessor` directly extracts the log message (`event`) and context data (the entire `event_dict` or specific keys as tags) from the `structlog` event without any sanitization or encoding.
    5.  An attacker can manipulate user-controlled input to inject malicious content into the log messages, context data, or tags that are sent to Sentry. This injected content could be plain text or formatted text (e.g., using markdown if Sentry supports it in descriptions or tags).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misleading Sentry data:** Attackers can inject false or misleading information into Sentry, making it harder to diagnose real issues and potentially leading to incorrect incident response.
    *   **Security alert fatigue:** Injection of irrelevant or crafted messages can cause an increase in alerts, leading to alert fatigue for security personnel, and potentially causing them to overlook genuine security incidents.
    *   **Obfuscation of real issues:** Malicious log entries can bury legitimate errors and warnings, hindering the ability to identify and resolve critical problems.
    *   **Potential for exploitation of Sentry features:** Depending on how Sentry processes and displays log data, injected content could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in Sentry's UI or data processing if it attempts to render or interpret the injected content (e.g., if Sentry UI improperly handles markdown or HTML in event descriptions or tags).

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The `SentryProcessor` in `structlog-sentry` directly forwards the log event data to Sentry without any sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement sanitization or encoding of log messages, context data, and tag values within the `SentryProcessor` before sending them to Sentry. This could involve:
        *   Escaping special characters that might have semantic meaning in Sentry or in systems that consume Sentry data.
        *   Truncating excessively long input strings to prevent potential buffer overflows or display issues in Sentry.
        *   Using a templating engine with auto-escaping for log messages if formatting is required, instead of direct string concatenation of user input.
    *   **Documentation:** Add documentation to the `README.md` file warning users about the risks of including unsanitized user input in logs when using `structlog-sentry`, and recommend sanitization practices.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The application must be using `structlog` for logging.
    *   `structlog-sentry` library with `SentryProcessor` must be used to send logs to Sentry.
    *   The application must log user-controlled input, either directly in the log message or as part of the context data (event dictionary).
    *   The `SentryProcessor` should be configured to send log events as events or breadcrumbs to Sentry (which is the default behavior for error and higher level logs). If tags are configured, and user input can influence tag values, it is also a precondition.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   **File: `/code/structlog_sentry/__init__.py`**
    *   **`SentryProcessor.__call__(self, logger: WrappedLogger, name: str, event_dict: EventDict) -> EventDict`**: This is the main processing method called by `structlog` for each log event.
        ```python
        def __call__(
            self, logger: WrappedLogger, name: str, event_dict: EventDict
        ) -> EventDict:
            """A middleware to process structlog `event_dict` and send it to Sentry."""
            self._original_event_dict = dict(event_dict) # [1] Copies the event_dict
            sentry_skip = event_dict.pop("sentry_skip", False)

            if self.active and not sentry_skip and self._can_record(logger, event_dict):
                level = self._get_level_value(event_dict["level"].upper())

                if level >= self.event_level:
                    self._handle_event(event_dict) # [2] Handles event sending

                if level >= self.level:
                    self._handle_breadcrumb(event_dict) # [3] Handles breadcrumb sending

            if self.verbose:
                event_dict.setdefault("sentry", "skipped")

            return event_dict
        ```
        [1]: The `event_dict` which can contain user-controlled input is copied to `self._original_event_dict`.
        [2] and [3]:  `_handle_event` and `_handle_breadcrumb` methods are called to process and send data to Sentry.

    *   **`SentryProcessor._get_event_and_hint(self, event_dict: EventDict) -> tuple[dict, dict]`**: This method prepares the Sentry event.
        ```python
        def _get_event_and_hint(self, event_dict: EventDict) -> tuple[dict, dict]:
            # ... (Exception handling logic omitted for brevity) ...

            event["message"] = event_dict.get("event") # [4] Message from event_dict
            event["level"] = event_dict.get("level")
            if "logger" in event_dict:
                event["logger"] = event_dict["logger"]

            if self._as_context:
                event["contexts"] = {"structlog": self._original_event_dict.copy()} # [5] Context from original event_dict
            if self.tag_keys == "__all__":
                event["tags"] = self._original_event_dict.copy() # [6] All tags from original event_dict
            if isinstance(self.tag_keys, list):
                event["tags"] = {
                    key: event_dict[key] for key in self.tag_keys if key in event_dict # [7] Specific tags from event_dict
                }

            return event, hint
        ```
        [4]: The `event['message']` is directly taken from `event_dict.get('event')`. If the 'event' value in `event_dict` contains user input, it's directly used as the Sentry event message without sanitization.
        [5]: If `as_context=True` (default), the entire `self._original_event_dict` (which is a copy of the log event data including potentially user-controlled input) is added as context to the Sentry event under the key "structlog".
        [6]: If `tag_keys="__all__"`, the entire `self._original_event_dict` is used to create tags for the Sentry event.
        [7]: If `tag_keys` is a list of keys, the values corresponding to these keys are extracted from the `event_dict` and used as tags. If these keys or their values originate from user input, they are used as tags without sanitization.

    *   **`SentryProcessor._get_breadcrumb_and_hint(self, event_dict: EventDict) -> tuple[dict, dict]`**: This method prepares Sentry breadcrumbs.
        ```python
        def _get_breadcrumb_and_hint(self, event_dict: EventDict) -> tuple[dict, dict]:
            data = {
                k: v for k, v in event_dict.items() if k not in self.ignore_breadcrumb_data # [8] Breadcrumb data from event_dict
            }
            event = {
                "type": "log",
                "level": event_dict.get("level"),  # type: ignore
                "category": event_dict.get("logger"),
                "message": event_dict["event"], # [9] Breadcrumb message from event_dict
                "timestamp": event_dict.get("timestamp"),
                "data": data, # [10] Breadcrumb data
            }

            return event, {"log_record": event_dict}
        ```
        [8]: The `data` for breadcrumbs is created by filtering out keys specified in `ignore_breadcrumb_data` from the `event_dict`.  All remaining key-value pairs from `event_dict`, which can include user input, are included in the breadcrumb data.
        [9]: The `event['message']` for breadcrumbs is taken directly from `event_dict['event']`, similar to event messages.
        [10]: The `data` dictionary, derived from the `event_dict`, is included in the breadcrumb.

    In summary, the code directly uses data from the `event_dict` (which can contain user-controlled input) to populate Sentry messages, context, tags, and breadcrumbs without any sanitization. This confirms the log injection vulnerability.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Install `structlog-sentry` and `sentry-sdk`.
        *   Initialize Sentry SDK with a test DSN or a mock transport to capture events locally.
        *   Configure `structlog` to use `structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter.wrap_for_formatter` and include `structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name`, `structlog.stdlib.add_log_level`, and `SentryProcessor` in the processors list.
        *   Get a logger instance using `structlog.get_logger()`.
    2.  **Execute:**
        *   Define a malicious user input string, for example: `malicious_input = "User <script>alert('XSS')</script> input with **markdown** and newline\nSecond line"`.
        *   Log an error message using `structlog` and include the `malicious_input` in the log event:
            ```python
            log.error("Error with user input", user_input=malicious_input)
            ```
    3.  **Verify:**
        *   Check the captured Sentry event (either in the mock transport's events or in the Sentry UI if using a real DSN).
        *   Verify that the Sentry event's message or context data (depending on `SentryProcessor` configuration) contains the `malicious_input` string exactly as it was logged, including the HTML tags, markdown syntax, and newline character.
        *   Specifically, check:
            *   The event message in Sentry contains `User <script>alert('XSS')</script> input with **markdown** and newline\nSecond line`.
            *   If `as_context=True` (default), the Sentry event context under `contexts.structlog` contains the `user_input` key with the malicious string as its value.
            *   If `tag_keys` is configured to include keys that might contain user input or if `tag_keys="__all__"`, check that the Sentry event tags also contain the malicious string.

    This test case demonstrates that unsanitized user input logged using `structlog` is directly passed to Sentry by `structlog-sentry`, confirming the log injection vulnerability in messages, contexts and tags.
