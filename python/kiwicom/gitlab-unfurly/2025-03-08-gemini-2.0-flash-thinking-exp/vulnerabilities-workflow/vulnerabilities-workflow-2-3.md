### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Misinterpretation of GitLab Project Path with Extra Segments

- **Description:**
    The `parse_path` function in `unfurl_message.py` uses regular expressions to parse GitLab URLs. The regex for issue, merge request, commit, pipeline, and job URLs can potentially misinterpret URLs with extra path segments between the project name and the resource type (e.g., `/issues`, `/merge_requests`). Specifically, the regex `r"^\/(?P<team>[\w-]+)\/(?P<subgroups>[\w/-]*?)\/?(?P<project>[\w-]+)\/-?\/?(?P<type>issues|merge_requests|commit|pipelines|jobs)\/(?P<identifier>\w+)\/?$"` allows for an optional path segment due to `\/?` before `/-?\/?`. This could lead to the bot making API requests to GitLab for a different project than intended if a crafted URL with extra segments is provided.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An attacker crafts a GitLab URL that includes an extra path segment after the project name but before the resource type identifier (e.g., `/issues/123`).
    2. The attacker sends this crafted URL in a Slack message to a channel where the GitLab Unfurly bot is active.
    3. The Slack bot's `unfurl` function receives the message and extracts the URL.
    4. The `parse_path` function attempts to parse the URL using the vulnerable regex.
    5. Due to the optional path segment `\/?` in the regex, the URL might be incorrectly parsed, potentially leading to a misinterpretation of the intended GitLab project.
    6. The bot then uses the potentially misparsed project information to construct GitLab API requests.
    7. If the misparsing leads to querying a different GitLab project (especially one that the attacker has access to), the bot might unfurl information from that unintended project in Slack.

- **Impact:**
    Information Disclosure. If an attacker can craft a GitLab URL with extra path segments that is still parsed by the bot but leads to a different GitLab project being queried, they might be able to trick the bot into unfurling information from a project they have access to. This could potentially disclose sensitive information if the attacker can manipulate the path to point to a public or accessible project, and the bot retrieves and displays information thinking it's related to a different (potentially private or less accessible) project.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None in the URL parsing logic itself. The bot relies on GitLab's access control mechanisms to limit information access after a successful API call. However, the vulnerability lies in potentially making API calls in the wrong project context due to misparsing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    1. **Strict URL Path Validation:** Modify the regular expression in the `parse_path` function to strictly enforce the expected URL structure. The regex should be more precise and not allow optional path segments in unexpected places, specifically between the project name and the resource type identifier.
    2. **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement input validation in the `parse_path` function to explicitly reject URLs that do not conform to the expected GitLab URL structure, instead of trying to loosely parse them.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. A publicly accessible instance of the GitLab Unfurly bot is deployed and connected to a Slack workspace.
    2. The attacker has access to a GitLab instance connected to the bot.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`parse_path` function in `/code/unfurl_message.py`:**
        ```python
        def parse_path(path, fragment=None):
            # issue, merge request or commit path
            pattern = r"^\/(?P<team>[\w-]+)\/(?P<subgroups>[\w/-]*?)\/?(?P<project>[\w-]+)\/-?\/?(?P<type>issues|merge_requests|commit|pipelines|jobs)\/(?P<identifier>\w+)\/?$"
            m = re.match(pattern, path)
            if m:
                path_type = m.group("type")
                note = None
                if fragment:
                    path_type = f"note_{path_type}"
                    note = fragment.split("_")[1]

                path_type = PathType(path_type)
                return PathInfo(
                    type=path_type,
                    team=m.group("team"),
                    project=m.group("project"),
                    identifier=m.group("identifier"),
                    subgroups=m.group("subgroups") or None,
                    note=note,
                )
        ```
        **Vulnerability:** The regex `r"^\/(?P<team>[\w-]+)\/(?P<subgroups>[\w/-]*?)\/?(?P<project>[\w-]+)\/-?\/?(?P<type>issues|merge_requests|commit|pipelines|jobs)\/(?P<identifier>\w+)\/?$"` uses `\/?` before `/-?\/?`, which makes the path segment between the project and resource type optional. This optional segment allows for URLs with extra path components to be parsed, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the intended GitLab project context.

    2. **`unfurl` function in `/code/unfurl_message.py`:**
        ```python
        def unfurl(event, context):
            # ...
            for link in request_json["event"]["links"]:
                raw_url = link["url"]
                url = urlparse(raw_url.replace("\\", ""))
                log.bind(url=url)
                if "no_unfurl" in url.query:
                    log.info("Skipping URL as requested")
                    continue

                try:
                    path_info = parse_path(url.path, url.fragment)
                except ValueError as exc:
                    log.error("Can't parse path")
                    continue

                try:
                    handler = get_handler(path_info)
                except ValueError as exc:
                    log.error("Can't get handler", error_message=exc)
                    continue
                attachment = handler(session, path_info)

                attachment["title_link"] = raw_url
                r = slack.api_call(
                    "chat.unfurl",
                    channel=request_json["event"]["channel"],
                    ts=request_json["event"]["message_ts"],
                    unfurls={raw_url: attachment},
                )
                log.info("Slack API call", response=r)
            # ...
        ```
        The `unfurl` function calls `parse_path` to process URLs. If `parse_path` misparses a URL, the subsequent steps including fetching data from GitLab API and unfurling in Slack will be based on the incorrect parsing result.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Deploy a GitLab Unfurly bot instance and connect it to a test Slack workspace. Configure it to access a test GitLab instance.
        b. Create two projects in the test GitLab instance:
            i. `public-project` (Publicly accessible). Create an issue, e.g., "Public Issue #1" in this project.
            ii. `private-project` (Private, not accessible to the attacker without specific permissions). Create an issue, e.g., "Private Issue #1" in this project.
    2. **Crafted URL:** Construct a URL with an extra path segment between the project name and `/issues`. For example: `https://<your-gitlab-url>/<team-namespace>/private-project/extra-segment/issues/1`
    3. **Send to Slack:** Send the crafted URL in a Slack message to the test Slack workspace.
    4. **Observe Slack Unfurl:** Examine the unfurled message in the Slack channel.
    5. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** If the bot is vulnerable, it might misparse the URL. While it's possible the API call might fail due to the unexpected path segment, the vulnerability lies in the parsing logic being too lenient. In a successful exploit scenario (depending on GitLab API behavior and project naming), the bot might unexpectedly unfurl information. For instance, if due to misparsing, the bot queries `public-project` instead of `private-project` and finds an issue `1` there, it could unfurl "Public Issue #1" in response to the crafted URL intended for `private-project`. Even if no information is unfurled, the fact that the bot does not reject the malformed URL indicates a parsing vulnerability.
