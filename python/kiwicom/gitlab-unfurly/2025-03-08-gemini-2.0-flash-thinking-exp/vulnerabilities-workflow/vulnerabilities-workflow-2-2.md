- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential lack of sanitization in GitLab content leading to XSS in Slack

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker injects a malicious payload, such as an XSS payload, into a GitLab issue title, description, merge request title, description, commit message, project description or note.
    2. A user shares a link to this GitLab resource in a Slack channel where the GitLab Unfurly bot is active.
    3. The Slack bot detects the GitLab URL and fetches data from GitLab API to create a rich preview (unfurl).
    4. The bot includes the potentially malicious content from GitLab (e.g., issue title, description) in the Slack unfurl message.
    5. If the sanitization of this content is insufficient, the malicious payload is rendered by the Slack client when users view the unfurl, potentially leading to cross-site scripting within the Slack client.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the Slack client of users viewing the unfurled GitLab links.
    - An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's Slack client, potentially leading to session hijacking, sensitive information disclosure, or other malicious actions within the Slack workspace.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project implements a sanitization function `strip_html_tags` in `/code/unfurl_message.py`.
    - This function utilizes the `bleach.clean` library with `tags=[]` and `strip=True`. This configuration is intended to remove all HTML tags from the input string.
    - The `strip_html_tags` function is used within the `prepare_description` function, which is then applied to various text fields retrieved from GitLab API responses, such as issue descriptions, merge request descriptions, and project descriptions before they are included in the Slack unfurl.
    - Example of usage in `get_issue_info` function in `/code/unfurl_message.py`:
    ```python
    def get_issue_info(session, path_info):
        # ...
        description = data["description"] or ""
        # ...
        return {
            # ...
            "text": prepare_description(description, width=300),
            # ...
        }
    ```
    - Example of `strip_html_tags` function in `/code/unfurl_message.py`:
    ```python
    def strip_html_tags(value):
        return bleach.clean(value, tags=[], strip=True)
    ```

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - While HTML tag stripping is implemented using `bleach`, a more comprehensive review of sanitization might be beneficial to ensure that all potential XSS vectors are addressed, including edge cases or potential bypasses in the `bleach` library or other encoding issues.
    - Context-aware output encoding is not explicitly visible in the provided code. While `bleach` is used for HTML stripping, it's important to ensure that the output is also properly encoded for the Slack message format to prevent any unintended execution of scripts or interpretation of special characters. However, given the usage of `slackclient` library, it is expected to handle proper encoding for Slack API calls.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker needs to have access to a GitLab instance where they can create or modify issues, merge requests, commit messages, project descriptions or notes.
    2. The GitLab Unfurly bot must be deployed and configured to unfurl URLs from the attacker's GitLab instance in a Slack workspace.
    3. A Slack user must share a link to the GitLab resource containing the malicious payload in a Slack channel where the bot is active.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `unfurl` function in `/code/unfurl_message.py` is the main handler for processing Slack events and unfurling GitLab URLs.
    2. When a Slack message containing a GitLab URL is received, the `unfurl` function parses the URL using `urlparse` and `parse_path`.
    3. Based on the parsed path, it determines the type of GitLab resource (issue, merge request, commit, etc.) and calls the corresponding handler function (e.g., `get_issues_info`, `get_merge_requests_info`, `get_commit_info`, `get_project_info`, `get_note_issues_info`, `get_note_merge_requests_info`).
    4. These handler functions fetch data from the GitLab API using `requests` and the `GITLAB_TOKEN`.
    5. The fetched data, which may include user-generated content like issue titles and descriptions, is then used to construct a Slack attachment.
    6. The `prepare_description` function is used to sanitize descriptions before including them in the Slack attachment. This function calls `strip_html_tags` which uses `bleach.clean(tags=[], strip=True)` to remove HTML tags.
    7. The Slack attachment, including the sanitized description, is then sent to the Slack API using `slack.api_call("chat.unfurl", ...)`.
    8. The sanitization logic relies on `bleach.clean(tags=[], strip=True)` to prevent XSS by removing HTML tags. This approach is likely to mitigate common HTML-based XSS attacks by stripping out tags.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Deploy the GitLab Unfurly bot to AWS and configure it to connect to a test GitLab instance and a test Slack workspace, following the instructions in `/code/README.md`.
        - Create a test project in the GitLab instance.
        - Install the GitLab Unfurly Slack app in the test Slack workspace.
    2. **Steps:**
        - In the test GitLab project, create a new issue.
        - In the "Title" field of the issue, enter the following XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Title_Test')>Test Issue Title`.
        - In the "Description" field of the issue, enter the following XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_Description_Test')>Test Issue Description`.
        - Save the issue.
        - Copy the URL of the newly created issue.
        - In the test Slack workspace, in a channel where the GitLab Unfurly bot is active, paste the copied GitLab issue URL and send the message.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The GitLab Unfurly bot should unfurl the URL in Slack, displaying a rich preview of the GitLab issue.
        - **Crucially, the JavaScript alerts `alert('XSS_Title_Test')` and `alert('XSS_Description_Test')` should NOT be triggered.** This is because the `strip_html_tags` function should remove the `<img>` tags and their `onerror` attributes, preventing the XSS payload from being executed.
        - The title and description in the Slack unfurl should be rendered without HTML tags, effectively displaying "Test Issue Title" and "Test Issue Description".

    If the alerts are triggered, it would indicate a failure in the sanitization and a valid XSS vulnerability. Based on the code analysis and the use of `bleach` with strict settings, the alerts are not expected to trigger, suggesting that basic HTML XSS via tag injection is mitigated. However, further testing with more complex XSS payloads and different contexts might be needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
