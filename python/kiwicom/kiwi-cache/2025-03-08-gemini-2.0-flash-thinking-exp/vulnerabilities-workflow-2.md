- Potential Path Traversal in User-Implemented `load_from_source`

    #### Vulnerability Name
    Potential Path Traversal in User-Implemented `load_from_source`

    #### Description
    If a user implements the `load_from_source` method in a subclass of `KiwiCache` and uses user-controlled cache keys to construct file paths without proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially craft malicious cache keys to access files outside the intended cache scope.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An application developer creates a subclass of `KiwiCache` (or `AioKiwiCache`) and implements the `load_from_source` method.
    2. Within the `load_from_source` method, the developer uses the cache key (which can be influenced by user input) to construct a file path for reading data.
    3. The developer fails to sanitize or validate the cache key to prevent path traversal attempts.
    4. An attacker crafts a malicious cache key containing path traversal sequences like `../` (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`).
    5. The attacker triggers the application to request data from the cache using the malicious key.
    6. The `load_from_source` method, upon receiving the malicious key, constructs a file path based on this unsanitized input.
    7. Due to the path traversal sequences, the constructed file path resolves to a location outside the intended cache directory, potentially accessing sensitive files.
    8. The `load_from_source` method reads the content of the file at the traversed path and returns it as cache data.
    9. The attacker receives the content of the sensitive file, which was unintentionally exposed due to the path traversal vulnerability.

    #### Impact
    Unauthorized file access. An attacker can read sensitive files on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure, exposure of credentials, or further system compromise. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the files accessible through path traversal.

    #### Vulnerability Rank
    High

    #### Currently Implemented Mitigations
    None. The `kiwi-cache` library itself does not provide any built-in mitigations against path traversal vulnerabilities in user-implemented `load_from_source` methods. The security relies entirely on the user's secure implementation of this method.

    #### Missing Mitigations
    - **Documentation and Warnings:** The library documentation should prominently highlight the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if user-provided cache keys are used to construct file paths in the `load_from_source` method. It should strongly recommend sanitizing and validating cache keys to prevent path traversal attacks.
    - **Code Examples and Best Practices:** The documentation could include code examples demonstrating how to safely handle file paths and sanitize user inputs within the `load_from_source` method. This could include using functions like `os.path.basename` to extract safe filenames or validating the cache key against a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns.

    #### Preconditions
    1. The application must use the `kiwi-cache` library and implement a subclass of `KiwiCache` (or `AioKiwiCache`).
    2. The subclass must implement the `load_from_source` method to read data from files based on cache keys.
    3. The `load_from_source` method must construct file paths using user-controlled cache keys without proper sanitization.
    4. An attacker must be able to influence or control the cache keys used to access the cache.

    #### Source Code Analysis
    1. **`kw.cache.base.KiwiCache` and `kw.cache.aio.AioKiwiCache` classes:** These are base classes that define the caching mechanism. They require users to implement the `load_from_source` method.
    2. **`load_from_source` method (not implemented in `kiwi-cache`):** This method is intended to be implemented by users in their subclasses. The `kiwi-cache` library does not dictate how this method should be implemented, giving flexibility to users but also introducing potential security risks if implemented insecurely.
    3. **User-controlled cache keys:** The cache is accessed using keys, e.g., `cache['user_provided_key']`. If these keys are directly used to construct file paths in `load_from_source` without sanitization, a path traversal vulnerability can occur.

    **Example of Vulnerable `load_from_source` Implementation (Conceptual):**

    ```python
    import os
    import redis
    from kw.cache import KiwiCache

    class VulnerableFileCache(KiwiCache):
        def load_from_source(self):
            base_dir = '/var/app/cache_files/'
            filename = self._key_suffix  # Assuming _key_suffix is derived from the cache key
            filepath = os.path.join(base_dir, filename) # Vulnerable path construction
            try:
                with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                return {'file_content': content}
            except IOError:
                return {}

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        cache = VulnerableFileCache(resources_redis=redis_client)
        # Attacker provides a malicious key: '../../../etc/passwd'
        malicious_key = '../../../etc/passwd'
        try:
            file_data = cache[malicious_key]
            print(f"File content: {file_data}") # In vulnerable case, prints content of /etc/passwd
        except KeyError:
            print(f"Key '{malicious_key}' not found in cache or source.")
    ```

    In this example, if an attacker provides a cache key like `'../../../etc/passwd'`, the `load_from_source` method will construct the path `/var/app/cache_files/../../../etc/passwd`, which simplifies to `/etc/passwd`, leading to unauthorized access.

    #### Security Test Case
    **Step-by-step test:**
    1. **Setup Vulnerable Application:** Create a Python application that uses the `kiwi-cache` library and includes the `VulnerableFileCache` class as described in the Source Code Analysis example. Ensure that the `base_dir` in `VulnerableFileCache` is set to a suitable directory for testing (e.g., a temporary directory). Create a test file (e.g., `test_sensitive_file.txt`) within a directory that should be inaccessible via path traversal, and place a copy of it inside the `base_dir` under the name `safe_file.txt`.
    2. **Install Dependencies:** Install `kiwi-cache` and `redis-py`.
    3. **Run Redis Server:** Ensure a Redis server is running and accessible to the application.
    4. **Execute Vulnerable Code:** Run the Python application.
    5. **Craft Malicious Key:** Prepare a malicious cache key designed to traverse directories and access the `test_sensitive_file.txt` located outside the intended `base_dir`. For example, if `base_dir` is `/tmp/cache/`, and `test_sensitive_file.txt` is in `/tmp/`, a malicious key could be `'../../test_sensitive_file.txt'`.
    6. **Access Cache with Malicious Key:** Send a request to the application to access the cache using the malicious key. This will typically involve calling `cache[malicious_key]`.
    7. **Verify File Access:** Check the output of the application. If the path traversal is successful, the application will read and output the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt` (or attempt to, depending on file permissions). If the vulnerability is not present or mitigated, the application should either raise a `KeyError` (if the file isn't intended to be accessed) or access only the `safe_file.txt` within the intended `base_dir`.
    8. **Expected Result (Vulnerable Case):** The application outputs the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt`, demonstrating that the attacker was able to read a file outside the intended cache scope using path traversal.
    9. **Expected Result (Mitigated Case - if mitigations were implemented by user):** The application does not output the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt` and ideally raises an error or returns a safe response, indicating that path traversal was prevented.

    This test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability in a user-implemented `load_from_source` method if cache keys are not properly sanitized when constructing file paths.

- SQL Injection in SQLAlchemyResource via `where` clause

    #### Vulnerability Name
    SQL Injection in SQLAlchemyResource via `where` clause

    #### Description
    1. A developer uses the `SQLAlchemyResource` class from the `kiwi-cache` library to cache data from a database table.
    2. The developer allows user-controlled input to be incorporated into the `where` clause of the SQLAlchemy query, which is used to filter data from the database.
    3. An attacker can manipulate this user-controlled input to inject malicious SQL code into the `where` clause.
    4. When the `_get_source_data` method of `SQLAlchemyResource` executes the SQLAlchemy query, the injected SQL code is executed against the database.
    5. This allows the attacker to bypass intended data filtering and potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, depending on the database user's permissions and the nature of the injected SQL code.

    #### Impact
    - Data Breach: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database by manipulating the SQL query to bypass intended filtering and retrieve data they should not have access to.
    - Data Manipulation: Depending on the database user's permissions and the injected SQL code, attackers might be able to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues.
    - Potential for privilege escalation if the database user connected by the application has elevated privileges.

    #### Vulnerability Rank
    High

    #### Currently Implemented Mitigations
    None. The `kiwi-cache` library does not implement any input sanitization or parameterized queries within the `SQLAlchemyResource` component to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The library relies on the developers using it to implement their own sanitization when constructing the `where` clause.

    #### Missing Mitigations
    - **Input Sanitization:** The `SQLAlchemyResource` should implement input sanitization or use parameterized queries for the `where` clause to prevent SQL injection. However, due to the design of allowing arbitrary `ColumnElement` for `where` clause, sanitization within the library might be complex and restrict functionality.
    - **Documentation Warning:** The documentation should explicitly warn developers about the risk of SQL injection if user-provided data is directly used to construct the `where` clause without proper sanitization. It should recommend using SQLAlchemy's parameterized query capabilities or sanitizing user inputs before incorporating them into the `where` clause.

    #### Preconditions
    - A developer must be using the `SQLAlchemyResource` class from the `kiwi-cache` library.
    - The developer must be constructing the `where` clause for `SQLAlchemyResource` using user-controlled input.
    - The user-controlled input must not be properly sanitized or validated before being used in the `where` clause.

    #### Source Code Analysis
    - File: `/code/kw/cache/dbcache.py`
    - Class `SQLAlchemyResource` is defined, inheriting from `KiwiCache`.
    - Method `_get_source_data` is responsible for fetching data from the database.
    - Line:
        ```python
        if self.where is not None:
            query = query.where(self.where)
        ```
        - This code directly incorporates the `self.where` attribute into the SQLAlchemy query using `query.where()`.
        - The `self.where` attribute is defined as:
        ```python
        where = attr.ib(
            None, type=ColumnElement, validator=attr.validators.optional(attr.validators.instance_of(ColumnElement))
        )
        ```
        - The `where` attribute, of type `ColumnElement`, allows developers to pass arbitrary SQLAlchemy conditions.
        - If a developer constructs this `ColumnElement` using unsanitized user input, it will be directly embedded into the SQL query executed by SQLAlchemy.
    - Line:
        ```python
        fetchall = self.session.execute(query.select_from(table(self.table_name))).fetchall()
        ```
        - This line executes the constructed SQLAlchemy query against the database. If malicious SQL code is injected into the `where` clause, it will be executed at this point.

    #### Security Test Case
    1. Setup:
        - Assume a database table named `users` with columns `id`, `username`, and `password`.
        - Create a `SQLAlchemyResource` instance to cache data from the `users` table, using `username` as the key and selecting all columns.
        - Assume the `where` clause is intended to filter users based on a username provided by a user through an HTTP request parameter, e.g., `user_param`.
    2. Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual - within `load_from_source` or similar method implemented by developer using kiwi-cache):
        ```python
        class UserCache(SQLAlchemyResource):
            def __init__(self, redis_client, db_session, user_param): # user_param is from request
                super().__init__(redis_client, db_session, 'users', key='username', columns=['*'], where=text(f"username = '{user_param}'")) # vulnerable line

        # ... in application code ...
        user_cache = UserCache(redis_instance, db_session_instance, request.GET.get('username')) # username from request parameter
        user_data = user_cache['some_username']
        ```
    3. Attack Scenario:
        - An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated `username` parameter designed to inject SQL code.
        - Example malicious `username` parameter value: `' OR '1'='1`
        - This malicious input is passed to the `UserCache` constructor and incorporated into the `where` clause without sanitization.
        - The resulting `where` clause becomes: `WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`
        - When `_get_source_data` executes this query, the condition `'1'='1'` is always true, effectively bypassing the intended username filtering.
        - The query will return all rows from the `users` table instead of just the user with the intended username.
    4. Test Steps:
        - Prepare a test database with a `users` table and some sample data (including sensitive data in the `password` column).
        - Instantiate `SQLAlchemyResource` (or a subclass like `UserCache` in the example) in a test environment, mimicking the vulnerable code structure.
        - Construct a malicious input string for the `where` clause (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`).
        - Pass this malicious input as the `user_param` during `SQLAlchemyResource` instantiation (or in a way that it influences the `where` clause construction).
        - Execute a query through the cache (e.g., by accessing `user_cache['test_key']`).
        - Observe the executed SQL query (e.g., through database logs or SQLAlchemy's query logging). Verify that the injected SQL code is present in the executed query.
        - Check the returned data. Confirm that the query returned more data than intended (e.g., all users instead of a specific user), demonstrating successful SQL injection and data exfiltration.
    5. Expected Result:
        - The security test case should demonstrate that by providing a crafted input, an attacker can manipulate the `where` clause and cause the application to execute unintended SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, thus proving the SQL injection vulnerability.
