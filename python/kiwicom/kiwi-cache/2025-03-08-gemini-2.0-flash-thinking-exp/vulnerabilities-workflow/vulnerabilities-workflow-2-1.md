### Vulnerability List

- Potential Path Traversal in User-Implemented `load_from_source`

#### Vulnerability Name
Potential Path Traversal in User-Implemented `load_from_source`

#### Description
If a user implements the `load_from_source` method in a subclass of `KiwiCache` and uses user-controlled cache keys to construct file paths without proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially craft malicious cache keys to access files outside the intended cache scope.

**Step-by-step trigger:**
1. An application developer creates a subclass of `KiwiCache` (or `AioKiwiCache`) and implements the `load_from_source` method.
2. Within the `load_from_source` method, the developer uses the cache key (which can be influenced by user input) to construct a file path for reading data.
3. The developer fails to sanitize or validate the cache key to prevent path traversal attempts.
4. An attacker crafts a malicious cache key containing path traversal sequences like `../` (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`).
5. The attacker triggers the application to request data from the cache using the malicious key.
6. The `load_from_source` method, upon receiving the malicious key, constructs a file path based on this unsanitized input.
7. Due to the path traversal sequences, the constructed file path resolves to a location outside the intended cache directory, potentially accessing sensitive files.
8. The `load_from_source` method reads the content of the file at the traversed path and returns it as cache data.
9. The attacker receives the content of the sensitive file, which was unintentionally exposed due to the path traversal vulnerability.

#### Impact
Unauthorized file access. An attacker can read sensitive files on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure, exposure of credentials, or further system compromise. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the files accessible through path traversal.

#### Vulnerability Rank
High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
None. The `kiwi-cache` library itself does not provide any built-in mitigations against path traversal vulnerabilities in user-implemented `load_from_source` methods. The security relies entirely on the user's secure implementation of this method.

#### Missing Mitigations
- **Documentation and Warnings:** The library documentation should prominently highlight the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if user-provided cache keys are used to construct file paths in the `load_from_source` method. It should strongly recommend sanitizing and validating cache keys to prevent path traversal attacks.
- **Code Examples and Best Practices:** The documentation could include code examples demonstrating how to safely handle file paths and sanitize user inputs within the `load_from_source` method. This could include using functions like `os.path.basename` to extract safe filenames or validating the cache key against a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns.

#### Preconditions
1. The application must use the `kiwi-cache` library and implement a subclass of `KiwiCache` (or `AioKiwiCache`).
2. The subclass must implement the `load_from_source` method to read data from files based on cache keys.
3. The `load_from_source` method must construct file paths using user-controlled cache keys without proper sanitization.
4. An attacker must be able to influence or control the cache keys used to access the cache.

#### Source Code Analysis
1. **`kw.cache.base.KiwiCache` and `kw.cache.aio.AioKiwiCache` classes:** These are base classes that define the caching mechanism. They require users to implement the `load_from_source` method.
2. **`load_from_source` method (not implemented in `kiwi-cache`):** This method is intended to be implemented by users in their subclasses. The `kiwi-cache` library does not dictate how this method should be implemented, giving flexibility to users but also introducing potential security risks if implemented insecurely.
3. **User-controlled cache keys:** The cache is accessed using keys, e.g., `cache['user_provided_key']`. If these keys are directly used to construct file paths in `load_from_source` without sanitization, a path traversal vulnerability can occur.

**Example of Vulnerable `load_from_source` Implementation (Conceptual):**

```python
import os
import redis
from kw.cache import KiwiCache

class VulnerableFileCache(KiwiCache):
    def load_from_source(self):
        base_dir = '/var/app/cache_files/'
        filename = self._key_suffix  # Assuming _key_suffix is derived from the cache key
        filepath = os.path.join(base_dir, filename) # Vulnerable path construction
        try:
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
            return {'file_content': content}
        except IOError:
            return {}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    cache = VulnerableFileCache(resources_redis=redis_client)
    # Attacker provides a malicious key: '../../../etc/passwd'
    malicious_key = '../../../etc/passwd'
    try:
        file_data = cache[malicious_key]
        print(f"File content: {file_data}") # In vulnerable case, prints content of /etc/passwd
    except KeyError:
        print(f"Key '{malicious_key}' not found in cache or source.")
```

In this example, if an attacker provides a cache key like `'../../../etc/passwd'`, the `load_from_source` method will construct the path `/var/app/cache_files/../../../etc/passwd`, which simplifies to `/etc/passwd`, leading to unauthorized access.

#### Security Test Case
**Step-by-step test:**
1. **Setup Vulnerable Application:** Create a Python application that uses the `kiwi-cache` library and includes the `VulnerableFileCache` class as described in the Source Code Analysis example. Ensure that the `base_dir` in `VulnerableFileCache` is set to a suitable directory for testing (e.g., a temporary directory). Create a test file (e.g., `test_sensitive_file.txt`) within a directory that should be inaccessible via path traversal, and place a copy of it inside the `base_dir` under the name `safe_file.txt`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install `kiwi-cache` and `redis-py`.
3. **Run Redis Server:** Ensure a Redis server is running and accessible to the application.
4. **Execute Vulnerable Code:** Run the Python application.
5. **Craft Malicious Key:** Prepare a malicious cache key designed to traverse directories and access the `test_sensitive_file.txt` located outside the intended `base_dir`. For example, if `base_dir` is `/tmp/cache/`, and `test_sensitive_file.txt` is in `/tmp/`, a malicious key could be `'../../test_sensitive_file.txt'`.
6. **Access Cache with Malicious Key:** Send a request to the application to access the cache using the malicious key. This will typically involve calling `cache[malicious_key]`.
7. **Verify File Access:** Check the output of the application. If the path traversal is successful, the application will read and output the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt` (or attempt to, depending on file permissions). If the vulnerability is not present or mitigated, the application should either raise a `KeyError` (if the file isn't intended to be accessed) or access only the `safe_file.txt` within the intended `base_dir`.
8. **Expected Result (Vulnerable Case):** The application outputs the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt`, demonstrating that the attacker was able to read a file outside the intended cache scope using path traversal.
9. **Expected Result (Mitigated Case - if mitigations were implemented by user):** The application does not output the content of `test_sensitive_file.txt` and ideally raises an error or returns a safe response, indicating that path traversal was prevented.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability in a user-implemented `load_from_source` method if cache keys are not properly sanitized when constructing file paths.
