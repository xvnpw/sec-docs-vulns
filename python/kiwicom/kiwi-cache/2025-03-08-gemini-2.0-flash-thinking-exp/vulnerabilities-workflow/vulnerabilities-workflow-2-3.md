- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in SQLAlchemyResource via `where` clause
- Description:
    1. A developer uses the `SQLAlchemyResource` class from the `kiwi-cache` library to cache data from a database table.
    2. The developer allows user-controlled input to be incorporated into the `where` clause of the SQLAlchemy query, which is used to filter data from the database.
    3. An attacker can manipulate this user-controlled input to inject malicious SQL code into the `where` clause.
    4. When the `_get_source_data` method of `SQLAlchemyResource` executes the SQLAlchemy query, the injected SQL code is executed against the database.
    5. This allows the attacker to bypass intended data filtering and potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, depending on the database user's permissions and the nature of the injected SQL code.
- Impact:
    - Data Breach: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database by manipulating the SQL query to bypass intended filtering and retrieve data they should not have access to.
    - Data Manipulation: Depending on the database user's permissions and the injected SQL code, attackers might be able to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues.
    - Potential for privilege escalation if the database user connected by the application has elevated privileges.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `kiwi-cache` library does not implement any input sanitization or parameterized queries within the `SQLAlchemyResource` component to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The library relies on the developers using it to implement their own sanitization when constructing the `where` clause.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: The `SQLAlchemyResource` should implement input sanitization or use parameterized queries for the `where` clause to prevent SQL injection. However, due to the design of allowing arbitrary `ColumnElement` for `where` clause, sanitization within the library might be complex and restrict functionality.
    - Documentation Warning: The documentation should explicitly warn developers about the risk of SQL injection if user-provided data is directly used to construct the `where` clause without proper sanitization. It should recommend using SQLAlchemy's parameterized query capabilities or sanitizing user inputs before incorporating them into the `where` clause.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer must be using the `SQLAlchemyResource` class from the `kiwi-cache` library.
    - The developer must be constructing the `where` clause for `SQLAlchemyResource` using user-controlled input.
    - The user-controlled input must not be properly sanitized or validated before being used in the `where` clause.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/kw/cache/dbcache.py`
    - Class `SQLAlchemyResource` is defined, inheriting from `KiwiCache`.
    - Method `_get_source_data` is responsible for fetching data from the database.
    - Line:
        ```python
        if self.where is not None:
            query = query.where(self.where)
        ```
        - This code directly incorporates the `self.where` attribute into the SQLAlchemy query using `query.where()`.
        - The `self.where` attribute is defined as:
        ```python
        where = attr.ib(
            None, type=ColumnElement, validator=attr.validators.optional(attr.validators.instance_of(ColumnElement))
        )
        ```
        - The `where` attribute, of type `ColumnElement`, allows developers to pass arbitrary SQLAlchemy conditions.
        - If a developer constructs this `ColumnElement` using unsanitized user input, it will be directly embedded into the SQL query executed by SQLAlchemy.
        - Line:
        ```python
        fetchall = self.session.execute(query.select_from(table(self.table_name))).fetchall()
        ```
        - This line executes the constructed SQLAlchemy query against the database. If malicious SQL code is injected into the `where` clause, it will be executed at this point.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Assume a database table named `users` with columns `id`, `username`, and `password`.
        - Create a `SQLAlchemyResource` instance to cache data from the `users` table, using `username` as the key and selecting all columns.
        - Assume the `where` clause is intended to filter users based on a username provided by a user through an HTTP request parameter, e.g., `user_param`.
    2. Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual - within `load_from_source` or similar method implemented by developer using kiwi-cache):
        ```python
        class UserCache(SQLAlchemyResource):
            def __init__(self, redis_client, db_session, user_param): # user_param is from request
                super().__init__(redis_client, db_session, 'users', key='username', columns=['*'], where=text(f"username = '{user_param}'")) # vulnerable line

        # ... in application code ...
        user_cache = UserCache(redis_instance, db_session_instance, request.GET.get('username')) # username from request parameter
        user_data = user_cache['some_username']
        ```
    3. Attack Scenario:
        - An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated `username` parameter designed to inject SQL code.
        - Example malicious `username` parameter value: `' OR '1'='1`
        - This malicious input is passed to the `UserCache` constructor and incorporated into the `where` clause without sanitization.
        - The resulting `where` clause becomes: `WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`
        - When `_get_source_data` executes this query, the condition `'1'='1'` is always true, effectively bypassing the intended username filtering.
        - The query will return all rows from the `users` table instead of just the user with the intended username.
    4. Test Steps:
        - Prepare a test database with a `users` table and some sample data (including sensitive data in the `password` column).
        - Instantiate `SQLAlchemyResource` (or a subclass like `UserCache` in the example) in a test environment, mimicking the vulnerable code structure.
        - Construct a malicious input string for the `where` clause (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`).
        - Pass this malicious input as the `user_param` during `SQLAlchemyResource` instantiation (or in a way that it influences the `where` clause construction).
        - Execute a query through the cache (e.g., by accessing `user_cache['test_key']`).
        - Observe the executed SQL query (e.g., through database logs or SQLAlchemy's query logging). Verify that the injected SQL code is present in the executed query.
        - Check the returned data. Confirm that the query returned more data than intended (e.g., all users instead of a specific user), demonstrating successful SQL injection and data exfiltration.
    5. Expected Result:
        - The security test case should demonstrate that by providing a crafted input, an attacker can manipulate the `where` clause and cause the application to execute unintended SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, thus proving the SQL injection vulnerability.
