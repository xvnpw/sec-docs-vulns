### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Elasticsearch Endpoint Exposure due to Missing Default Authentication

*   #### Description:
    The Elasticsearch Helm chart, when deployed with default configurations, does not enforce authentication. By default, the Elasticsearch service is configured with `service.type: ClusterIP`, which is not exposed to the public internet by default. However, users might intentionally or inadvertently change this to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` to access Elasticsearch from outside the Kubernetes cluster. If this change is made, or if network policies are misconfigured, and the Elasticsearch cluster is exposed without enabling authentication, anyone who can reach the service can access the Elasticsearch API without providing any credentials. An attacker can then perform any Elasticsearch operation, including reading, modifying, and deleting indices and data.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Deploy the Elasticsearch module using Helm with default configurations, ensuring no security configurations are explicitly set in `values.yaml`.
    2. Optionally, modify the `values.yaml` to set `service.type` to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` to expose the service externally. If using `ClusterIP`, ensure network access to the cluster network to simulate internal attacker.
    3. Determine the service endpoint of the Elasticsearch cluster. If `service.type` is `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, use the external IP or Node IP and Port. If `ClusterIP`, use the ClusterIP or port-forward the service.
    4. Access the Elasticsearch API endpoint (e.g., `http://<elasticsearch-endpoint>:9200`) using a web browser, `curl`, or any HTTP client.
    5. Observe that the Elasticsearch API is accessible without any authentication challenge. You can access cluster information, data, and perform administrative tasks without providing credentials. For example, accessing `http://<elasticsearch-endpoint>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty` will return cluster health information.

*   #### Impact:
    Critical data breach and data integrity risk. Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster can lead to severe security breaches. An attacker could:
    *   **Data Breach:** Read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch indices, leading to confidentiality breaches and data loss.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Inject malicious data, corrupt existing data, or perform ransomware attacks by deleting indices, leading to data integrity issues and potential system malfunctions.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Shut down the Elasticsearch cluster, overload it with requests, or modify cluster settings to cause instability, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Cluster Takeover:** Gain full administrative access to the Elasticsearch cluster and potentially complete system compromise.

*   #### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

*   #### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   The default `service.type` is `ClusterIP`, which is only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster, offering some level of network isolation by default.
    *   The documentation in `/code/chart/README.md` and examples like `/code/chart/examples/security/security.yml` guide users on how to enable security features like authentication and SSL/TLS.
    *   The `security.yml` example demonstrates how to enable `xpack.security.enabled: true` and configure authentication using secrets for username and password.
    *   The chart provides configuration options to enable security features like X-Pack Security through `esConfig` and `secretMounts`, as demonstrated in the `examples/security` directory, but these are opt-in and not enabled by default.

*   #### Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Enable Basic Authentication by Default (Recommended):** The most effective mitigation would be to enable basic authentication by default. This could be achieved by setting up a default username and password and enabling Elasticsearch security features in the default `esConfig`.
    *   **Prompt for Authentication Configuration:** If default authentication is not desired, the chart could prompt the user to configure authentication during the deployment process, forcing them to make an explicit security decision.
    *   **Strong Security Warning and Guidance:** Include a very strong and prominent security warning in the README and `values.yaml` emphasizing the critical importance of enabling authentication and the severe risks of running Elasticsearch in production without it. Provide step-by-step instructions and examples on how to enable authentication using X-Pack Security or other methods.
    *   **Security Warning in README and values.yaml:** Add a prominent security warning in the README and `values.yaml` files, specifically when discussing `service.type`, highlighting the risks of setting it to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` without proper security measures.
    *   **Guidance on Secure Service Exposure:** Provide clear guidance and examples on how to securely expose the Elasticsearch service if needed, including enabling authentication, network policies, and ingress configurations with authentication.
    *   **Implement network policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network access to the Elasticsearch service within the Kubernetes cluster by default. This is not directly part of the module, but could be mentioned in documentation as a recommended security measure.

*   #### Preconditions:
    *   Default deployment of the Elasticsearch module using Helm without any modifications to security settings in `values.yaml`.
    *   The user modifies the `values.yaml` to set `service.type` to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, or the default `ClusterIP` service is accessible due to network misconfiguration or attacker access to the cluster network.
    *   No additional security measures like Elasticsearch security features (e.g., X-Pack Security) or network restrictions are configured.

*   #### Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **File: `/code/chart/values.yaml`**:
        ```yaml
        service:
          type: ClusterIP
        esConfig: {}
        ```
        *   This section in `values.yaml` defines the default `service.type` as `ClusterIP`. If a user alters `values.yaml` to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, the deployed service will reflect this change, potentially making Elasticsearch publicly accessible.
        *   The default `esConfig` is empty, indicating that no Elasticsearch configuration, including security settings like `xpack.security.enabled: true`, is applied by default. This results in Elasticsearch starting without authentication enabled.

    2.  **File: `/code/chart/templates/service.yaml`**:
        ```yaml
        spec:
          type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
        ```
        *   This template uses the value from `values.yaml` to set the `type` of the Kubernetes Service resource.

    3.  **File: `/code/chart/examples/security/security.yml`**:
        ```yaml
        esConfig:
          elasticsearch.yml: |
            xpack.security.enabled: true
        ```
        *   This example configuration demonstrates how to enable X-Pack Security by modifying `esConfig`, proving that security features are available but not default.

                                                                      |               # No authentication by default |
                                                                      +---------------------------------------+
    ```

*   #### Security Test Case:
    1.  Deploy the Elasticsearch module using Helm with the default `values.yaml` file, ensuring no security configurations are explicitly set. For external access test, set `service.type: LoadBalancer` in `values.yaml`.
        ```yaml
        service:
          type: LoadBalancer
        ```
    2.  After deployment, retrieve the external IP address assigned to the LoadBalancer service by Kubernetes (e.g., using `kubectl get service <elasticsearch-service-name>`). Let's say the external IP is `EXTERNAL_IP`.
    3.  From an external network (outside the Kubernetes cluster), use `curl` or a web browser to access the Elasticsearch cluster health endpoint on port 9200 using the external IP address: `curl http://EXTERNAL_IP:9200/_cluster/health`.
    4.  Observe if the cluster health information is returned without requiring any authentication. If the health status is accessible without credentials, the vulnerability is confirmed. You should receive a JSON response containing the Elasticsearch cluster health information.
    5.  To further verify, attempt to create an index without authentication: `curl -XPUT 'http://EXTERNAL_IP:9200/test_index?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"settings": {"number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 0}}'`. If successful, this also confirms the vulnerability.
