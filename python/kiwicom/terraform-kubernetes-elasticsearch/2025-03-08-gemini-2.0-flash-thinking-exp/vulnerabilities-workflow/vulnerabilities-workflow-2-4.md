### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Elasticsearch API exposed without authentication

*   #### Description:
    The Elasticsearch cluster, when deployed using default configurations of this Terraform module, exposes its API endpoint without requiring any authentication. This means that anyone who can reach the service (depending on the Kubernetes Service type and network configuration) can access and interact with the Elasticsearch API.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Deploy the Elasticsearch cluster using the Terraform module with default configurations, specifically without enabling security features like authentication.
    2. Determine the service endpoint of the Elasticsearch cluster. If `service.type` is `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, or if an Ingress is configured to expose the service, the endpoint might be publicly accessible. If `service.type` is `ClusterIP`, it will be accessible within the Kubernetes cluster network.
    3. Access the Elasticsearch API endpoint (e.g., `http://<elasticsearch-endpoint>:9200`) using a web browser, `curl`, or any HTTP client.
    4. Observe that the Elasticsearch API is accessible without any authentication challenge. You can access cluster information, data, and perform administrative tasks without providing credentials. For example, accessing `http://<elasticsearch-endpoint>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty` will return cluster health information.

*   #### Impact:
    Critical. Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch API can lead to severe security breaches. An attacker could:
    *   **Data Breach:** Read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch indices.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Inject malicious data, corrupt existing data, or perform ransomware attacks by deleting indices.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Shut down the Elasticsearch cluster, overload it with requests, or modify cluster settings to cause instability.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** If the Elasticsearch cluster is in a privileged network, successful exploitation could be a stepping stone for further attacks on other systems within the network.

*   #### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

*   #### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None by default. The module does not enforce or enable authentication in its default configuration.
    *   The documentation (`/code/chart/README.md` and `/code/chart/examples/security/security.yml`) provides guidance and examples on how to enable security features, including:
        *   Enabling X-Pack security in `esConfig.elasticsearch.yml`.
        *   Configuring TLS for transport and HTTP layers.
        *   Mounting secrets for passwords and certificates using `secretMounts` and `keystore`.
        *   Example `security/security.yml` demonstrates enabling security features.

*   #### Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Enable Authentication by Default:** The most effective mitigation would be to enable basic authentication by default. This could be achieved by:
        *   Generating default credentials (username/password) and storing them as Kubernetes secrets.
        *   Automatically configuring Elasticsearch to use basic authentication with these default credentials in the default `esConfig`.
        *   Clearly documenting how to change these default credentials and best practices for secure credential management.
    *   **Network Policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network access to the Elasticsearch service to only authorized clients within the cluster. This is not directly part of the module, but could be mentioned in documentation as a recommended security measure.
    *   **Service Type Restriction:** Default to `ClusterIP` service type and strongly discourage or warn against using `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` in production without proper security configurations.
    *   **Security Context Hardening:** While the module includes `securityContext` and `podSecurityContext`, further hardening based on security best practices for containers could be beneficial. However, this is less directly related to the API exposure vulnerability.

*   #### Preconditions:
    *   An Elasticsearch cluster deployed using this Terraform module with default configurations (or without explicitly enabling security features).
    *   Network access to the Elasticsearch service endpoint. The level of access required depends on the Kubernetes Service type and network setup. Public internet access is a precondition for maximum risk if `LoadBalancer`, `NodePort` or Ingress are used to expose the service publicly without further access control.

*   #### Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`/code/chart/values.yaml`**:
        *   Reviewing `values.yaml`, there is no default configuration that enables Elasticsearch security features like authentication or authorization.
        *   `ingress.enabled` is set to `false` by default, which mitigates public exposure via Ingress *unless* explicitly enabled by the user.
        *   `service.type` is set to `ClusterIP` by default, which limits exposure to within the Kubernetes cluster network *unless* changed to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` by the user.
        *   `esConfig` is empty by default, meaning no custom Elasticsearch configuration is applied out-of-the-box that would enable security.
    2.  **`/code/chart/templates/statefulset.yaml`**:
        *   The `statefulset.yaml` template does not include any security initialization or enforcement of authentication within the Elasticsearch container specification.
        *   It allows users to inject configurations via `esConfig` ConfigMap and secrets via `secretMounts`, but these are optional and not used by default to enable security.
    3.  **`/code/chart/templates/service.yaml`**:
        *   The `service.yaml` template creates a Kubernetes Service to expose Elasticsearch. The default `service.type: ClusterIP` setting, while not publicly exposed by default, still allows access from within the cluster network without authentication.
        *   The template does not enforce any network-level access controls.
    4.  **`/code/chart/examples/security/security.yml`**:
        *   This example demonstrates how to enable security features, explicitly showing that security is *not* enabled by default. It requires setting `xpack.security.enabled: true` and configuring credentials and TLS certificates.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    [External Network/Internal Kubernetes Network] --> [Kubernetes Service (default: ClusterIP)] --> [Elasticsearch Pods] --> Elasticsearch API (NO AUTHENTICATION)
    ```

    In the default setup, requests can reach the Elasticsearch API through the Kubernetes Service. Since no authentication is configured by default, any request reaching the API will be processed without verification.

*   #### Security Test Case:
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Deploy the Elasticsearch cluster using the Terraform module with default settings. For example, using the provided `examples/default` configuration.
        *   Ensure you have `kubectl` configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster where Elasticsearch is deployed.
        *   Determine the Elasticsearch service endpoint. If `service.type` is `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, use the external IP or Node IP and Port. If `ClusterIP`, you may need to port-forward or execute commands from within the cluster. For simplicity, assume `service.type` is `LoadBalancer` and you have the external IP.
    2.  **Steps:**
        a.  Get the external IP address of the Elasticsearch service (assuming `service.type: LoadBalancer`). Let's say it is `ELASTICSEARCH_IP`.
        b.  Open a web browser or use `curl` from your local machine (acting as an external attacker).
        c.  Access the Elasticsearch cluster health endpoint without providing any credentials: `http://ELASTICSEARCH_IP:9200/_cluster/health?pretty`.
        d.  **Expected Result:** You should receive a JSON response containing the Elasticsearch cluster health information, similar to:
            ```json
            {
              "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
              "status" : "green",
              "timed_out" : false,
              "number_of_nodes" : 3,
              "number_of_data_nodes" : 3,
              "active_primary_shards" : 1,
              "active_shards" : 1,
              "relocating_shards" : 0,
              "initializing_shards" : 0,
              "unassigned_shards" : 0,
              "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
              "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
              "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
              "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
              "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
            }
            ```
        e.  **Verification:** The successful retrieval of cluster health information without any authentication proves that the Elasticsearch API is exposed without authentication, confirming the vulnerability.
