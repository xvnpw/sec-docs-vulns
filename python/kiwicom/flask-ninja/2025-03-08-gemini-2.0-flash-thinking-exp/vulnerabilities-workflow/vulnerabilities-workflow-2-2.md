### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Type Mismatch in Power Operation with Negative Exponent
- Description:
    1. An attacker sends a GET request to the `/compute` endpoint with a negative integer value for the parameter `b` (e.g., `b=-2`).
    2. Flask-Ninja, relying on type hints, validates that `a` and `b` are integers.
    3. The application calculates `a ** b`. With a negative `b`, the result of the power operation might be a float (e.g., `2 ** -2 = 0.25`).
    4. The API endpoint is defined to return a `Response` model where the `power` field is annotated as an integer (`int`).
    5. Flask-Ninja attempts to validate the response against the `Response` model. Pydantic's validation fails because it tries to assign a float value (the result of `a ** b`) to an integer field (`power`).
    6. Flask-Ninja catches the Pydantic `ValidationError` and returns an HTTP 400 response with a JSON error message indicating a validation failure.
- Impact:
    - Application error (HTTP 400 response returned to the client).
    - Information Disclosure: The 400 error response may contain details from the Pydantic validation error, potentially revealing internal data types and validation processes to the attacker.
    - Unexpected API Behavior: The API is intended to return integer results for all operations, including power, but fails to do so correctly when a negative exponent is used, leading to an error.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Type hints in the `compute` function signature (`a: int, b: int`) enforce that the input parameters `a` and `b` are integers, preventing non-integer input types.
    - The `Response` Pydantic model enforces that the `power` field is an integer, validating the response data type.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Business logic validation to handle negative exponents explicitly.
    - Define the intended behavior for the power operation with negative exponents. Should it:
        - Disallow negative exponents and return an error if `b < 0`?
        - Round the float result to the nearest integer?
        - Change the return type of `power` to float in the `Response` model?
    - Implement explicit input validation within the `compute` function to check for negative values of `b` if they are not intended to be supported, and return a custom error response with a more user-friendly message instead of relying on Pydantic validation errors for this specific case.
- Preconditions:
    - The Flask-Ninja application is deployed and running.
    - The `/compute` endpoint, as defined in the `README.md` example, is implemented and accessible.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/README.md`
        ```python
        @api.get("/compute")
        def compute(a: int, b: int) -> Response:
            return Response(
                sum=a + b,
                difference=a - b,
                product=a * b,
                power=a ** b
            )
        ```
        - The `/compute` endpoint is defined with type hints for integer inputs `a` and `b` and an integer output field `power` in the `Response` model.
        - The code directly calculates `a ** b` without any checks for negative values of `b` or handling potential float results.
    - File: `/code/flask_ninja/operation.py`
        ```python
        def run(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
            # ... parameter validation ...
            resp = self.view_func(*args, **kwargs)
            # ... response validation ...
            for code, model in self.responses.items():
                if isinstance(resp, get_origin(model.type_) or model.type_):
                    if isinstance(resp, str):
                        return resp, code
                    return jsonify(self.serialize(resp)), code
            raise ApiConfigError(f"No response schema matches returned type {type(resp)}")
        ```
        - The `run` method in `Operation` class handles request execution and response validation.
        - It uses `isinstance` to check if the response matches the defined response model type.
        - If the response validation against the Pydantic model (implicitly done within `jsonify` and serialization) fails due to type mismatch, a 400 error is returned because of the `ValidationError` handling in the `run` method.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Start the Flask application with the `/compute` endpoint from the `README.md` example.
    2. Send the following GET request to the `/compute` endpoint using `curl` or a similar tool:
        ```bash
        curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/compute?a=2&b=-2"
        ```
    3. Observe the HTTP response.
    4. Expected Result:
        - HTTP Status Code: `400 Bad Request`
        - Response Body (JSON): Should contain a Pydantic `ValidationError` indicating that the value for the `power` field is not a valid integer, for example:
            ```json
            {
                "detail": [
                    {
                        "type": "int_from_float",
                        "loc": [
                            "response",
                            "power"
                        ],
                        "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, got a number with a fractional part",
                        "input": 0.25,
                        "ctx": {
                            "error": "ValueError('cannot convert float to int')"
                        },
                        "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.4/v/int_from_float"
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```
        - Verify that the response status code is 400 and the body contains a validation error related to the `power` field expecting an integer but receiving a float. This confirms the type mismatch vulnerability when using negative exponents in the `/compute` endpoint.
