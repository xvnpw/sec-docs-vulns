* Vulnerability Name: Missing Input Validation for large integers

* Description:
    1. An attacker can send a GET request to the `/compute` endpoint with extremely large integer values for parameters `a` and `b`.
    2. The Flask-Ninja application, relying on Pydantic's type validation, will accept these large integers as valid input because Python natively supports arbitrary-precision integers.
    3. While this won't cause a typical integer overflow in Python, processing extremely large numbers can lead to increased resource consumption on the server and potentially unexpected behavior in specific application contexts or integrations if the result of the computation is used elsewhere where large integers might not be handled as gracefully.

* Impact:
    - Low. Although Python handles arbitrary size integers, processing very large numbers can lead to increased CPU and memory usage. In scenarios where the computed result is used in downstream systems with limitations on integer size, it might lead to unexpected errors or misbehavior in those systems.

* Vulnerability Rank: Low

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Pydantic's built-in type validation ensures that parameters `a` and `b` are integers as declared in the function signature. This is handled by Pydantic during request processing within the `Operation.run` method, specifically when validating and converting query parameters using `param.type_adapter.validate_python(request.args[param.alias])` in `/code/flask_ninja/operation.py`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement explicit validation to limit the maximum acceptable size or range of integer inputs `a` and `b` in the `/compute` endpoint. This could be achieved using Pydantic field validators (e.g., `Field(le=...)`, `Field(lt=...)`) or custom validation functions within the `compute` endpoint definition.

* Preconditions:
    - The Flask-Ninja application with the `/compute` endpoint as defined in the `README.md` must be running and accessible.
    - The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the application.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Endpoint Definition:** In `/code/README.md`, the `compute` endpoint is defined as:
    ```python
    @api.get("/compute")
    def compute(a: int, b: int) -> Response:
        return Response(
            sum=a + b,
            difference=a - b,
            product=a * b,
            power=a ** b
        )
    ```
    Here, `a: int` and `b: int` type hints enforce integer type validation by Pydantic.
    2. **Parameter Handling in `Operation.run`:** In `/code/flask-ninja/operation.py`, the `Operation.run` method handles request processing:
    ```python
    def run(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        # ...
        try:
            for param in self.params:
                # Parse query params
                field_info = cast(FuncParam, param.field_info)
                if field_info.in_ == ParamType.QUERY and param.name in request.args:
                    kwargs[param.name] = param.type_adapter.validate_python(
                        request.args[param.alias]
                    )
        except ValidationError as validation_error:
            return validation_error.json(), 400
        # ...
        resp = self.view_func(*args, **kwargs)
        # ...
    ```
    This code snippet shows that Flask-Ninja relies on `param.type_adapter.validate_python` to validate and convert the input based on the type hints (like `int`). Pydantic's `TypeAdapter` for `int` will successfully parse and validate arbitrarily large integers without imposing size restrictions, as this is standard Python behavior. There are no explicit checks to limit the size of these integers within the provided code.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Start a Flask-Ninja application with the `/compute` endpoint as defined in `README.md`.
    2. **Craft Malicious Request:** Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a GET request to the `/compute` endpoint with very large integer values for `a` and `b`. For example:
    ```bash
    curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/compute?a=999999999999999999999999999999&b=999999999999999999999999999999"
    ```
    3. **Observe Response:** Examine the HTTP response.
    4. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** The server should return a 200 OK response with a JSON payload containing the computed results (sum, difference, product, power) of these very large numbers. This indicates that the application successfully processed the request without size validation on the integer inputs.
    5. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** After implementing input validation to limit the size of `a` and `b`, sending the same request should result in a 400 Bad Request response. The response body should ideally contain a validation error message indicating that the input integers are too large or out of the allowed range.
