### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Data Masking due to Keyword-Based Blacklist/Whitelist Bypass
*   **Description:** The `mask_dict` function in Kiwi JSON uses a keyword-based blacklist and whitelist to identify dictionary keys that should be masked. This approach is vulnerable to bypasses because attackers can craft key names that do not contain any of the blacklisted keywords or are present in the whitelist, even if they contain sensitive information.  An attacker can exploit this by slightly altering key names to evade the keyword filters, leading to unintentional exposure of sensitive data in the JSON output.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An application using Kiwi JSON's masking functionality with default or custom blacklist/whitelist is deployed.
    2. An attacker analyzes the application's code or documentation (if available) or performs black-box testing to understand that Kiwi JSON is used and identify the default or common blacklist keywords (e.g., "secret", "token", "password").
    3. The attacker crafts a request or manipulates data that includes sensitive information under keys that are semantically similar to blacklisted keywords but do not contain the exact blacklisted keywords or are added to the whitelist unintentionally. For example, instead of using the key "secret_key", they might use "my_secret_key_value", "account_secrets", or "token_id" if these are not explicitly blacklisted or are mistakenly whitelisted.
    4. The application encodes this data into JSON using `MaskedJSONEncoder` or `mask_dict`.
    5. Due to the keyword-based filtering, the `mask_dict` function fails to identify these modified key names as sensitive because they don't exactly match the blacklist keywords and are not explicitly whitelisted.
    6. The JSON output is generated with the sensitive information under the manipulated keys, bypassing the intended data masking.
    7. The attacker can then access or intercept this JSON output and obtain the unmasked sensitive information.

*   **Impact:** High. Information disclosure of sensitive data. If an attacker successfully bypasses the masking, they can gain access to secrets, tokens, passwords, or other confidential information intended to be protected by the masking mechanism. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security compromises, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the exposed data.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   The project provides `mask_dict_factory` to customize the `placeholder`, `blacklist`, and `whitelist`. This allows developers to define their own sets of keywords. However, this is a configuration option and not an inherent mitigation against the vulnerability itself, as misconfiguration or incomplete lists can still lead to bypasses.
    *   The `MaskedJSONEncoder` and `mask_dict` functions are implemented in `kw/json/encode.py` and `kw/json/utils.py`. These components are intended to provide masking, but the keyword-based approach is inherently flawed for robust security.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Semantic or context-aware masking:** Instead of relying solely on keyword matching, the masking mechanism should be enhanced to understand the semantic context of the data and identify sensitive information based on its meaning and usage, not just keywords in keys.
    *   **Value-based masking:** The current implementation only masks based on keys. Masking should be extended to values as well, especially for keys that are not blacklisted but might contain sensitive data.
    *   **Regular expression or more advanced pattern matching:** Using regular expressions or more sophisticated pattern matching techniques for blacklist/whitelist could improve the accuracy of sensitive data detection compared to simple keyword matching.
    *   **Data type or schema-based masking:** If the application has a defined data schema, masking could be applied based on the expected data type or schema of specific fields, regardless of the key name.
    *   **Content inspection:** For values, implementing content inspection techniques (e.g., entropy analysis, data classification) could help identify and mask sensitive information even if the keys are not indicative of sensitivity.
    *   **Comprehensive default blacklist and customizable rules:** While customization is provided, the default blacklist could be significantly expanded and the system should allow for more complex and flexible masking rules beyond simple blacklist/whitelist.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The application must be using Kiwi JSON's `MaskedJSONEncoder` or `mask_dict` for encoding JSON data that contains sensitive information.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge or be able to guess the blacklist/whitelist keywords being used, or exploit the general weakness of keyword-based filtering.
    *   The sensitive data must be present in a dictionary structure that is processed by the masking function before JSON encoding.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **`kw/json/utils.py` - `mask_dict_factory` and `mask_dict`:**
        ```python
        def mask_dict_factory(
            placeholder=DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER,
            blacklist=DEFAULT_BLACKLIST,
            whitelist=DEFAULT_WHITELIST,
        ):
            def mask_dict(pairs):
                """Return a dict with dangerous looking key/value pairs masked."""
                if pairs is None:
                    return {}

                if isinstance(pairs, dict):
                    items = pairs.items()
                else:
                    items = pairs

                return {
                    key: (
                        placeholder
                        if key.lower() not in whitelist
                        and any(word in key.lower() for word in blacklist)
                        else value
                    )
                    for key, value in items
                }

            return mask_dict

        mask_dict = mask_dict_factory()
        ```
        This code defines the `mask_dict_factory` which creates the `mask_dict` function. The core logic resides within the inner `mask_dict` function. It iterates through key-value pairs (`items`). For each `key`, it checks:
        *   `key.lower() not in whitelist`:  If the lowercased key is NOT in the whitelist.
        *   `any(word in key.lower() for word in blacklist)`: AND if ANY word from the `blacklist` is present in the lowercased key.
        If both conditions are true, the value is replaced with the `placeholder`. Otherwise, the original `value` is kept.

        **Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability lies in the simple keyword-based check. The masking decision is made solely based on the presence of blacklisted keywords in the *key name*.  An attacker can easily bypass this by using variations of key names that are semantically similar but do not contain the exact blacklisted keywords or are mistakenly added to the whitelist.

    2.  **`kw/json/encode.py` - `MaskedJSONEncoder`:**
        ```python
        class MaskedJSONEncoder(BaseJSONEncoder):
            def default(self, o):  # pylint: disable=method-hidden
                return default_encoder(o, mask_dict)

            def encode(self, o):
                if isinstance(o, dict):
                    o = mask_dict(o)
                return super().encode(o)
        ```
        The `MaskedJSONEncoder` class uses the `mask_dict` function.  Crucially, in the `encode` method, it checks `if isinstance(o, dict): o = mask_dict(o)`. This means masking is applied only to the top-level dictionary being encoded. If sensitive dictionaries are nested within other data structures (lists, tuples, or other objects), the masking might not be applied to them directly unless the `default_encoder` recursively calls `mask_dict` (which it does not in the current implementation). However, the primary vulnerability remains in the keyword-based logic of `mask_dict` itself.

*   **Security Test Case:**

    **Test Case Name:** `test_masking_bypass_key_variation`

    **Description:** This test case verifies that the keyword-based masking can be bypassed by using variations of blacklisted keywords in dictionary keys.

    **Steps:**
    1.  Import necessary modules for testing: `json`, `MaskedJSONEncoder`, `mask_dict_factory`.
    2.  Define a custom `mask_dict` with a blacklist containing "secret" and a whitelist containing "public_key".
    3.  Create a dictionary containing sensitive data under keys that are variations of "secret" but are not exactly "secret", and also include a whitelisted key and a regular key. For example:
        ```python
        data = {
            "secret_info": "sensitive_value", # Variation of "secret", should be masked but might not be
            "my_secrets": "another_secret", # Variation of "secret", should be masked but might not be
            "public_key": "public_value", # Whitelisted, should NOT be masked
            "normal_data": "regular_value" # Regular key, should NOT be masked
        }
        ```
    4.  Encode this dictionary using `json.dumps` with the `MaskedJSONEncoder` class.
    5.  Assert that the keys "secret_info" and "my_secrets" are **NOT** masked (i.e., their values are not replaced with the placeholder), while "public_key" and "normal_data" remain unmasked as expected. This demonstrates the bypass.
    6.  (Optional) Assert that if the keys were exactly "secret" or "token" (from default blacklist), they would be masked.

    **Python Test Code Example (using pytest):**
    ```python
    import json
    from kw.json import MaskedJSONEncoder, mask_dict_factory

    def test_masking_bypass_key_variation():
        custom_mask_dict = mask_dict_factory(blacklist=frozenset(["secret"]), whitelist=frozenset(["public_key"]))

        data = {
            "secret_info": "sensitive_value",
            "my_secrets": "another_secret",
            "public_key": "public_value",
            "normal_data": "regular_value"
        }

        expected_output = {
            "secret_info": "sensitive_value",  # <--- Vulnerability: Not Masked!
            "my_secrets": "another_secret",   # <--- Vulnerability: Not Masked!
            "public_key": "public_value",      # Correct: Whitelisted, Not Masked
            "normal_data": "regular_value"     # Correct: Regular, Not Masked
        }

        encoded_json = json.dumps(data, cls=MaskedJSONEncoder) # Uses default mask_dict, not custom_mask_dict, to reflect real usage.
        decoded_data = json.loads(encoded_json)
        assert decoded_data == expected_output

        # Test with custom mask_dict directly (optional, for isolated testing of mask_dict logic)
        masked_data_custom = custom_mask_dict(data)
        assert masked_data_custom == expected_output # Same bypass behavior with custom mask_dict in this scenario.

        # Verify that default blacklist works for exact keyword (optional)
        data_with_exact_secret = {"secret": "real_secret", "normal_data": "regular_value"}
        expected_masked_default = {
            "secret": "-- MASKED --", # Correct: Default blacklist masks "secret"
            "normal_data": "regular_value"
        }
        encoded_json_default = json.dumps(data_with_exact_secret, cls=MaskedJSONEncoder)
        decoded_data_default = json.loads(encoded_json_default)
        assert decoded_data_default == expected_masked_default
    ```
    This test case demonstrates that by slightly altering the key names (e.g., "secret\_info", "my\_secrets"), the keyword-based masking mechanism in Kiwi JSON can be bypassed, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. This highlights the vulnerability of relying solely on keyword matching for data masking.
