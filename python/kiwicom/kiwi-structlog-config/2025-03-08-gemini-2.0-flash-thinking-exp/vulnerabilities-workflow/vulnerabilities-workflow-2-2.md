### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Credit Card Number Anonymization Bypass with Spaces
- Description:
    1. An attacker provides input to the application that includes a credit card number with spaces or other non-digit separators (e.g., "4321 0000 8888 1234").
    2. The application logs this input, and the `Anonymize` processor is configured to mask credit card numbers using the regex `r"\d+(\d{4})"`.
    3. Due to the spaces in the credit card number, the regex `r"\d+(\d{4})"` fails to match the entire credit card number. It might match only the last part after the spaces or a segment of digits at the end.
    4. As a result, the `re.sub` function in the `Anonymize` processor only partially anonymizes the credit card number or might not anonymize it at all if the spaces are in a way that breaks the regex matching logic.
    5. The log entry is written with the partially or fully unanonymized credit card number.
    6. If an attacker gains access to these logs, they can retrieve sensitive credit card information that was intended to be masked.
- Impact: Exposure of sensitive credit card numbers in application logs, potentially leading to financial fraud or identity theft if logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project implements the `Anonymize` processor in `kw/structlog_config/processors.py` which is intended to mask sensitive data based on regular expressions.
    - The `configure_structlog` function in `kw/structlog_config/config.py` allows users to include the `Anonymize` processor in their structlog configuration.
    - Example usage and configuration of the `Anonymize` processor are provided in the `README.md` file.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The regular expression `r"\d+(\d{4})"` used for credit card number anonymization is not robust enough to handle variations in credit card number formatting, such as the inclusion of spaces or hyphens.
    - Missing a more comprehensive and robust regular expression or algorithm for credit card number detection and anonymization that can handle different formats, including those with spaces, hyphens, and other separators.
    - Consider using well-established regular expression patterns for credit card numbers or a dedicated library for data masking that is specifically designed to handle sensitive financial data.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be configured to use the `Anonymize` processor with the vulnerable credit card number regex.
    - Credit card numbers, potentially with spaces or other separators, must be logged under keys that are targeted by the `Anonymize` processor's configuration (e.g., keys like "visa", "amex", "card_number").
    - An attacker must gain access to the application's logs to exploit this vulnerability.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/kw/structlog_config/processors.py`
    - Class: `Anonymize`
    - Method: `__call__`
    - The `Anonymize` processor iterates through the keys in the `event_dict` and checks if they are in the configured `self.patterns`.
    - For credit card number anonymization, the pattern is defined as `r"\d+(\d{4})"`. This regex looks for one or more digits `\d+` followed by capturing last four digits `(\d{4})`.
    - The `re.sub(pattern, replacement, event_dict[key])` function is used to replace the matched part of the string with the replacement string, which is `"*"` * 12 + r"\1" (twelve asterisks followed by the captured last four digits).
    - **Vulnerability:** If a credit card number contains spaces, like "4321 0000 8888 1234", the regex `r"\d+(\d{4})"` will not match the entire number as a single contiguous sequence of digits due to the spaces. It might match only the last group of digits after spaces or a partial sequence.
    - **Example:** With input "4321 0000 8888 1234", the regex might only match "1234" at the end or a larger digit sequence ending in "1234" if backtracking occurs, but it's unlikely to cover the entire "4321 0000 8888 1234".  Even if it matches "88881234" at the end, replacing it results in "4321 0000 **** ************1234", still revealing "4321 0000".
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new test function in `/code/test/unit/test_processors.py` named `test_anonymize_credit_card_spaces`.
    2. Inside the test function, initialize the `Anonymize` processor with the credit card pattern:
       ```python
       anonymize = uut.Anonymize(patterns=[
           ({"card_number"}, r"\d+(\d{4})", "*" * 12 + r"\1"),
       ])
       ```
    3. Create an event dictionary containing a credit card number with spaces:
       ```python
       event_dict = {"card_number": "4321 0000 8888 1234"}
       ```
    4. Apply the `anonymize` processor to the event dictionary:
       ```python
       result = anonymize(None, None, event_dict)
       ```
    5. Assert that the anonymization is insufficient and the credit card number is not fully masked. For example, check if the output still starts with the unmasked prefix "4321":
       ```python
       assert result["card_number"].startswith("4321")
       ```
    6. Run the test using `pytest /code/test/unit/test_processors.py::test_anonymize_credit_card_spaces`.
    7. Observe that the test passes, confirming the vulnerability as the assertion will be true, indicating that the credit card number with spaces is not properly anonymized.
