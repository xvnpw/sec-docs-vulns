### Vulnerability list:

- Vulnerability name: Unsanitized Table and Namespace Names in Avro Schema Generation
- Description: The `get_avro_schema` function directly incorporates the provided `table_name` and `namespace` parameters into the generated Avro schema without any sanitization. If an attacker can control these parameters, they can inject arbitrary strings into the Avro schema's `name` and `namespace` fields.
- Impact: Malformed Avro schemas can be generated, potentially causing issues in systems consuming them. Depending on the consuming system's implementation, this could lead to data processing errors, schema validation failures, or even security vulnerabilities in downstream applications if they improperly handle unexpected schema names or namespaces.
- Vulnerability rank: medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations: Input sanitization for `table_name` and `namespace` parameters in the `get_avro_schema` function. Implement sanitization to ensure that `table_name` and `namespace` only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens, or any other allowed characters based on Avro schema naming conventions.
- Preconditions: An attacker needs to be able to control the `table_name` and `namespace` parameters passed to the `get_avro_schema` function. This is likely to occur if the table and namespace are derived from user inputs or external, untrusted sources.
- Source code analysis:
  - In `/code/pg2avro/pg2avro.py`, the `get_avro_schema` function takes `table_name` and `namespace` as arguments.
  - These arguments are directly used to construct the `avro_schema` dictionary:
    ```python
    avro_schema = {
        "namespace": namespace,
        "name": table_name,
        "type": "record",
        "fields": [],
    }
    ```
  - There is no sanitization or validation performed on `table_name` and `namespace` before they are used in the schema.
  - An attacker can provide malicious strings as `table_name` and `namespace`.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Call `get_avro_schema` with a malicious `table_name` and `namespace` containing special characters, for example: `table_name="</script><svg/onload=alert(1)>"`, `namespace="</script><svg/onload=alert(2)>"`.
  - Step 2: Inspect the generated Avro schema (e.g., by printing the output of `get_avro_schema`).
  - Step 3: Verify that the malicious strings are directly embedded in the `name` and `namespace` fields of the Avro schema in the output.

- Vulnerability name: Unsanitized Column Names in Avro Schema Generation
- Description: The `get_avro_schema` function also incorporates column names directly from the input `columns` list into the generated Avro schema without sanitization. If an attacker can control the column names, they can inject arbitrary strings into the `name` field of each field within the Avro schema.
- Impact: Malformed Avro schemas with potentially malicious or unexpected column names can be generated, leading to problems in systems consuming these schemas. This could manifest as data processing errors, schema validation failures, or security issues in downstream applications if they rely on specific column names or fail to handle unexpected names properly.
- Vulnerability rank: medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations: Input sanitization for column names extracted from the `columns` input in the `get_avro_schema` function. Implement sanitization to ensure that column names only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens, or any other allowed characters based on Avro schema naming conventions.
- Preconditions: An attacker needs to be able to control the column names that are processed by the `get_avro_schema` function. This could happen if column names are read from a database where an attacker has injection capabilities, or if the application directly uses unsanitized user input to define column names.
- Source code analysis:
  - In `/code/pg2avro/pg2avro.py`, the `get_avro_schema` function iterates through the `columns` input.
  - For each column, it extracts the column name using `column.name`.
  - This `column.name` is directly used to construct the `field` dictionary:
    ```python
    field = {"name": column.name, "type": _get_avro_type(column, mapping_overrides)}
    avro_schema["fields"].append(field)
    ```
  - There is no sanitization or validation performed on `column.name` before it is used in the schema.
  - An attacker can provide malicious strings as column names in the `columns` input.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Call `get_avro_schema` with a list of columns where one or more column names are malicious strings, for example: `columns=[{"name": "</script><svg/onload=alert(3)>", "type": "int"}]`.
  - Step 2: Inspect the generated Avro schema (e.g., by printing the output of `get_avro_schema`).
  - Step 3: Verify that the malicious column names are directly embedded in the `fields` array of the Avro schema in the output.
