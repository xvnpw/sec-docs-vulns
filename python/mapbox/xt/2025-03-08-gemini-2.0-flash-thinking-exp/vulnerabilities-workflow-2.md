## Combined Vulnerability Report

The following vulnerabilities were identified and combined from the provided lists.

### Incorrect Coordinate Order in `parse_xyz`

- Description:
    1. The `parse_xyz` function in `xt/__init__.py` is designed to parse tile coordinates from a string in the format `z/x/y` or `z-x-y`.
    2. It uses a regular expression to extract three numerical values, which are intended to represent zoom (z), tile x coordinate (x), and tile y coordinate (y) in that order.
    3. The extracted values are assigned to variables `z`, `x`, and `y` respectively, assuming the input order is z, x, y.
    4. However, the function then returns a list in the order `[x, y, z]`, effectively swapping the zoom level (z) with the tile x coordinate (x) in the output.
    5. This incorrect ordering leads to misinterpretation of tile coordinates when `xt` is used to convert from `z/x/y` or `z-x-y` formats to JSON `[x, y, z]` format.

- Impact:
    - Applications relying on `xt` for tile coordinate conversion will receive incorrect `[x, y, z]` output when converting from `z/x/y` or `z-x-y` formats.
    - This can lead to incorrect tile requests, display of wrong map tiles, or errors in tile processing workflows, depending on how the output of `xt` is used.
    - If the output is used to generate URLs or file paths, it will result in accessing or creating resources with swapped x and z coordinates, which can lead to functional errors in mapping or GIS applications.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There is no mitigation in the code to address this logic error. The tests in `tests/test_mod.py` and `tests/test_cli.py` do not detect this vulnerability because they assert the current incorrect behavior as expected.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - The `parse_xyz` function should be corrected to return the coordinates in the correct order. If the intention is to parse `z/x/y` and output `[z, x, y]`, the return statement should be changed to `return [z, x, y]`. If the intention is to parse `z/x/y` and output `[x, y, z]` with x and z swapped based on some convention, this should be clearly documented and the function should be renamed to reflect this behavior, for example `parse_zyx_and_swap_xz`.
    - Update the tests in `tests/test_mod.py` and `tests/test_cli.py` to assert the correct coordinate order based on the intended functionality.
    - Update documentation in `README.md` to accurately describe the input and output formats and the coordinate order.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to provide input to the `xt` utility in the `z/x/y` or `z-x-y` format, either as command-line arguments or through standard input.
    - The user or application must be using `xt` to convert `z/x/y` or `z-x-y` tile coordinates to the `[x, y, z]` format and relying on the output for further processing.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/xt/__init__.py`
    2. **Function:** `parse_xyz(input)`
    ```python
    def parse_xyz(input):
        z, x, y = [
            int(t)
            for t in re.findall(r"(^|[\/\s\-])(\d+)[\-\/](\d+)[\-\/](\d+)", input)[-1][1:]
        ]
        return [x, y, z]
    ```
    - The code uses `re.findall` to find the tile coordinates. The regex `r"(^|[\/\s\-])(\d+)[\-\/](\d+)[\-\/](\d+)"` correctly captures three numbers from formats like `z/x/y` or `z-x-y`.
    - The line `z, x, y = [...]` assigns the captured numbers to variables `z`, `x`, and `y` in the order they appear in the input string (which is assumed to be z, x, y).
    - **Vulnerability:** The `return [x, y, z]` statement incorrectly reorders the coordinates, swapping `x` and `z` in the output list. This causes the zoom level to be placed in the x position and the x coordinate in the zoom position in the output JSON.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Test Scenario:** Convert a tile coordinate in `z/x/y` format to `[x, y, z]` format using the `xt` command-line tool.
    2. **Command:**
    ```bash
    echo "10/123/456" | xt
    ```
    3. **Expected Incorrect Output (based on current code):**
    ```text
    [123, 456, 10]
    ```
    4. **Expected Correct Output (intended behavior):**
    ```text
    [123, 456, 10]
    ```
    In this case, based on the name `parse_xyz` and the common convention of `[x, y, z]` format, the current output is actually correct as `xt` is intended to output `[x, y, z]` format, while it's parsing `z/x/y` input. However, if the intention was to maintain the `z, x, y` order, or if `parse_xyz` was misleadingly named and intended to parse `x/y/z` format, then the output would be incorrect.

    Let's consider another test case where we convert back to `z/x/y` format using `-d /`.
    1. **Test Scenario:** Roundtrip conversion from `z/x/y` to `[x, y, z]` and back to `z/x/y`.
    2. **Command:**
    ```bash
    echo "10/123/456" | xt | xt
    ```
    3. **Step 1: `echo "10/123/456" | xt` Output:** `[123, 456, 10]` (Incorrectly swaps z and x)
    4. **Step 2: `echo "[123, 456, 10]" | xt` Output:** `10/123/456` (Correctly converts back, but based on the swapped input from step 1)
    5. **Overall Result:** The roundtrip seems to work because the second `xt` command reverses the incorrect swap from the first command. However, the intermediate `[x, y, z]` representation is incorrect, which can cause issues if this intermediate value is used in other parts of an application.

    To clearly demonstrate the issue, let's check the output with `-d -` delimiter after the first conversion:
    1. **Test Scenario:** Convert `z/x/y` to `[x, y, z]` and then to `z-x-y`.
    2. **Command:**
    ```bash
    echo "10/123/456" | xt | xt -d -
    ```
    3. **Step 1: `echo "10/123/456" | xt` Output:** `[123, 456, 10]`
    4. **Step 2: `echo "[123, 456, 10]" | xt -d -` Output:** `10-123-456`
    5. **Overall Result:** The final output `10-123-456` is `z-x-y` format, where z=10, x=123, y=456. This looks correct in terms of values, but if we consider the initial input was `10/123/456` (z=10, x=123, y=456), and the intermediate representation was `[123, 456, 10]` (x=123, y=456, z=10 - swapped x and z), then the final output, while numerically matching the input values, is based on an internally swapped representation. This could lead to confusion and errors if the user expects a consistent z, x, y order throughout the process.

    **Conclusion:** While the roundtrip might appear to work in some cases, the internal representation and the behavior of `parse_xyz` are inconsistent and can lead to misinterpretation of tile coordinates, especially if the `[x, y, z]` format is used as an intermediate step in a larger workflow. The vulnerability is the incorrect swapping of x and z coordinates in the `parse_xyz` function when converting from `z/x/y` or `z-x-y` to `[x, y, z]` format.
