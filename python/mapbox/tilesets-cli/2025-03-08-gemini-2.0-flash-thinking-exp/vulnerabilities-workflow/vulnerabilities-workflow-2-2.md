- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `validate-source` command
- Description:
    1. A user executes the `tilesets validate-source` command, providing a file path as an argument.
    2. The `validate-source` command, through the `cligj.features_in_arg` decorator, attempts to open and read the file specified by the user-provided path.
    3. If the user provides a maliciously crafted file path, such as one starting with `../../`, the command will traverse directories outside of the intended working directory.
    4. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the local file system of the user running the `tilesets` command, as the file opening operation is performed without sufficient path sanitization. For example, an attacker could read sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` by providing the path `../../../../etc/passwd` as an argument to `validate-source`.
- Impact:
    - High: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the local file system where the `tilesets` command is executed. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, private keys, or other user data.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: There is no visible path sanitization or validation in the provided code snippets for the `validate-source` command. The command directly processes the path provided by the user.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The `validate-source` command should sanitize the input file path to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by:
        - Ensuring that the path is absolute and resolves within the intended working directory or a set of allowed directories.
        - Using functions that resolve paths safely, preventing traversal outside allowed directories (e.g., `os.path.abspath` and checking if it starts with an allowed base path).
        - Rejecting paths containing path traversal sequences like `../` or `..\\`.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into running the `tilesets validate-source` command with a malicious file path. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by convincing the user to process data from an untrusted source.
    - The user must have the `tilesets-cli` tool installed and configured.
    - The attacker must know or guess the path to the file they want to read on the user's system.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `mapbox_tilesets/scripts/cli.py`
    - Command: `validate_source`
    ```python
    @cli.command("validate-source")
    @cligj.features_in_arg
    def validate_source(features):
        """Validate your source file.
        $ tilesets validate-source <path/to/your/src/file>
        """
        click.echo("Validating features", err=True)

        for index, feature in enumerate(features):
            utils.validate_geojson(index, feature)

        click.echo("âœ” valid")
    ```
    - The `@cligj.features_in_arg` decorator is used for the `validate_source` command. This decorator is responsible for handling the input argument, which is expected to be a file path.
    - The code directly passes the path argument to `cligj.features_in_arg` without any sanitization.
    - `cligj.features_in_arg` (from external library `cligj`, not in provided files, but assumed based on context) likely opens the file path provided as a command-line argument. If a malicious path like `../../../../etc/passwd` is provided, `cligj.features_in_arg` will attempt to open this path directly, leading to path traversal.
    - The subsequent loop iterates through features and calls `utils.validate_geojson`, but this function is for GeoJSON validation and not related to path traversal.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure `mapbox-tilesets` CLI is installed and configured. Have a sensitive file accessible on the local file system, for example, `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows.
    2. **Craft a malicious path:** Create a path that traverses out of the expected directory to access the sensitive file. For example, if you are in your home directory, use `../../../../etc/passwd` (Linux) or `..\..\..\..\..\Windows\win.ini` (Windows).
    3. **Execute the `validate-source` command:** Run the command `tilesets validate-source ../../../../etc/passwd` (Linux) or `tilesets validate-source ..\..\..\..\..\Windows\win.ini` (Windows).
    4. **Observe the output:** If the vulnerability exists, the content of the sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`) will be printed to the standard output, or an error message indicating the file content could not be parsed as GeoJSON (but still attempting to open and read the file) will be shown. This confirms that the path traversal was successful and the tool attempted to read the targeted file.
    5. **Expected Result:** The content of `/etc/passwd` (or `C:\Windows\win.ini`) or error message implying file read should be displayed, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.
