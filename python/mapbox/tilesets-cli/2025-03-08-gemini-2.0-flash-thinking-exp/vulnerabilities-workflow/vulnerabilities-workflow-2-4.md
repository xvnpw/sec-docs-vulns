### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Improper handling of large coordinates in area estimation
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a GeoJSON file containing features with extremely large coordinate values (e.g., longitude and latitude values exceeding reasonable geographic bounds, like 1e18).
    2. The attacker uses the `tilesets estimate-area` command, providing the crafted GeoJSON file as input along with a specified precision level (e.g., 10m).
    3. The `tilesets estimate-area` command processes the GeoJSON file, using the `supermercado` library to calculate the tiled area based on the provided features and precision.
    4. Due to the extremely large coordinate values in the GeoJSON, the area calculation within `supermercado` or the underlying numerical computations might become unstable or produce incorrect results. This could lead to a miscalculation of the estimated area.
- Impact:
    - Incorrect area estimation for GeoJSON features with large coordinates.
    - This could lead to inaccurate reporting of tiled area, potentially impacting billing or resource allocation based on these estimations.
    - While not a direct code execution or data breach vulnerability, it undermines the reliability of the `estimate-area` command and could have financial implications if area estimations are used for billing purposes.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - GeoJSON validation is performed by default using `jsonschema` and `geojson.is_valid` in the `validate_geojson` and `geojson_validate` functions within `mapbox_tilesets/utils.py`.
    - This validation checks for basic GeoJSON structure and validity, but it does not include specific checks for the range or magnitude of coordinate values.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation to enforce reasonable ranges for coordinate values in GeoJSON inputs before processing them in the `estimate-area` command.
    - Implement range checks or bounds validation for longitude (e.g., -180 to +180) and latitude (e.g., -90 to +90) values.
    - Enhance error handling within the `calculate_tiles_area` function in `mapbox_tilesets/utils.py` to gracefully handle potential numerical issues arising from extreme coordinate values, possibly by clipping or normalizing coordinates to valid geographic ranges before area calculation, or by implementing checks for NaN or infinite values in intermediate calculations.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to the `tilesets` CLI tool and be able to execute the `estimate-area` command.
    - The optional `estimate-area` dependencies, including `supermercado`, must be installed for the command to function.
- Source code analysis:
    1. `mapbox_tilesets/scripts/cli.py`: The `estimate_area` command utilizes `cligj.features_in_arg` to process GeoJSON features from input files or stdin. It then calls `utils.calculate_tiles_area` to compute the area.
    2. `mapbox_tilesets/utils.py`: The `calculate_tiles_area` function uses the `supermercado.burntiles.burn` function to generate tiles and `_calculate_tile_area` to calculate the area of each tile.
    3. `_calculate_tile_area` performs area calculation using trigonometric functions (`np.sin`, `np.arctan`, `np.exp`) on tile coordinates, which are derived from the input feature coordinates. Extremely large coordinate values passed to these functions might lead to precision issues, overflow, or unexpected numerical results.
    4. The `validate_geojson` and `geojson_validate` functions in `mapbox_tilesets/utils.py` perform schema and GeoJSON validity checks, but these validations do not include checks on the magnitude or range of coordinate values within the GeoJSON geometries.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a GeoJSON file named `large_coords.geojson` with the following content:
    ```json
    {"type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
      {
        "type": "Feature",
        "geometry": {
          "type": "Point",
          "coordinates": [1e18, 1e18]
        },
        "properties": {}
      }
    ]
    }
    ```
    2. Open a terminal and execute the `estimate-area` command with the crafted GeoJSON file and 10m precision:
    ```bash
    tilesets estimate-area large_coords.geojson -p 10m
    ```
    3. Observe the output of the command. Check if the reported `km2` value is a reasonable geographic area or if it is an anomalously large number, zero, negative, or "NaN".
    4. Compare the output with the expected behavior when using a GeoJSON file with valid, geographically reasonable coordinates. If the area estimation is significantly skewed or results in an error, it confirms the vulnerability related to improper handling of large coordinates.
    5. (Optional) Repeat the test with different precision levels (e.g., 1m, 30cm, 1cm) and with the `--no-validation` flag to verify that the validation is not preventing the issue and that the problem lies within the area calculation logic when handling extreme coordinates.
