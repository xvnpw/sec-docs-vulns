### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via PATH argument
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can use the `rio glui` command-line tool and provide a malicious URL as the `PATH` argument instead of a local file path. For example: `rio glui http://malicious.example.com/internal/resource.tif`.
    2. The `rio-glui` application, running on the server, takes this user-provided URL and passes it as `src_path` to the `RasterTiles` class constructor in `rio_glui/raster.py`.
    3. Inside the `RasterTiles` constructor, the application uses the `rasterio.open(src_path)` function. This function interprets the provided `src_path` and if it's a URL, attempts to make an HTTP request to the specified URL from the server where `rio-glui` is running.
    4. If the provided URL points to an internal resource within the server's network (e.g., `http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data`, `http://localhost/admin`) or an external service that the server should not access, `rasterio.open()` will inadvertently initiate a request to that resource.
    5. The response from the internal resource or external service will be fetched by the server and processed by `rio-glui`. This can lead to information disclosure if the attacker can observe the application's behavior, logs, or if the application reflects parts of the response back to the attacker. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the internal resource, it could enable further attacks or misconfigurations. For instance, an attacker could probe for open ports on internal services, access cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` on AWS), or interact with internal APIs.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially bypass firewalls and access controls to read sensitive data from internal services that are not intended for public access. This can include configuration files, internal documentation, or data from internal applications and databases. Access to cloud metadata endpoints can expose sensitive cloud instance configurations and credentials.
    - **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can leverage the `rio-glui` server as a proxy to scan internal networks. By providing a range of internal IP addresses and ports in the `PATH` argument, they can probe for open ports and identify running services, gaining valuable insights into the internal network infrastructure and potential attack vectors.
    - **Access to Internal Services & Potential for Further Exploitation:** Attackers can interact with internal services that are not exposed to the public internet. If these internal services have vulnerabilities or lack proper authentication, the SSRF vulnerability can be a stepping stone for further exploitation. This could include accessing internal administration panels, manipulating internal applications, or triggering actions on internal services, potentially leading to data modification, service disruption, or unauthorized control over internal systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application directly passes the user-provided `PATH` argument to the `rasterio.open()` function without any validation, sanitization, or restrictions on URL schemes or destinations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation for the `PATH` argument within the `glui` command-line tool to ensure it is safe and expected. This should include:
        - **URL Scheme Whitelisting:** Restrict the allowed URL schemes to a predefined whitelist of safe and intended protocols. For example, if only local files and specific cloud storage like S3 are intended, only `file://` and `s3://` (and potentially `http://` and `https://` for trusted external COGs) should be permitted, explicitly disallowing other schemes like `gopher://`, `ftp://`, etc.
        - **Domain Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or a blacklist of disallowed domains for remote URLs. If the application is intended to access only specific external resources, enforce a whitelist of approved hostnames. For internal deployments, consider restricting access to only local file paths or trusted S3 buckets.
        - **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the URL path to prevent directory traversal or other path manipulation attacks, especially if local file paths are intended to be supported.
    - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the `rio-glui` application server from sensitive internal networks. This architectural mitigation limits the potential impact of an SSRF attack by restricting the application's network access to only the necessary external resources and preventing access to internal services.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure the server running `rio-glui` with the minimum necessary network permissions. Restrict its ability to initiate connections to internal networks and services, limiting the scope of potential SSRF exploitation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `rio glui` command-line tool must be accessible to the attacker. This could be through direct command-line access if the attacker has compromised a server running `rio-glui`, or indirectly if the `rio-glui` functionality is exposed through a web interface or API that allows users to specify the `PATH` argument.
    - The server running `rio-glui` must have network connectivity to the internal resources or external services that the attacker intends to target. If network segmentation is in place, the effectiveness of the SSRF will be limited to the resources accessible from the `rio-glui` server's network segment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/rio_glui/scripts/cli.py`**:
       - **Function: `glui`**: This function serves as the entry point for the `rio glui` command-line tool.
       - The `@click.argument("path", type=str)` decorator defines `path` as a command-line argument of type string.
       - The `path` argument is directly taken from user input without any sanitization or validation related to SSRF prevention.
       - The `glui` function instantiates the `RasterTiles` class, passing the user-provided `path` as the `src_path` argument:
         ```python
         @click.command()
         @click.argument("path", type=str)
         ...
         def glui(path, ...):
             """Rasterio glui cli."""
             ...
             raster = RasterTiles(path, indexes=bidx, tiles_size=tiles_dimensions, nodata=nodata)
             ...
         ```

    2. **File: `/code/rio_glui/raster.py`**:
       - **Class: `RasterTiles`**: This class is responsible for handling raster tile data.
       - **Constructor: `__init__(self, src_path, ...)`**: The constructor takes `src_path` as an argument, which originates from the user-controlled `path` command-line argument.
       - **Vulnerable Line**: Inside the `__init__` method, `rasterio.open(src_path)` is called directly with the user-provided `src_path`.
         ```python
         class RasterTiles(object):
             def __init__(self, src_path, indexes=None, tiles_size=512, nodata=None):
                 self.path = src_path
                 self.tiles_size = tiles_size
                 with rasterio.open(src_path) as src: # Potential SSRF vulnerability here
                     try:
                         assert src.driver == "GTiff"
                         assert src.is_tiled
                         assert src.overviews(1)
                     except (AttributeError, AssertionError, KeyError):
                         raise Exception(
                             "{} is not a valid CloudOptimized Geotiff".format(src_path)
                         )
                         ...
         ```
       - `rasterio.open()` is known to support URLs as input, allowing it to open remote raster datasets. However, in this code, there is no validation or restriction on the type or destination of the `src_path`, making it vulnerable to SSRF if a user provides a malicious URL.
       - **Visualization of Data Flow:**

         graph LR
             A[User Input (PATH)] --> B(rio_glui CLI);
             B --> C[RasterTiles Constructor (raster.py)];
             C --> D{rasterio.open(src_path)};
             D -- Malicious URL --> E[Target Resource (Internal/External)];
             E --> D;
             D --> F[rio-glui Application];
             F --> G[Attacker (Potential Information Leak)];
         ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy an instance of `rio-glui` that is accessible to the attacker. This could be a publicly accessible server or a server within a network the attacker can access. Let's assume the `rio-glui` server's IP address is `rio-glui-server-ip`.
        - Set up a simple HTTP server on an attacker-controlled machine (e.g., `attacker-server-ip`) to listen for incoming requests. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server: `python -m http.server 8000`. This server will log incoming requests.

    2. **Craft Malicious URL:** On the attacker's machine, determine its IP address (`attacker-server-ip`). Construct a malicious URL that points to the attacker's HTTP server, for example: `http://attacker-server-ip:8000/ssrf-test-rio-glui`.

    3. **Execute `rio glui` Command:** From a terminal or a system where you can execute `rio glui` commands (potentially on the `rio-glui` server itself or from a machine that can send commands to it), run the `rio glui` command, providing the crafted malicious URL as the `PATH` argument:
        ```sh
        rio glui http://attacker-server-ip:8000/ssrf-test-rio-glui
        ```

    4. **Observe Attacker Server Logs:** Check the logs of the attacker's HTTP server (the server started in step 1). You should observe a new incoming HTTP request. The source IP address of this request should be the IP address of the `rio-glui` server (`rio-glui-server-ip`), and the requested path should be `/ssrf-test-rio-glui` (or whatever path you specified in the malicious URL). This confirms that the `rio-glui` server initiated an outbound HTTP request to the attacker-controlled server based on the user-provided `PATH`, demonstrating the SSRF vulnerability.

    5. **Test Internal Resource Access (Optional):** To further demonstrate the potential to access internal resources, if you have access to an internal network reachable by the `rio-glui` server, identify an internal service (e.g., an internal web server at `http://internal-service-ip:8080`).  Execute `rio glui` with a URL pointing to this internal resource:
        ```sh
        rio glui http://internal-service-ip:8080/
        ```
        Monitor network traffic from the `rio-glui` server or check logs of the internal service (if possible) to verify if a request was made to the internal resource from the `rio-glui` server. Successful access to the internal resource (even if `rio-glui` fails to process it as a valid GeoTIFF) further confirms the SSRF vulnerability and its potential to reach internal systems.
