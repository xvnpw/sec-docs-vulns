### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via PATH argument
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can use the `rio glui` command-line tool and provide a malicious URL as the `PATH` argument.
    2. The `rio-glui` application, running on the server, takes this URL and passes it to the `RasterTiles` constructor.
    3. Inside the `RasterTiles` constructor, the application uses `rasterio.open()` to open the resource specified by the provided URL.
    4. If the URL points to an internal resource (e.g., an internal web server, cloud metadata endpoint, or other internal service), `rasterio.open()` will make a request to that internal resource from the server where `rio-glui` is running.
    5. The response from the internal resource will be processed by `rio-glui`, potentially exposing sensitive information to the attacker if they can observe the application's behavior or if the application returns parts of the response in its output or logs. In more severe cases, depending on the internal resource, this could lead to further exploitation.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information from internal resources that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This could include configuration files, internal documentation, or data from internal services.
    - **Internal Network Scanning:** The attacker could use the `rio-glui` application as a proxy to scan internal network ports and identify running services, gaining valuable information about the internal network infrastructure.
    - **Potential for Further Exploitation:** If the targeted internal resource has vulnerabilities, the SSRF vulnerability in `rio-glui` could be used to pivot and further exploit those internal vulnerabilities. For example, accessing an internal application's administration panel or triggering actions on internal services.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application directly uses the user-provided PATH argument with `rasterio.open()` without any validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation of the `PATH` argument. This could include:
        - **URL Scheme Whitelisting:** Only allow specific URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`, `s3`) and explicitly disallow others (e.g., `file`, `gopher`).
        - **Domain Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or a blacklist of disallowed domains for remote URLs. For internal deployments, consider only allowing local file paths and S3 URLs to trusted buckets.
        - **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the URL path to prevent directory traversal or other path-based attacks if local file paths are intended to be supported.
    - **Network Segmentation:** Deploy the `rio-glui` application in a network segment that is isolated from sensitive internal resources. This would limit the potential impact of an SSRF attack by restricting the application's access to internal services.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the server running `rio-glui` has minimal necessary permissions. Restrict its network access to only the resources it absolutely needs to function.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `rio_glui` application must be accessible to the attacker, either publicly over the internet or through a network the attacker has access to.
    - The server running `rio-glui` must have network connectivity to internal resources that the attacker wishes to target.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`rio_glui/scripts/cli.py:glui` function:**
       ```python
       @click.command()
       @click.argument("path", type=str)
       ...
       def glui(
           path,
           ...
       ):
           """Rasterio glui cli."""
           ...
           raster = RasterTiles(path, indexes=bidx, tiles_size=tiles_dimensions, nodata=nodata)
           ...
           app = server.TileServer(raster, ...)
           ...
           app.start()
       ```
       - The `glui` function takes the `path` argument directly from user input.
       - This `path` is passed without any validation to the `RasterTiles` constructor.

    2. **`rio_glui/raster.py:RasterTiles.__init__` method:**
       ```python
       class RasterTiles(object):
           ...
           def __init__(self, src_path, indexes=None, tiles_size=512, nodata=None):
               """Initialize RasterTiles object."""
               self.path = src_path
               self.tiles_size = tiles_size
               with rasterio.open(src_path) as src: # Potential SSRF
                   try:
                       assert src.driver == "GTiff"
                       assert src.is_tiled
                       assert src.overviews(1)
                   except (AttributeError, AssertionError, KeyError):
                       raise Exception(
                           "{} is not a valid CloudOptimized Geotiff".format(src_path)
                       )
                   ...
       ```
       - The `RasterTiles` constructor takes `src_path` (which is the user-provided `path`).
       - `rasterio.open(src_path)` is called directly with the user-provided path.
       - `rasterio.open()` is known to support URLs, including those pointing to internal resources.
       - **Visualization:**

       ```mermaid
       graph LR
           A[User Input: PATH Argument] --> B(rio_glui CLI);
           B --> C[RasterTiles Constructor];
           C --> D{rasterio.open(PATH)};
           D -- Malicious URL --> E[Internal Resource];
           E --> D;
           D --> F[rio-glui Application];
           F --> G[Attacker (Potential Info Leak)];
       ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** On an attacker-controlled machine, set up a simple HTTP listener (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`). For example, using `python -m http.server 8000` will start a web server on port 8000 serving files from the current directory.

    2. **Craft Malicious URL:** Determine the IP address or hostname of the attacker's server (e.g., `attacker-ip`). Construct a malicious URL pointing to the attacker's server, for example: `http://attacker-ip:8000/ssrf_test`.

    3. **Execute `rio glui` with Malicious URL:** On the machine running `rio-glui`, execute the command, replacing `<malicious_url>` with the crafted URL:
       ```sh
       rio glui <malicious_url>
       ```
       For example:
       ```sh
       rio glui http://attacker-ip:8000/ssrf_test
       ```

    4. **Observe Attacker Server Logs:** Check the logs of the attacker's HTTP server. You should see an incoming HTTP request originating from the `rio-glui` server. The request will be for the path specified in the malicious URL (`/ssrf_test` in this example). This confirms that the `rio-glui` application is making an outbound request to the attacker-controlled server based on the user-provided PATH argument, demonstrating SSRF.

    5. **Test Internal SSRF (Optional, if applicable):** If you have access to an internal network and know of an internal resource (e.g., `http://internal-service:8080/`), try to target it using `rio glui`:
       ```sh
       rio glui http://internal-service:8080/
       ```
       Monitor network traffic from the `rio-glui` server or check logs of the internal service (if possible) to verify if the request was made to the internal resource. Note that direct response observation might not be possible depending on network configuration and internal resource behavior, but evidence of the request being initiated from the `rio-glui` server is sufficient to confirm the SSRF vulnerability.
