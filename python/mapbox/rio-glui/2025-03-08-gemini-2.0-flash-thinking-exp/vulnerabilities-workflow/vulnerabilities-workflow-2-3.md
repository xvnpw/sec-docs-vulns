- Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Description:
  1. An attacker can provide a malicious URL as the `PATH` argument to the `rio glui` command.
  2. The `rio-glui` application uses the provided `PATH` to directly initiate a request using `rasterio.open()` in the `RasterTiles` class.
  3. If the provided `PATH` is a URL pointing to an internal resource (e.g., `http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data`), the server running `rio-glui` will make a request to that internal resource.
  4. The attacker can potentially gain access to resources or data that are accessible to the server but not directly to the attacker.
- Impact:
  - An attacker could potentially bypass firewalls or access controls to interact with internal services or retrieve sensitive data from internal network resources.
  - Depending on the internal services accessible, the attacker might be able to perform further attacks, such as reading internal configuration files, accessing databases, or interacting with other internal applications.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The application directly uses the user-provided path without any validation or sanitization to prevent SSRF.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation: Implement validation on the `PATH` argument to ensure it is a safe and expected resource. For example, if only publicly accessible COGs are intended, the input should be checked against a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns.
  - URL Whitelisting: Restrict the allowed URLs to a predefined whitelist of trusted sources.
  - Network segmentation:  Isolate the `rio-glui` application from sensitive internal networks if possible.
  - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the server running `rio-glui` has minimal necessary permissions to access only required resources and not the entire internal network.
- Preconditions:
  - The `rio-glui` application must be running and accessible to the attacker, either publicly or within a network the attacker has access to.
  - The server running `rio-glui` must have network access to internal resources that the attacker wants to target.
- Source code analysis:
  1. **`rio_glui/scripts/cli.py`**:
     - The `glui` function is the entry point for the command-line interface.
     - It takes the `path` argument directly from user input without any sanitization or validation related to SSRF.
     - It creates a `RasterTiles` object using the provided `path`: `raster = RasterTiles(path, ...)`
     - Then, it initializes `TileServer` with this `RasterTiles` object: `app = server.TileServer(raster, ...)`

  2. **`rio_glui/raster.py`**:
     - In the `RasterTiles` class, the `__init__` method takes `src_path` as an argument.
     - It directly uses `rasterio.open(src_path)` to open the raster dataset.
     - `rasterio.open()` supports URLs as `src_path`, which is the root cause of the SSRF vulnerability.
     ```python
     class RasterTiles(object):
         def __init__(self, src_path, indexes=None, tiles_size=512, nodata=None):
             """Initialize RasterTiles object."""
             self.path = src_path
             self.tiles_size = tiles_size
             with rasterio.open(src_path) as src: # Potential SSRF here
                 try:
                     assert src.driver == "GTiff"
                     assert src.is_tiled
                     assert src.overviews(1)
                 except (AttributeError, AssertionError, KeyError):
                     raise Exception(
                         "{} is not a valid CloudOptimized Geotiff".format(src_path)
                     )
                     ...
     ```
     - The code checks if the file is a valid CloudOptimized Geotiff but does not validate the source of the path (local file or remote URL) or sanitize the URL.

  3. **`rio_glui/server.py`**:
     - The `TileServer` class and `RasterTileHandler` class use the `RasterTiles` object to serve tiles.
     - The vulnerability is in the initial step of opening the raster dataset in `rio_glui/raster.py`, which is then used throughout the application.

- Security test case:
  1. Setup:
     - Deploy a `rio-glui` instance that is publicly accessible or accessible within a test network. Let's assume it's accessible at `http://example.com`.
     - Set up a simple HTTP server on an internal network (not directly accessible from the public internet but accessible to the `rio-glui` server). This internal server will serve a dummy file at `http://internal.example.com/test.txt`. This file can contain sensitive-looking data like "This is internal data."
  2. Attack:
     - As an attacker, use the `rio glui` command-line tool, providing the URL of the internal resource as the `PATH` argument:
       ```sh
       rio glui http://internal.example.com/test.txt
       ```
     - Access the `rio-glui` web interface served by `example.com`. For example, open `http://example.com/index.html` in a browser.
  3. Verification:
     - Observe the behavior of `rio-glui`. If the application attempts to fetch and process `http://internal.example.com/test.txt`, this indicates an SSRF vulnerability.
     - Check the logs of the internal HTTP server. If there is an incoming request from the `rio-glui` server's IP address for `/test.txt`, it confirms that the SSRF is occurring.
     - In a real attack scenario, instead of `test.txt`, an attacker could try to access internal services, metadata endpoints of cloud providers (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`), or other sensitive internal URLs.

This analysis confirms the presence of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in `rio-glui`. The application directly uses user-provided paths, including URLs, in `rasterio.open()` without validation, allowing an attacker to potentially make the server access internal resources.
