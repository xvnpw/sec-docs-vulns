### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `rio alpha` command
- Description:
    1. An attacker can supply a malicious `SRC_PATH` argument to the `rio alpha` command.
    2. The `rio alpha` command uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `SRC_PATH`, which only checks if the path exists but doesn't prevent path traversal.
    3. By crafting a path like `../../../sensitive_file.tif`, an attacker can potentially access files outside the intended input directory.
    4. The `rasterio.open(src_path)` function will then open the file specified by the attacker's path.
    5. The `rio alpha` command will process this file and write the output to the `DST_PATH`.
- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system where the `rio alpha` command is executed. This could include sensitive configuration files, data files, or other resources that the application user has access to.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `click.Path(exists=True)` is used for `SRC_PATH` which verifies that the input path exists, but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path sanitization to prevent path traversal. This could involve:
        - Using absolute paths and validating that the provided path is within an allowed directory.
        - Using functions to canonicalize paths and remove `..` components.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `rio alpha` command with arbitrary arguments.
    - The application user running `rio alpha` must have read permissions to the target file the attacker is trying to access via path traversal.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/rio_alpha/scripts/cli.py`
    - Function: `alpha`
    ```python
    @click.command("alpha")
    @click.argument("src_path", type=click.Path(exists=True))
    @click.argument("dst_path", type=click.Path(exists=False))
    ...
    def alpha(ctx, src_path, dst_path, ndv, creation_options, workers):
        """Adds/replaced an alpha band to your RGB or RGBA image
        ...
        """
        with rio.open(src_path) as src: # Vulnerable line
            band_count = src.count
        ...
        add_alpha(src_path, dst_path, ndv, creation_options, workers)
    ```
    - The `rio.open(src_path)` function directly uses the `src_path` provided by the user without any sanitization. If `src_path` contains path traversal sequences like `../`, it will be interpreted by `rasterio.open` and can lead to accessing files outside the intended directory.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a sensitive file named `sensitive_data.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory with content "This is sensitive data.".
    2. Execute the `rio alpha` command with a crafted `SRC_PATH` pointing to the sensitive file using path traversal and a valid `DST_PATH` within a temporary directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/test_output
    rio alpha ../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt /tmp/test_output/output.tif
    ```
    3. If the command executes successfully without errors, it indicates that `rio alpha` was able to open and process the `sensitive_data.txt` file via path traversal.
    4. To further verify, check the output file `/tmp/test_output/output.tif`. While the content may not be directly readable as text, successful execution confirms the vulnerability as the tool processed a file outside of the intended directory due to path traversal.
    5. To make the output more verifiable, one could prepare a dummy tif file as `sensitive_data.tif` and check if the output `output.tif` is a valid tif, confirming successful processing of the traversed file.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `rio islossy` command
- Description:
    1. An attacker can supply a malicious `INPUT` argument to the `rio islossy` command.
    2. The `rio islossy` command uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `INPUT`, similar to `rio alpha`, which checks for existence but not traversal prevention.
    3. An attacker can craft a path like `../../../sensitive_config.json` to access sensitive files.
    4. `rasterio.open(input, "r")` will open the file specified by the attacker.
    5. The `rio islossy` command will then process this file to determine lossiness.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Similar to `rio alpha`, this allows reading arbitrary files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `click.Path(exists=True)` is used for `INPUT` which verifies that the input path exists, but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path sanitization to prevent path traversal, similar to `rio alpha`.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can execute `rio islossy` with arbitrary arguments.
    - Application user has read permissions to the target file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/rio_alpha/scripts/cli.py`
    - Function: `islossy`
    ```python
    @click.command("islossy")
    @click.argument("input", nargs=1, type=click.Path(exists=True))
    ...
    def islossy(input, ndv):
        """
        Determine if there are >= 10 nodata regions in an image
        If true, returns the string `--lossy lossy`.
        """
        with rio.open(input, "r") as src: # Vulnerable line
            img = src.read()
        ...
    ```
    - The `rio.open(input, "r")` line is vulnerable for the same reason as in `rio alpha`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a sensitive file `sensitive_config.json` in `/tmp/` with content `{"api_key": "SUPER_SECRET_KEY"}`.
    2. Execute `rio islossy` with a crafted `INPUT` path:
    ```bash
    rio islossy ../../../tmp/sensitive_config.json
    ```
    3. If the command executes without errors, it indicates successful path traversal. While `rio islossy` is designed for raster images, the underlying `rasterio.open` might still attempt to open and read any file. Successful execution is enough to confirm the path traversal vulnerability even if the tool later fails to process the non-image file.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `rio findnodata` command
- Description:
    1. An attacker can supply a malicious `src_path` argument to the `rio findnodata` command.
    2. Similar to the other commands, `rio findnodata` uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `src_path`.
    3. An attacker can use path traversal, e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`, to access system files.
    4. `rasterio.open(src_path, "r")` will attempt to open the file.
    5. `rio findnodata` will then try to determine the nodata value of this file.
- Impact:
    - **High**: Again, arbitrary file reading, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `click.Path(exists=True)` is used for `src_path` which verifies that the input path exists, but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path sanitization to prevent path traversal.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can execute `rio findnodata` with arbitrary arguments.
    - Application user has read permissions to the target file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/rio_alpha/scripts/cli.py`
    - Function: `findnodata`
    ```python
    @click.command("findnodata")
    @click.argument("src_path", type=click.Path(exists=True))
    ...
    def findnodata(src_path, user_nodata, discovery, debug, verbose):
        """Print a dataset's nodata value."""
        ndv = determine_nodata(src_path, user_nodata, discovery, debug, verbose)
        click.echo("%s" % ndv)
    ```
    - File: `/code/rio_alpha/findnodata.py`
    - Function: `determine_nodata`
    ```python
    def determine_nodata(src_path, user_nodata, discovery, debug, verbose):
        """Worker function for determining nodata
        ...
        """
        ...
        with rasterio.open(src_path, "r") as src: # Vulnerable line
            count = src.count
            ...
    ```
    - `rasterio.open(src_path, "r")` in `determine_nodata` is the vulnerable point.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file (or a similar sensitive file accessible to the user running the test).
    2. Execute `rio findnodata` with a crafted `src_path`:
    ```bash
    rio findnodata ../../../etc/passwd
    ```
    3. If the command executes without errors or throws a `RasterioIOError` but not a higher-level crash related to file access permissions before rasterio attempts to read raster data, it suggests that `rasterio.open` successfully opened the file, confirming path traversal. The output might be an empty string or an error message from `determine_nodata` if it can't process `/etc/passwd` as a raster, but successful execution up to the `rasterio.open` stage is sufficient to demonstrate the vulnerability.
