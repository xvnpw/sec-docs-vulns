### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection in `mason install` command via Package Name

- **Description**:
    - A threat actor can craft a malicious package name containing shell metacharacters.
    - When a user executes `mason install <package_name> <version>` with this malicious package name, the `mason install` script will use the unsanitized package name in a shell command.
    - This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the `mason` command.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Full system compromise is possible. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete system takeover.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The code does not sanitize package names or versions before using them in shell commands.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for package names and versions in the `mason install` command. This should include escaping or removing shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Commands**:  Instead of directly embedding user input into shell commands, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell scripting where possible. In bash, using arrays to build commands can help prevent injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: While not a direct code mitigation, running `mason` with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful command injection. However, this is a general security best practice and not a specific mitigation within the Mason project itself.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must execute the `mason install` command with a maliciously crafted package name or version.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection, which is typical for systems where bash scripts are executed without careful input sanitization.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - The `mason install` command likely uses string concatenation or similar methods to construct shell commands that include the package name and version.
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Review the `mason_install` function (if it exists, or the `install` command handling logic within `mason_run`) and trace how the `<package>` and `<version>` arguments are used.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        User Input (package_name) --> mason install script --> Command Construction (unsanitized package_name embedded) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```
    - **Example Scenario (Hypothetical code in `mason.sh`):**
        ```bash
        # Hypothetical vulnerable code in mason.sh
        install_package() {
          package_name="$1"
          package_version="$2"
          # Vulnerable command construction:
          command="mkdir -p ./mason_packages/$package_name/$package_version && curl -sSL http://malicious.repo.com/$package_name-$package_version.tar.gz | tar -xz -C ./mason_packages/$package_name/$package_version"
          eval "$command" # Command Injection vulnerability here
        }

        if [ "$1" == "install" ]; then
          install_package "$2" "$3" # $2 is package_name, $3 is package_version
        fi
        ```
        In this hypothetical example, if `$2` (package name) contains backticks, semicolons, or other shell command separators, it could lead to command injection via the `eval` command.

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Prepare a malicious package name: `malicious-package-\`touch /tmp/pwned\``
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason install` command with the malicious package name: `./mason/mason install malicious-package-\`touch /tmp/pwned\` 1.0.0`
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection.

### Vulnerability 2: Command Injection in `mason install` command via Package Version

- **Description**:
    - Similar to Vulnerability 1, but the threat actor crafts a malicious package version string containing shell metacharacters.
    - When a user executes `mason install <package_name> <version>` with this malicious version, the `mason install` script uses the unsanitized version in a shell command, leading to arbitrary command execution.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Same as Vulnerability 1. Full system compromise is possible.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Same as Vulnerability 1. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for package names and versions.
    - **Parameterized Queries/Commands**: Same as Vulnerability 1. Use safer alternatives to shell scripting.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must execute the `mason install` command with a maliciously crafted package version.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - Similar to Vulnerability 1, the `mason install` command is the entry point.
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Analyze the same code sections as in Vulnerability 1.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        User Input (package_version) --> mason install script --> Command Construction (unsanitized package_version embedded) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```
    - **Example Scenario (Hypothetical code in `mason.sh`):**
        ```bash
        # Hypothetical vulnerable code in mason.sh
        install_package() {
          package_name="$1"
          package_version="$2"
          # Vulnerable command construction:
          command="mkdir -p ./mason_packages/$package_name/$package_version && curl -sSL http://malicious.repo.com/$package_name-$package_version.tar.gz | tar -xz -C ./mason_packages/$package_name/$package_version"
          eval "$command" # Command Injection vulnerability here
        }

        if [ "$1" == "install" ]; then
          install_package "$2" "$3" # $2 is package_name, $3 is package_version
        fi
        ```
        In this hypothetical example, if `$3` (package version) contains shell command separators, it could also lead to command injection.

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Prepare a malicious package version: `1.0.0-\`touch /tmp/pwned2\``
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason install` command with the malicious package version: `./mason/mason install libuv 1.0.0-\`touch /tmp/pwned2\``
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned2` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection.

### Vulnerability 3: Command Injection in Package `script.sh` via MASON_VERSION or MASON_NAME

- **Description**:
    - A malicious package maintainer can create a `script.sh` that executes arbitrary commands due to unsafe use of `MASON_VERSION` or `MASON_NAME` variables, which are derived from user input to `mason install`.
    - When a user installs this malicious package, the `script.sh` will be executed, and the injected commands will run on the user's system.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical**. Same as Vulnerability 1 and 2. Full system compromise is possible.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Code Review for Package Scripts**: Implement a mechanism to review and potentially sign package scripts to ensure they are safe before users install them. This could involve a trusted repository of verified packages.
    - **Sandboxing Package Scripts**: Execute package scripts in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of malicious code.
    - **User Warnings**: Display clear warnings to users before executing package scripts, especially when installing packages from untrusted sources.

- **Preconditions**:
    - User must attempt to install a malicious package where the `script.sh` contains command injection vulnerabilities.
    - The user's system must be vulnerable to command injection.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - **File: `/code/mason.sh`**: Examine how `script.sh` files are executed, specifically the `mason_run` function and how it sources the package's `script.sh`.
    - **File: `/code/scripts/<package>/<version>/script.sh`**: Analyze example `script.sh` files to understand how `MASON_VERSION` and `MASON_NAME` are used within these scripts.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        Malicious Package Script (script.sh with injected commands via MASON_VERSION/NAME) --> mason install script --> Script Execution (unsanitized MASON_VERSION/NAME used in commands) --> Shell Execution --> Vulnerability
        ```
    - **Example Scenario (Malicious `script.sh`):**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        MASON_NAME=malicious-package
        # Malicious MASON_VERSION that injects commands
        MASON_VERSION='1.0.0; touch /tmp/pwned3'
        MASON_HEADER_ONLY=true

        . ${MASON_DIR}/mason.sh

        function mason_compile {
            # Unsafe use of MASON_VERSION
            echo "Package version is: ${MASON_VERSION}"
            # Command injection via MASON_VERSION
            eval "${MASON_VERSION}"
        }

        mason_run "$@"
        ```
        In this malicious `script.sh`, the `MASON_VERSION` is intentionally crafted to include `touch /tmp/pwned3`. When `mason_compile` is executed, `eval "${MASON_VERSION}"` will execute `touch /tmp/pwned3` in addition to the intended version string.

- **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Create a malicious package script (e.g., `scripts/malicious-package/0.0.0/script.sh`) with the content shown in the example scenario above.
    - **Step 2**: Execute the `mason build` command to simulate installation: `./mason/mason build malicious-package 0.0.0`
    - **Step 3**: Check for command execution: Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned3` was created. If the file exists, it confirms successful command injection via the malicious `script.sh`.
