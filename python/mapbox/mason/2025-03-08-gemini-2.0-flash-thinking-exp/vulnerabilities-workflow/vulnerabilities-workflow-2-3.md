### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Package
  - Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious package and uploads it to a location accessible by users (e.g., a fake package repository or a compromised package bucket).
    2. The malicious package includes a compromised `script.sh` file.
    3. A user, intending to install a package, unknowingly or knowingly targets the malicious package by specifying the package name and version to the `mason install` command.
    4. Mason downloads the package, including the malicious `script.sh`.
    5. During the installation process, Mason executes the `script.sh` file without any security checks or sanitization.
    6. The malicious code within `script.sh` is executed with the privileges of the user running the `mason install` command, potentially leading to full system compromise.
  - Impact: Critical
    - Full system compromise. An attacker can gain complete control over the user's machine by executing arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the `mason install` command. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, and complete system takeover.
  - Vulnerability Rank: critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
    - The project description and source code analysis indicate that there are no mitigations in place to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. Mason directly executes the `script.sh` without any sanitization or security checks.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The project lacks input sanitization for the `script.sh` file content before execution. Mason should validate the script content to prevent malicious commands from being executed.
    - Sandboxing/Containerization: Implement sandboxing or containerization to isolate the execution environment of `script.sh`. This would limit the impact of a compromised script by restricting its access to system resources.
    - Code Review and Signing: Introduce a code review process for package definitions, especially `script.sh`, and implement package signing to ensure authenticity and integrity. This would help users verify the source and trustworthiness of packages.
    - User Warnings: Display clear warnings to users about the risks of installing and executing packages from untrusted sources, especially highlighting the potential for arbitrary command execution from `script.sh`.
    - Trusted Repositories: Encourage or enforce the use of trusted package repositories to minimize the risk of users installing malicious packages.
  - Preconditions:
    - A user must execute the `mason install` command.
    - The user must specify a malicious package name and version, pointing to a repository controlled by the attacker or a compromised repository.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The `mason.sh` script is the main entry point for the Mason package manager.
    - The `mason_run` function in `mason.sh` handles different commands based on the first argument, including the `install` command.
    - When the `install` command is triggered, `mason_run` calls `mason_install` (which is actually `mason_run` itself with "install" as argument).
    - `mason_install` then calls `mason_build`.
    - `mason_build` proceeds to execute the following functions in sequence: `mason_load_source`, `mason_prepare_compile`, `mason_compile` and `mason_write_config`.
    - The `mason_load_source` function is responsible for downloading and extracting the package source code from a remote location. This includes downloading the `script.sh` file from the package definition.
    - The `mason_compile` function, which is intended to handle the compilation of the package, is actually overridden by the `script.sh` file within each package definition.
    - Mason directly executes the `script.sh` using `bash` without any form of sanitization, validation, or sandboxing.
    - The `mason_run "$@"` line at the end of each `script.sh` effectively executes the custom `mason_compile` function defined in the `script.sh`, which can contain arbitrary commands provided by the malicious package author.
    - There are no visible security checks or mitigations in `mason.sh` or the provided package scripts that would prevent arbitrary command execution.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a directory structure for a malicious package: `mkdir -p scripts/malicious/1.0.0`.
    2. Create a malicious `script.sh` file within the newly created directory: `scripts/malicious/1.0.0/script.sh`. The content of this file should be:
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] - Malicious script execution"
    touch /tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned
    ```
    3. Create a dummy `.travis.yml` file within the same directory: `scripts/malicious/1.0.0/.travis.yml`. The content can be empty or contain dummy Travis CI configuration.
    4. Execute the mason install command targeting the malicious package: `./mason/mason build malicious 1.0.0`.
    5. After the command execution, check for the existence of the file `/tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned`: `test -f /tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned && echo "Vulnerability confirmed: File '/tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned' created." || echo "Vulnerability test failed: File '/tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned' not found."`.
    6. If the file `/tmp/mason_vulnerability_test_pwned` exists, this confirms that the arbitrary command within the malicious `script.sh` was successfully executed by Mason, demonstrating the Arbitrary Command Execution vulnerability.
