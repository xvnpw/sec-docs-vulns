Based on the instructions and filtering criteria provided, let's evaluate the given vulnerability:

**Vulnerability: Integer Overflow in ZigZag Decoding leading to Coordinate Overflow**

* **Valid vulnerability and part of attack vector**: Yes, crafting a malicious vector tile to exploit the decoding logic is a valid attack vector for this library.
* **Only missing documentation to mitigate**: No, the described missing mitigations are code-level implementations like input validation and range limits, not just documentation.
* **Deny of service vulnerabilities**: No, while performance degradation is mentioned as a potential impact, the main impact is unexpected behavior and logical errors, not primarily a DoS.
* **Not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world**: No, crafting malicious vector tiles is a realistic attack scenario, especially if the library is used in systems processing external data.
* **Not completely described**: No, the vulnerability description is detailed, including source code analysis and a security test case.
* **Only theoretical**: No, the description is based on source code analysis and includes a test case to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* **Not high or critical severity**: Yes, the vulnerability is ranked as "Medium".  According to the instructions, vulnerabilities that are "not high or critical severity" should be excluded.

Based on the strict interpretation of the instruction "Exclude vulnerabilities that: ... are not high or critical severity", this vulnerability with "Medium" severity should be excluded.

Therefore, based on the provided criteria, and especially the severity constraint, the vulnerability should be excluded.

**Final Answer: Empty List**
