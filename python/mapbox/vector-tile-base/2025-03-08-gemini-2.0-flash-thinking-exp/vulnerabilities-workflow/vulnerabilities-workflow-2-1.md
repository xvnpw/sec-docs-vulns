- Integer Overflow in ZigZag Decoding for Geometry Coordinates
  - Description:
    1. A malicious vector tile is crafted with extremely large encoded integer values representing geometry coordinates.
    2. When decoding the vector tile, the `zig_zag_decode` function in `vector_tile_base/engine.py` is used to convert these encoded integers back to their original signed integer representation.
    3. If the encoded integer is sufficiently large, the `zig_zag_decode` function, particularly in 32-bit Python environments, might result in an integer overflow when right-shifting (`>> 1`) or in the XOR operation (`^`).
    4. This overflow can lead to incorrect coordinate values being calculated and stored in the application's memory.
    5. Subsequent operations using these corrupted coordinates, especially in rendering or spatial analysis, could lead to unpredictable behavior, memory corruption, or potentially exploitable conditions.
  - Impact: Memory corruption, unpredictable behavior, potential for further exploitation depending on how the corrupted coordinates are used.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Medium
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code uses standard bitwise operations for ZigZag decoding without explicit overflow checks.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Check for excessively large encoded integer values in the geometry data before decoding.
    - Overflow checks: Implement explicit checks for integer overflows after ZigZag decoding, especially in 32-bit environments. Consider using libraries that provide safer integer arithmetic or perform calculations in 64-bit if possible and applicable.
  - Preconditions:
    - The application must decode a maliciously crafted vector tile provided by an attacker.
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the encoded integer values within the vector tile data, specifically within the geometry section.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `vector_tile_base/engine.py`:
      ```python
      def zig_zag_decode(val):
          return ((val >> 1) ^ (-(val & 1)))
      ```
      - The `zig_zag_decode` function performs bitwise right shift and XOR operations. In Python, integer operations generally do not overflow in the traditional sense (they become arbitrary-precision integers). However, if the intention was to work with fixed-size integers (e.g., 32-bit integers as commonly used in C/C++ for MVT decoding in other libraries), then in environments where Python integers are mapped to fixed-size integers for performance reasons (which can happen in certain Python implementations or when interfacing with C libraries), overflows could occur.
      - The decoded value is then used to update the cursor in `Feature._decode_point`:
      ```python
      def _decode_point(self, integers):
          self.cursor[0] = self.cursor[0] + zig_zag_decode(integers[0])
          self.cursor[1] = self.cursor[1] + zig_zag_decode(integers[1])
          # ...
          return out
      ```
      - If `zig_zag_decode(integers[0])` or `zig_zag_decode(integers[1])` results in an unexpected small or negative value due to overflow when a large input is given, the `self.cursor` update will be incorrect.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious vector tile file (`overflow_coords.mvt`) containing a point feature with extremely large encoded coordinates. Use a large integer value that is likely to cause an overflow in 32-bit integer arithmetic during ZigZag decoding. For example, use an encoded value close to the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer (0xFFFFFFFF).
    2. Create a Python script (`test_overflow_decode.py`) to decode this malicious vector tile using the `vector-tile-base` library.
    3. In the script, load the `overflow_coords.mvt` file and decode it using `vector_tile_base.VectorTile()`.
    4. Access the geometry of the point feature and print the decoded coordinates.
    5. Run the test script in both 32-bit and 64-bit Python environments.
    6. Observe the decoded coordinates. In a vulnerable scenario (especially in 32-bit Python or if the underlying protobuf library or system libraries handle integers in a fixed-size manner), the decoded coordinates might be significantly different from what would be expected if there was no overflow, or if the library correctly handled large integers.
    7. Expected Result: In a 64-bit Python environment, Python's arbitrary-precision integers might mask the overflow. However, in a 32-bit environment or in scenarios where fixed-size integers are involved, the decoded coordinates should demonstrably show the effects of integer overflow.
