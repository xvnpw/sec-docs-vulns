- Vulnerability Name: Potential Heap Buffer Overflow in OpenCV Contour Processing

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious GeoJSON file containing an extremely large or complex geospatial feature.
    2. The attacker uses the `rs rasterize` tool to convert this malicious GeoJSON into a segmentation mask image. The large or complex feature in the GeoJSON is rasterized into a corresponding large or complex object in the mask image.
    3. The attacker then uses the `rs features` tool, specifying a feature type that utilizes OpenCV contour processing (e.g., "parking").
    4. The `rs features` tool loads the segmentation mask image generated in the previous step.
    5. Inside `rs features`, the `robosat.features.core.contours` function, which uses `cv2.findContours` from OpenCV, is called to extract contours from the segmentation mask.
    6. If the crafted GeoJSON and subsequent mask result in contours that are excessively large or complex, it could trigger an integer overflow or heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the underlying OpenCV `cv2.findContours` or related contour processing functions like `cv2.approxPolyDP` called within `robosat.features.core.simplify`.
    7. This memory corruption vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system running RoboSat.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the machine running RoboSat.
    - Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain complete control over the RoboSat instance and potentially the underlying system, leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files related to mitigating potential OpenCV vulnerabilities stemming from crafted GeoJSON inputs. The project relies on external libraries like OpenCV without specific input validation or size limitations to prevent exploitation of potential vulnerabilities within these libraries.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for GeoJSON files to limit the complexity and size of geospatial features before rasterization. This could include checks on the number of vertices in polygons, the overall size of the GeoJSON, and coordinate ranges.
    - Size limits on segmentation masks to prevent processing of excessively large images that could exacerbate potential buffer overflows during contour processing.
    - Error handling and resource limits within the contour processing pipeline to gracefully handle unexpectedly large or complex contours and prevent crashes or exploitable conditions.
    - Regular updates of the OpenCV library to the latest version to incorporate any security patches and vulnerability fixes.

- Preconditions:
    - RoboSat is installed and configured.
    - The attacker has the ability to supply a GeoJSON file to the `rs rasterize` or `rs features` tools, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a web interface if RoboSat is integrated into a web application).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`robosat/tools/features.py`**: This tool is the entry point for feature extraction. It takes a mask directory and feature type as input.
    ```python
    # File: /code/robosat/tools/features.py
    def main(args):
        dataset = load_config(args.dataset)
        labels = dataset["common"]["classes"]
        assert set(labels).issuperset(set(handlers.keys())), "handlers have a class label"
        index = labels.index(args.type)
        handler = handlers[args.type]() # e.g., ParkingHandler
        tiles = list(tiles_from_slippy_map(args.masks))
        for tile, path in tqdm(tiles, ascii=True, unit="mask"):
            image = np.array(Image.open(path).convert("P"), dtype=np.uint8)
            mask = (image == index).astype(np.uint8)
            handler.apply(tile, mask) # ParkingHandler.apply()
        handler.save(args.out)
    ```
    2. **`robosat/features/parking.py`**: The `ParkingHandler.apply` method performs contour extraction and simplification using functions from `robosat.features.core`.
    ```python
    # File: /code/robosat/features/parking.py
    class ParkingHandler:
        # ...
        def apply(self, tile, mask):
            # ...
            denoised = denoise(mask, self.kernel_size_denoise)
            grown = grow(denoised, self.kernel_size_grow)
            multipolygons, hierarchy = contours(grown) # Calls cv2.findContours
            if hierarchy is None:
                return
            # ...
            polygons = [simplify(polygon, self.simplify_threshold) for polygon in multipolygons] # Calls cv2.approxPolyDP
            # ...
    ```
    3. **`robosat/features/core.py`**: The `contours` and `simplify` functions directly call OpenCV functions that are potentially vulnerable.
    ```python
    # File: /code/robosat/features/core.py
    def contours(mask):
        contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # OpenCV function
        return contours, hierarchy

    def simplify(polygon, eps):
        epsilon = eps * cv2.arcLength(polygon, closed=True)
        return cv2.approxPolyDP(polygon, epsilon=epsilon, closed=True) # OpenCV function
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Point**: The `cv2.findContours` and `cv2.approxPolyDP` functions in OpenCV are written in C++ and could be vulnerable to memory corruption issues when handling extremely large or complex inputs. A malicious GeoJSON can be crafted to produce segmentation masks that lead to such inputs for these OpenCV functions.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft a Malicious GeoJSON:** Create a GeoJSON file (`malicious.geojson`) with a very large and complex polygon. This polygon should have a huge number of vertices and/or extreme coordinates, aiming to create a very large contour when rasterized. For example, a polygon approximating a filled circle with thousands of points.
    2. **Rasterize the Malicious GeoJSON:** Use the `rs rasterize` tool to rasterize the `malicious.geojson` file into a mask image.
    ```bash
    ./rs rasterize --dataset config/dataset-parking.toml --zoom 18 malicious.geojson tiles_mask
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to create a dummy `tiles.csv` file containing a tile coordinate that intersects with your malicious GeoJSON feature for `rs rasterize` to process it. For example, `tiles.csv` with content "69623,104946,18")*
    3. **Run Feature Extraction on the Mask:** Execute the `rs features` tool with the "parking" feature type on the generated mask directory (`tiles_mask`).
    ```bash
    ./rs features --dataset config/dataset-parking.toml --type parking tiles_mask output_features.geojson
    ```
    4. **Observe the Outcome:** Monitor the execution of `rs features`. A successful exploit might result in:
        - A crash of the `rs features` tool, potentially with a segmentation fault or other memory-related error.
        - Unexpected behavior or corruption of output files.
        - In a more advanced scenario, if the vulnerability is reliably exploitable, it might be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution.
    5. **Expected Result:** The test should ideally demonstrate a crash or abnormal termination of the `rs features` tool when processing the mask derived from the malicious GeoJSON, indicating a potential vulnerability in OpenCV contour processing. If a crash doesn't occur, further investigation might be needed to confirm or deny the vulnerability, potentially involving more sophisticated analysis of memory usage and program behavior during execution. If a crash with a memory error is observed, this confirms the vulnerability.
