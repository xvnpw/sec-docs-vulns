- Vulnerability Name: GeoJSON Parsing Vulnerability in `rs merge` and `rs dedupe`

- Description:
  The `rs merge` and `rs dedupe` tools in RoboSat parse GeoJSON files provided by users. These tools use the `geojson` library (and in `rs dedupe`, also `json.load` which is compatible with GeoJSON) to load GeoJSON data and `shapely` to process geometric shapes. If a maliciously crafted GeoJSON file is provided, it could exploit vulnerabilities in either the `geojson` parsing library, `json.load` or the `shapely` geometry processing library. Specifically, if these libraries fail to properly handle certain GeoJSON structures or properties, or if `shapely` encounters unexpected or invalid geometries within the GeoJSON, it could lead to unexpected behavior. This could range from parsing errors to more severe vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the underlying libraries and are triggered by specific GeoJSON structures.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious GeoJSON file. This file could contain excessively complex geometries, deeply nested structures, or invalid coordinate values that are not properly handled by the `geojson`, `json.load` and `shapely` libraries.
  2. The attacker uses the `rs merge` or `rs dedupe` command, providing the path to the malicious GeoJSON file as input. For example: `./rs merge malicious.geojson output.geojson` or `./rs dedupe osm.geojson malicious.geojson output_deduped.geojson`.
  3. RoboSat attempts to parse the malicious GeoJSON file using the `geojson.load()` or `json.load()` function and process geometries using `shapely.geometry.shape()`.
  4. If the crafted GeoJSON exploits a vulnerability in the parsing or geometry processing logic, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

- Impact:
  The impact of this vulnerability could range from data manipulation to, in a worst-case scenario, arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - **Data Manipulation**: Corrupt the processed geospatial data, leading to incorrect analysis or decisions based on the output of RoboSat.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution**: If a vulnerability in the underlying libraries (`geojson`, `shapely`, or dependencies) is triggered, it could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running RoboSat. This is the most severe potential impact, although it depends on the existence of exploitable vulnerabilities in the libraries used.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the project's code itself to specifically handle malicious GeoJSON inputs. The project relies on the security of the external `geojson` and `shapely` libraries.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust validation of the input GeoJSON files before parsing and processing. This should include checks for:
    - Schema validation: Ensure the GeoJSON structure conforms to expected standards.
    - Geometry validation: Validate the geometries for correctness, complexity limits, and potential issues like self-intersections or invalid coordinates before processing them with `shapely`.
    - Property validation: Sanitize or limit the properties within GeoJSON features to prevent injection attacks if properties are used in further processing (though not immediately evident in the provided code snippets, it's a general good practice).
  - **Library Updates and Vulnerability Monitoring**: Regularly update the `geojson` and `shapely` libraries to their latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for these libraries.
  - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: Consider running the GeoJSON parsing and processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GeoJSON file as input to the `rs merge` or `rs dedupe` tools. This is typically through the command-line argument.
  - The RoboSat application must be running and accessible to process the malicious GeoJSON file (e.g., a publicly accessible instance or an instance the attacker has access to).

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **`robosat/tools/merge.py`**:
     ```python
     import sys
     import argparse
     import geojson
     from tqdm import tqdm
     import shapely.geometry
     # ...
     def main(args):
         with open(args.features) as fp:
             collection = geojson.load(fp) # <-- GeoJSON input parsing here!
         shapes = [shapely.geometry.shape(feature["geometry"]) for feature in collection["features"]] # Shapely processing
         # ...
         collection = geojson.FeatureCollection(features)
         with open(args.out, "w") as fp:
             geojson.dump(collection, fp) # GeoJSON output
     ```
     **Vulnerability Point Identified**: `rs merge` tool loads a GeoJSON file using `geojson.load(fp)`. It then processes geometries using `shapely.geometry.shape()`. This is a direct point where a malicious GeoJSON file could be processed. If the `geojson.load()` parser or `shapely.geometry.shape()` function has vulnerabilities, providing a malicious GeoJSON to `rs merge` could trigger them.

  2. **`robosat/tools/dedupe.py`**:
     ```python
     import json # Note: uses json.load instead of geojson.load here, but for GeoJSON it's usually compatible.
     import argparse
     import functools
     import geojson
     from tqdm import tqdm
     import shapely.geometry
     # ...
     def main(args):
         with open(args.osm) as fp:
             osm = json.load(fp) # <-- GeoJSON input parsing (using json.load)
         # ...
         with open(args.predicted) as fp:
             predicted = json.load(fp) # <-- GeoJSON input parsing (using json.load)
         predicted_shapes = [shapely.geometry.shape(features["geometry"]) for features in predicted["features"]] # Shapely processing
         # ...
         collection = geojson.FeatureCollection(features)
         with open(args.out, "w") as fp:
             geojson.dump(collection, fp) # GeoJSON output
     ```
     **Vulnerability Point Identified**: `rs dedupe` tool loads two GeoJSON files (`args.osm`, `args.predicted`) using `json.load(fp)`. Although it uses `json.load` instead of `geojson.load`, for standard GeoJSON, `json.load` should also parse it. Similar to `rs merge`, it then processes geometries using `shapely.geometry.shape()`. Malicious GeoJSON files provided to `rs dedupe` as `args.osm` or `args.predicted` could exploit vulnerabilities in parsing or geometry processing.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Craft a malicious GeoJSON file (`malicious.geojson`)**: This file will be designed to potentially exploit known vulnerabilities or common weaknesses in GeoJSON parsers or `shapely`. For example, create a GeoJSON with an extremely large number of coordinates in a polygon to test for resource exhaustion or parsing errors (although resource exhaustion is excluded). A more targeted approach would be to research known vulnerabilities in `geojson` and `shapely` for the versions used by RoboSat and craft a GeoJSON that triggers these vulnerabilities. For a basic test, let's create a GeoJSON with a very deeply nested structure.

     ```json
     {
       "type": "FeatureCollection",
       "features": [
         {
           "type": "Feature",
           "properties": {},
           "geometry": {
             "type": "Polygon",
             "coordinates": [[
               [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0],
               [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0],
               // ... repeat many times to create a large coordinate list ...
               [0, 0], [0, 0]
             ]]
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
     For a more targeted test, research CVEs for `geojson` and `shapely` and create a GeoJSON that matches a known exploit.

  2. **Run `rs merge` with the malicious GeoJSON**:
     ```bash
     ./rs merge malicious.geojson --threshold 10 output.geojson
     ```

  3. **Observe the behavior**:
     - Check for error messages during execution.
     - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) to see if parsing the malicious file causes excessive consumption, although DoS is excluded.
     - Ideally, if a code execution vulnerability is present, it would manifest in unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even shell access (in a highly vulnerable scenario, which is less likely but possible).

  4. **Run `rs dedupe` with the malicious GeoJSON**:
      ```bash
      # Create a dummy OSM GeoJSON for dedupe to compare against
      echo '{"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": []}' > dummy_osm.geojson
      ./rs dedupe dummy_osm.geojson malicious.geojson --threshold 0.5 output_deduped.geojson
      ```
      - Observe the behavior similarly to step 3 for `rs merge`.

  5. **Analyze the results**: If the tools crash, hang, or exhibit unexpected errors when processing `malicious.geojson`, it indicates a potential vulnerability in GeoJSON parsing. Further investigation and more targeted malicious GeoJSON files (based on known CVEs if available) would be needed to confirm and characterize the vulnerability, especially to check for code execution. If no immediate crash occurs, deeper analysis of the code execution path with debugging tools might be necessary to identify subtle vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability list highlights a potential risk due to the project's reliance on external libraries for parsing and processing potentially untrusted GeoJSON data. Missing input validation and sanitization are the key missing mitigations.
