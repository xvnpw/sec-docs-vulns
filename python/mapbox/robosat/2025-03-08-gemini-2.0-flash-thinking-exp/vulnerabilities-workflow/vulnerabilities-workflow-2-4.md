- Vulnerability name: Insecure Deployment of Flask Development Server
- Description: The `rs serve` tool utilizes Flask's built-in development server, which is not designed for production environments due to its inherent security and performance limitations. When `rs serve` is deployed using the default `app.run()` configuration, it exposes the application through this development server. This setup lacks essential security hardening measures typically required for production, such as running behind a production-ready WSGI server, enforcing HTTPS, and implementing proper access control. An attacker could exploit this insecure deployment to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the service.
    1. The user deploys the `rs serve` functionality to make segmentation masks accessible via a web-based tile server.
    2. The `rs serve` tool, by default, uses the Flask development server started with `app.run()`.
    3. If deployed in a production environment without additional security measures, the application runs on this development server.
    4. An attacker can interact with the publicly accessible `rs serve` instance, which is served by the Flask development server.
    5. Due to the lack of production-level security configurations, the attacker could potentially exploit weaknesses inherent in development servers to gain unauthorized access, cause disruptions, or expose sensitive information.
- Impact: Deploying `rs serve` with the default Flask development server in a production environment can lead to several security risks.
    - Unauthorized Access: Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in a basic Flask development server setup can allow attackers to access the server and the data it processes without legitimate credentials.
    - Information Disclosure: Debugging features potentially enabled or easily enabled in development servers could inadvertently expose sensitive configuration details, code, or internal data to attackers.
    - Service Disruption: Development servers are not optimized for handling high traffic or resisting attacks, making them more susceptible to disruptions and potentially denial-of-service conditions, even if not the primary vulnerability type.
    - Lack of HTTPS: Default development server setups often do not enforce HTTPS, leading to potential eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially concerning data transmitted between the server and users.
- Vulnerability rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations: None
- Missing mitigations:
    - Production WSGI Server: Replace the Flask development server with a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. This is crucial for performance and security in production deployments.
    - HTTPS Enforcement: Configure the server to enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication between the server and clients, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the tile server, ensuring only authorized users can access segmentation masks.
    - Production Configuration: Explicitly set Flask environment to 'production' (`FLASK_ENV=production`) to disable debug mode and other development-specific features that are insecure for production.
- Preconditions:
    - The `rs serve` functionality is deployed in a production or publicly accessible environment.
    - The deployment relies on the default Flask development server configuration initiated by `app.run()` in `robosat/tools/serve.py`.
    - No additional security measures like a production WSGI server, HTTPS, or authentication are implemented during deployment.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/robosat/tools/serve.py`
    - Step 1: The `serve` tool is implemented in `robosat/tools/serve.py` using Flask.
    - Step 2: The Flask application is initialized and routes are defined for serving tiles.
    - Step 3: The server is started using `app.run(host=args.host, port=args.port, threaded=False)` in the `main` function.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        robosat/tools/serve.py
        ├── import Flask, ...
        ├── app = Flask(__name__)
        ├── @app.route("/") ...
        ├── @app.route("/<int:z>/<int:x>/<int:y>.png") ...
        ├── def main(args):
        │   ...
        │   app.run(host=args.host, port=args.port, threaded=False)  # Insecure default Flask dev server
        ```
    - Step 4: The `app.run()` method, when used as shown, starts the Flask development server. This server is intended for development and testing, not for production due to security and performance concerns.
    - Step 5: There is no configuration within `robosat/tools/serve.py` to switch to a production WSGI server or enforce security best practices for deployment, making it vulnerable if used directly in production.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Deploy RoboSat with the `rs serve` functionality enabled on a publicly accessible server. Use the default command to start the server as described in the RoboSat documentation for `rs serve`, ensuring no additional production configurations are manually added (like using gunicorn or setting `FLASK_ENV='production'`).
    - Step 2: Access the deployed `rs serve` instance using a web browser or a tool like `curl` via HTTP (e.g., `http://<server-ip>:<port>/`).
    - Step 3: Send a request to retrieve a tile, for example, by accessing a URL like `http://<server-ip>:<port>/18/69105/105093.png`. Verify that the tile server responds and serves the segmentation mask as expected over HTTP.
    - Step 4: Investigate the server headers in the HTTP response (using browser developer tools or `curl -v`). Check for headers that indicate the use of the Flask development server (e.g., `Server: Werkzeug/0.15.4 Development Server Python/3.7.3`). The presence of such headers confirms that the insecure development server is running.
    - Step 5: Attempt to access the server over HTTPS (`https://<server-ip>:<port>/`). Observe that HTTPS is either not enabled or not properly configured by default, likely resulting in a connection error or a browser warning, further indicating the lack of production security measures.
    - Step 6: (Optional but Recommended) If Flask debug mode was somehow enabled (though not directly shown in code, but a risk in dev server misconfiguration), attempt to trigger debug endpoints or information leaks by sending crafted requests that might exploit debug functionalities. While not guaranteed to be exploitable directly from the default code, this step highlights the potential risks associated with development servers in production.
    - Step 7: Conclude that the `rs serve` functionality, when deployed as per default instructions, uses the insecure Flask development server and lacks essential production security configurations like HTTPS and production-grade server software, making it vulnerable for production deployments.
