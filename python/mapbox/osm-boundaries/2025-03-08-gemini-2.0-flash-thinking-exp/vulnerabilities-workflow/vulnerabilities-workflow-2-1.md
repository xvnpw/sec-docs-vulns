### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized OSM Tag Data
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts malicious OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. This data includes a boundary relation with tags that contain malicious JavaScript code, for example in the `name` tag.
    2. The attacker submits or contributes this malicious OSM data to the OpenStreetMap project or uses a locally crafted OSM PBF file.
    3. The `run.py` script is executed to process this OSM PBF file.
    4. The `osmosis` command filters the OSM data to include administrative boundaries as configured by the script arguments.
    5. The `osmjs` command, using the `process-boundaries.js` script, processes the filtered OSM data. It is assumed that `process-boundaries.js` extracts tag values (like the `name` tag) from the OSM relations and inserts them into a database table (e.g., `carto_boundary`). For the purpose of this vulnerability, we assume it inserts the `name` tag value into a text column, for example, a newly added column called `boundary_name` in the `carto_boundary` table.
    6. The malicious JavaScript code from the OSM `name` tag is now stored in the `boundary_name` column in the database.
    7. A separate web application, which is not part of the provided code but is assumed to exist as per the project description (for rendering purposes), retrieves data from the `carto_boundary` table, including the `boundary_name` column, and displays it on a web page.
    8. If this web application does not properly sanitize or encode the `boundary_name` content before displaying it in the HTML, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser when they view the web page.
- Impact:
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when viewing a web page that displays boundary data.
    - This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the web page, or other malicious actions depending on the attacker's intentions and the capabilities of the web application.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided `run.py` script or other provided files. The focus of the provided code is on data processing and database import, not on output sanitization for rendering.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization in the `process-boundaries.js` script (which is not provided but is part of the processing pipeline). This script should sanitize or encode potentially harmful characters from OSM tag values *before* inserting them into the database.
    - Output encoding in the web application that renders the boundary data retrieved from the database. This is a crucial mitigation in the rendering application to prevent XSS when displaying data like `boundary_name`. The web application must ensure that any user-controlled data displayed in HTML is properly encoded (e.g., using HTML entity encoding) to prevent JavaScript injection.
- Preconditions:
    - A vulnerable `process-boundaries.js` script that extracts and stores OSM tag values, including those that can contain user-controlled text (like `name` tags), into the database without sanitization.
    - A web application that retrieves and displays this unsanitized data from the database without proper output encoding.
    - The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious OSM data. This could be through contributing to OpenStreetMap, or by providing a crafted OSM PBF file if the system processes local files.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided `run.py` script itself does not perform any sanitization of OSM data. It uses `osmosis` and `osmjs` to process OSM data and import it into a PostgreSQL database.
    - The vulnerability is not directly in `run.py`, but in the data processing pipeline it sets up, specifically in how `process-boundaries.js` (not provided) handles OSM tag data and the lack of output sanitization in a hypothetical rendering application.
    - The relevant part of `run.py` is the execution of `osmjs`:
    ```python
    subprocess.call(['osmjs -l sparsetable -r -j process-boundaries.js {0} | psql -h {1} -p {2} -U {3} -d {4} > /dev/null'.format(
            outfile,
            args.db_host,
            args.db_port,
            args.db_user,
            args.db_name)],
        shell=True)
    ```
    - This line executes `process-boundaries.js` with `osmjs` and pipes its output to `psql` to insert data into the database. If `process-boundaries.js` extracts tag values and doesn't sanitize them before outputting them in a format that `psql` imports, then the database will contain unsanitized data.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft Malicious OSM Data:** Create an OSM PBF file (e.g., `xss_boundary.osm.pbf`) containing a boundary relation. Add a tag `name` to this relation with the value `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`. This can be done using OSM editing tools or programmatically.
    2. **Run `run.py` with Malicious Data:** Execute the `run.py` script to process the crafted PBF file. For example: `python run.py -f 2 -t 2 xss_boundary.osm.pbf`. This will import the boundary data, including the malicious `name` tag, into the PostgreSQL database.
    3. **Database Inspection (Simulated):** While `process-boundaries.js` and the rendering application are not provided, for testing purposes, we would need to:
        - Hypothetically modify `process-boundaries.js` (if we had it) to ensure it extracts the `name` tag and includes it in the output piped to `psql`.
        - Assume or create a `boundary_name` TEXT column in the `carto_boundary` table.
        - After running `run.py`, inspect the `carto_boundary` table in the PostgreSQL database to confirm that the `boundary_name` column (or whichever column is intended to store the name) contains the malicious JavaScript code `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>` for the imported boundary.
    4. **Simulate Vulnerable Rendering:** Create a simple web page that simulates the rendering application. This page should:
        - Connect to the same PostgreSQL database.
        - Query the `carto_boundary` table and retrieve the `boundary_name` for the imported boundary.
        - Display the retrieved `boundary_name` value in the HTML of the page *without any HTML encoding*. For example, directly inserting it into an HTML element using JavaScript or a server-side templating engine without escaping.
    5. **Trigger XSS:** Open the created web page in a web browser. If a JavaScript alert box appears with the message "XSS Vulnerability", then the stored XSS vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that malicious JavaScript code injected through OSM data and processed by the pipeline can be executed in a user's browser due to lack of sanitization and output encoding.
