- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection via Malicious OSM Data

- Description:
    1. The `run.py` script processes an OSM PBF file using `osmjs` and `process-boundaries.js`.
    2. The output of `osmjs` (which is assumed to be SQL INSERT statements generated by `process-boundaries.js` based on the OSM data) is directly piped to `psql` for execution against the PostgreSQL database.
    3. If the `process-boundaries.js` script does not properly sanitize data extracted from the OSM file (such as tags, names, or other properties) before embedding it into SQL INSERT statements, a malicious OSM PBF file can be crafted to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    4. An attacker can create a malicious OSM PBF file containing specially crafted data within tags or other OSM attributes.
    5. When `run.py` processes this malicious file, `osmjs` and `process-boundaries.js` will generate SQL INSERT statements that include the malicious SQL code from the OSM data.
    6. These malicious SQL statements are then executed by `psql` against the database, leading to SQL injection.

- Impact:
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the PostgreSQL database.
    - This could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, or even complete database takeover, depending on the privileges of the database user used by `run.py` (typically `postgres`).
    - In a successful attack, an attacker could potentially read sensitive data, modify application data, insert backdoors, or compromise the entire system if the database user has sufficient privileges.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any input sanitization for OSM data before it is processed by `osmjs` and inserted into the database. The script relies on external `osmjs` and `process-boundaries.js` for data processing and SQL generation, and there is no indication of sanitization within the provided `run.py` script.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: The `process-boundaries.js` (or potentially within `run.py` if it were directly constructing SQL queries) needs to sanitize all data extracted from the OSM file before including it in SQL queries. This should include escaping special characters or using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    - Review `process-boundaries.js`: The security of the entire process heavily relies on the security of `process-boundaries.js`. A thorough security audit of this JavaScript code is necessary to confirm if and how it sanitizes OSM data before generating SQL.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: The database user used by `run.py` should have the minimum necessary privileges required for the application to function. Avoid using a superuser account like `postgres` if possible.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious OSM PBF file as input to the `run.py` script. This could be achieved if the `run.py` script is used in an environment where users can upload or provide their own OSM data for processing. Even if the script is intended for internal use, a compromised internal data source or a supply chain attack could introduce malicious OSM data.
    - The `process-boundaries.js` script must be vulnerable to SQL injection, meaning it does not properly sanitize OSM data before using it in SQL queries.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Database Connection:** The `run.py` script establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2.connect()`. The connection details are taken from command-line arguments (`args.db_name`, `args.db_user`, `args.db_host`, `args.db_port`). While these arguments themselves could be manipulated in some contexts, the primary vulnerability vector is through the OSM data processing.
    2. **OSM Data Processing Command:** The vulnerable part is the `subprocess.call` that executes `osmjs`:
       ```python
       subprocess.call(['osmjs -l sparsetable -r -j process-boundaries.js {0} | psql -h {1} -p {2} -U {3} -d {4} > /dev/null'.format(
               outfile,
               args.db_host,
               args.db_port,
               args.db_user,
               args.db_name)],
           shell=True)
       ```
       - This command pipes the output of `osmjs -l sparsetable -r -j process-boundaries.js {0}` directly to `psql`.
       - `{0}` is `outfile`, which is a filtered OSM PBF file generated by the previous `osmosis` command.
       - `process-boundaries.js` is responsible for processing the OSM data from `outfile` and generating SQL INSERT statements.
       - The crucial point is that the output of `process-boundaries.js` is treated as trusted SQL input and directly executed by `psql`.
       - **Vulnerability Point:** If `process-boundaries.js` embeds data from the OSM file into SQL queries without proper sanitization, it becomes possible to inject malicious SQL code through a crafted OSM file.
    3. **No Sanitization in `run.py`:** The `run.py` script itself does not perform any sanitization of the OSM data before passing it to `osmjs` and subsequently to `psql`. It blindly trusts the output of `process-boundaries.js`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious OSM Data:** Create a small OSM PBF file (e.g., `malicious.osm.pbf`) containing a boundary relation. Within the tags of this relation, include a malicious SQL payload. For example, in the `name` tag, use a value like: `"; DROP TABLE carto_boundary; --"`. This payload attempts to execute a `DROP TABLE` command after the intended `INSERT` statement, and then comments out the rest of the query. You would need to use tools like `osmium` or `JOSM` to create or edit OSM PBF files. A simplified textual representation of such an OSM file (not directly usable, but illustrative) might look like this (assuming `process-boundaries.js` uses the `name` tag in SQL queries):
       ```xml
       <osm version="0.6" generator="test">
         <relation id="-1" visible="true" version="1">
           <tag k="type" v="boundary"/>
           <tag k="boundary" v="administrative"/>
           <tag k="admin_level" v="2"/>
           <tag k="name" v='"; DROP TABLE carto_boundary; --'/>
           <member type="way" ref="-2" role="outer"/>
         </relation>
         <way id="-2" visible="true" version="1">
           <nd ref="-3"/>
           <nd ref="-4"/>
           <tag k="highway" v="residential"/>
         </way>
         <node id="-3" visible="true" version="1" lat="0.0" lon="0.0"/>
         <node id="-4" visible="true" version="1" lat="0.1" lon="0.1"/>
       </osm>
       ```
       Convert this XML-like representation into a valid PBF file using OSM tools.
    2. **Run `run.py` with Malicious Data:** Execute the `run.py` script, providing the `malicious.osm.pbf` file as input. Adjust database connection parameters as needed to point to a test database.
       ```bash
       python run.py -f 2 -t 2 malicious.osm.pbf -d testdb -U testuser -H localhost -p 5432
       ```
       (Replace `testdb`, `testuser`, etc., with your test database credentials.)
    3. **Verify SQL Injection:** After running the script, connect to the `testdb` database using `psql` or a similar tool and check if the `carto_boundary` table has been dropped.
       ```bash
       psql -d testdb -U testuser -h localhost -p 5432 -c "\dt"
       ```
       If the `carto_boundary` table is missing from the list of tables, it confirms that the SQL injection was successful and the `DROP TABLE` command was executed.
    4. **Expected Outcome:** If the vulnerability exists in `process-boundaries.js` and the test case is successful, the `carto_boundary` table in the `testdb` database should be dropped after running `run.py` with the malicious OSM file. This demonstrates the critical impact of the SQL injection vulnerability.
