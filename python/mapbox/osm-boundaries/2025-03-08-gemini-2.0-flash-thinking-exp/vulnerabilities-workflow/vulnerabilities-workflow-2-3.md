### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `psql` command
- Description:
    1. The `run.py` script executes the `psql` command using `subprocess.call` with `shell=True`.
    2. The arguments for the `psql` command, specifically database connection parameters like hostname, port, username, and database name, are constructed using string formatting with values taken directly from command-line arguments (`args.db_host`, `args.db_port`, `args.db_user`, `args.db_name`).
    3. Due to the use of `shell=True` in `subprocess.call` and the lack of sanitization of these command-line arguments, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
    4. By crafting malicious command-line arguments, an attacker can manipulate the `psql` command string to execute arbitrary commands on the system. For example, injecting shell commands into the `db_name` argument.
- Impact:
    - Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the `run.py` script.
    - This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data within the PostgreSQL database or the file system.
        - **System Compromise:** Full control over the server, potentially allowing the attacker to install malware, create backdoors, or pivot to other systems.
        - **Denial of Service:** Disrupting the availability of the system or related services.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The script uses string formatting to construct the shell command, which does not provide any protection against command injection when `shell=True` is used.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Use `subprocess.Popen` with argument lists instead of `shell=True` and string commands:** This approach avoids shell interpretation of the command and its arguments, preventing command injection.  Instead of passing a single string to `subprocess.call` with `shell=True`, pass a list of arguments directly to `subprocess.Popen` (or `subprocess.call` which uses `Popen` internally).
    - **Input Sanitization:** While parameterization is the preferred solution for command injection, input sanitization could be added as a defense-in-depth measure. However, properly sanitizing shell command arguments is complex and error-prone, making parameterization the safer and recommended approach.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `run.py` script.
    - The attacker must be able to provide command-line arguments to the `run.py` script (e.g., when running it from a shell or through a web interface if the script is exposed via a web application, although this is not evident from the provided files).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerable code snippet is in the `run.py` file within the `subprocess.call` command:
    ```python
    subprocess.call(['osmjs -l sparsetable -r -j process-boundaries.js {0} | psql -h {1} -p {2} -U {3} -d {4} > /dev/null'.format(
            outfile,
            args.db_host,
            args.db_port,
            args.db_user,
            args.db_name)],
        shell=True)
    ```
    - **Line-by-line breakdown:**
        - `subprocess.call([...], shell=True)`: This executes a shell command. `shell=True` is the key factor that enables command injection because it allows the shell to interpret metacharacters and commands within the provided string.
        - `'osmjs -l sparsetable ... | psql -h {1} ... -d {4} > /dev/null'`: This is the shell command string being constructed. It pipes the output of `osmjs` to `psql`.
        - `.format(outfile, args.db_host, args.db_port, args.db_user, args.db_name)`: This part inserts the values of `outfile` and the database connection arguments directly into the shell command string.
        - `args.db_host`, `args.db_port`, `args.db_user`, `args.db_name`: These variables are directly taken from user-provided command-line arguments. If these arguments contain malicious shell commands, they will be executed by the shell due to `shell=True`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure you have the `run.py` script and its dependencies set up (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, osmjs, osmosis, Python, Psycopg2).
        - You need to be able to execute `run.py` from your terminal.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the `run.py` script with a malicious `db_name` argument to inject a command. For example, to execute the `whoami` command, use the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        python run.py -d "testdb' -c 'whoami' #" planet.osm.pbf
        ```
        - **Explanation of the malicious argument:**
            - `-d "testdb' -c 'whoami' #"`:  This sets the `db_name` argument to `testdb' -c 'whoami' #`.
            - `testdb'`: This attempts to set the database name to `testdb'`.
            - ` -c 'whoami'`: This is injected shell command. `-c` option in `sh` (and bash) executes the following string as a command. `whoami` is used to print the current user.
            - ` #`: This is a comment in shell scripts. It comments out the rest of the intended `psql` command after the injected command, preventing syntax errors that might stop the injection.
        - Replace `planet.osm.pbf` with a valid or dummy `.osm.pbf` file path if required for the script to run without errors up to the vulnerable point.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the output of the script execution. If the command injection is successful, the output of the `whoami` command (which is the username of the user running the script) should be visible in the standard output or standard error, likely mixed with the script's regular output or error messages if the script fails after the injection. If you redirect standard error to standard output you should clearly see the result of `whoami`. For example, redirect stderr to stdout:
        ```bash
        python run.py -d "testdb' -c 'whoami' #" planet.osm.pbf 2>&1 | grep $(whoami)
        ```
        - If the username is printed, it confirms that the `whoami` command, injected via the `db_name` parameter, was executed by the system, thus demonstrating command injection vulnerability.
