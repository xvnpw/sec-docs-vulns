- Vulnerability Name: Rasterio Image Parsing Vulnerability via Malicious Raster Image
- Description:
    - An attacker crafts a malicious raster image file (e.g., GeoTIFF, PNG, JPEG).
    - This malicious image is provided as either the source (`SRC_PATH`) or reference (`REF_PATH`) image to the `rio-hist` command-line tool.
    - When `rio-hist` uses Rasterio to open and process this malicious image, a vulnerability in Rasterio's image parsing logic is triggered.
    - This vulnerability can be exploited due to flaws in how Rasterio handles malformed or specifically crafted image files.
    - Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio-hist`.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution.
    - Complete compromise of the system running `rio-hist`.
    - Potential data breach if the system has access to sensitive information.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in `rio-hist` project itself.
    - Relies on the security of the Rasterio library and its dependencies (GDAL, image codecs).
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of raster image files beyond what Rasterio performs internally. However, implementing robust validation against all potential Rasterio vulnerabilities in `rio-hist` is impractical and should be addressed in Rasterio directly.
    - Regularly updating Rasterio and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities is crucial but not explicitly enforced by `rio-hist`.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious raster image file to the `rio-hist` tool. This can be done if the tool is used to process user-uploaded images or images from untrusted sources.
    - A parsing vulnerability must exist within the Rasterio library or its underlying image processing libraries (like GDAL) that the malicious image is designed to exploit.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not within the `rio-hist` codebase itself, but in the dependency `rasterio`.
    - In `rio_hist/scripts/cli.py`, the `hist` function defines `src_path` and `ref_path` as input arguments, representing the paths to the source and reference raster images.
    - In `rio_hist/match.py`, the `hist_match_worker` function opens these raster files using `rasterio.open(src_path)` and `rasterio.open(ref_path)`.
    - ```python
      with rasterio.open(src_path) as src:
          profile = src.profile.copy()
          src_arr = src.read(masked=True)
          src_mask, src_fill = calculate_mask(src, src_arr)
          src_arr = src_arr.filled()

      with rasterio.open(ref_path) as ref:
          ref_arr = ref.read(masked=True)
          ref_mask, ref_fill = calculate_mask(ref, ref_arr)
          ref_arr = ref_arr.filled()
      ```
    - The `rasterio.open()` function call initiates the parsing of the raster image file. If the provided image is maliciously crafted to exploit a parsing vulnerability in Rasterio (which could be in its format handling, metadata parsing, or data reading routines), it will be triggered at this point.
    - The subsequent `src.read(masked=True)` and `ref.read(masked=True)` calls further interact with the parsed image data and could also trigger vulnerabilities if the initial parsing stage didn't.
    - The vulnerability lies within Rasterio's handling of image files, which is largely implemented in C/C++ within GDAL and other libraries that Rasterio depends on. `rio-hist` acts as a conduit by using Rasterio to process potentially malicious images.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Identify a known or potential image parsing vulnerability in Rasterio or GDAL. This could involve researching CVEs, security advisories, or performing fuzzing on Rasterio's image parsing capabilities. For example, if a CVE indicates a buffer overflow in GeoTIFF parsing in GDAL (which Rasterio uses), this would be a target vulnerability.
    - Step 2: Create a malicious raster image file (e.g., `malicious.tif`) specifically designed to trigger the identified Rasterio/GDAL vulnerability. This might involve manipulating image headers, metadata fields, or pixel data in a way that exploits the vulnerability (e.g., causing a buffer overflow when Rasterio attempts to read a specific part of the image).
    - Step 3: Prepare a valid reference image (e.g., `valid_reference.tif`) to be used as the reference input for `rio-hist`.
    - Step 4: Execute the `rio-hist` command-line tool, providing the malicious image as the source and the valid image as the reference:
      ```bash
      rio hist malicious.tif valid_reference.tif output.tif
      ```
      Alternatively, test with the malicious image as the reference:
      ```bash
      rio hist valid_source.tif malicious.tif output.tif
      ```
    - Step 5: Monitor the execution of `rio-hist`. Observe for signs of successful vulnerability exploitation, such as:
        - Program crash (segmentation fault or other unexpected termination).
        - Error messages indicating memory corruption or security-related issues.
        - If arbitrary code execution is achieved, look for indicators like unexpected system behavior, unauthorized file access, or network connections initiated by the `rio-hist` process.
    - Step 6: If the test results in a crash or other signs of exploitation when processing the malicious image, it confirms the vulnerability. The severity would depend on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., denial of service, arbitrary code execution). For a critical vulnerability like arbitrary code execution, successful exploitation would mean an attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.
