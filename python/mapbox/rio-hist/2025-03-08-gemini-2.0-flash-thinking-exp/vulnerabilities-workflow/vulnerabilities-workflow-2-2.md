- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious TIFF Image (CVE-2023-38473)
- Description:
    - A user can be tricked into opening a maliciously crafted TIFF image using `rio-hist`.
    - `rio-hist` uses the `rasterio` library to read and process geospatial raster images, including TIFF files.
    - `rasterio` version 1.0.x and earlier is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38473, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `libtiff` library it uses for TIFF image parsing.
    - By processing a specially crafted TIFF image (either as a source or reference image in `rio-hist`), an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
    - The heap buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio-hist`.
    - The vulnerability is triggered during the image loading phase when `rasterio` parses the malicious TIFF file.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
    - An attacker could gain full control of the system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on the network.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. `rio-hist` directly uses the vulnerable `rasterio` library.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Dependency Update**: Upgrade `rasterio` to a version that includes a patched `libtiff` or uses a different TIFF parsing library that is not vulnerable to CVE-2023-38473.  `rasterio` versions >= 1.3.7 are not vulnerable.
    - **Input Validation**: While difficult to fully prevent in image parsing, implementing checks on file headers or using safer image processing libraries could be considered for defense in depth, but updating `rasterio` is the primary and most effective mitigation.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must use `rio-hist` to process a maliciously crafted TIFF image.
    - `rio-hist` must be installed with a vulnerable version of `rasterio` (<= 1.0.x).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly in `rio-hist`'s code but in its dependency `rasterio`.
    - `rio-hist` uses `rasterio.open()` to open both source and reference images in the `hist_match_worker` function in `/code/rio_hist/match.py`:
    ```python
    with rasterio.open(src_path) as src:
        profile = src.profile.copy()
        src_arr = src.read(masked=True)
        src_mask, src_fill = calculate_mask(src, src_arr)
        src_arr = src_arr.filled()

    with rasterio.open(ref_path) as ref:
        ref_arr = ref.read(masked=True)
        ref_mask, ref_fill = calculate_mask(ref, ref_arr)
        ref_arr = ref_arr.filled()
    ```
    - The `rasterio.open()` function, when handling TIFF images, relies on `libtiff`.
    - CVE-2023-38473 is a heap buffer overflow in `libtiff`'s handling of `LogLuvDecode`.
    - When `rasterio.open()` is called on a malicious TIFF, `libtiff` is invoked to parse the image.
    - If the TIFF image is crafted to trigger the vulnerability in `libtiff`'s `LogLuvDecode` function, it can cause a heap buffer overflow.
    - This overflow can overwrite memory and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    - The `rio-hist` code itself does not perform any checks on the TIFF image content to prevent this. It simply passes the file path to `rasterio.open()`.
    - The `requirements.txt` file specifies `rasterio~=1.0`, indicating that vulnerable versions of `rasterio` are allowed and likely to be used.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Test Environment**:
        - Create a virtual environment for testing.
        - Install `rio-hist` and the vulnerable `rasterio` version.  You might need to force install `rasterio==1.0.0` or similar if a newer version is installed by default.
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv_rio_hist_vuln
        source venv_rio_hist_vuln/bin/activate  # or venv_rio_hist_vuln\Scripts\activate on Windows
        pip install -r /code/requirements.txt
        pip uninstall rasterio # uninstall any newer version
        pip install rasterio==1.0.0 # install vulnerable version
        pip install -e /code/ # install rio-hist in editable mode
        ```
    2. **Prepare Malicious TIFF Image**:
        - Obtain or create a malicious TIFF image that exploits CVE-2023-38473. Public exploit code or PoCs for CVE-2023-38473 may be available online and can be adapted.  For example, a PoC might involve a TIFF file crafted to trigger the heap buffer overflow in `libtiff` when `LogLuvDecode` is used.
        - Let's assume you have a malicious TIFF file named `malicious.tif` in the `/tmp/` directory.
    3. **Run `rio-hist` with Malicious TIFF**:
        - Use the `rio hist` command-line tool, providing the malicious TIFF as the source image and a valid (dummy) TIFF as the reference image. Specify an output path.
        ```bash
        rio hist /tmp/malicious.tif tests/data/reference1.tif /tmp/output.tif
        ```
        - Alternatively, use the malicious TIFF as the reference image:
        ```bash
        rio hist tests/data/source1.tif /tmp/malicious.tif /tmp/output.tif
        ```
    4. **Verify Code Execution**:
        - Successful exploitation would result in arbitrary code execution. The exact manifestation depends on the payload in the malicious TIFF.
        - **Simplest Verification (Crash):** If the exploit is successful in causing a heap buffer overflow but doesn't have a specific payload, it might lead to a crash of the `rio` process. Check if the `rio hist` command exits with an error or crashes unexpectedly.
        - **Payload Verification (e.g., create file):** For a more definitive test, the malicious TIFF could be crafted to execute a simple command like creating a file in the `/tmp/` directory. Monitor for the creation of this file after running the `rio hist` command. If the file is created, it confirms arbitrary code execution.
        - **Process Monitoring:** Use system monitoring tools to observe if any unexpected processes are spawned or if there are unusual system activities after running `rio hist` with the malicious TIFF.

This test case demonstrates that processing a malicious TIFF image with `rio-hist` (using a vulnerable `rasterio`) can lead to code execution, confirming the vulnerability.

To remediate this vulnerability, the project should update the `rasterio` dependency to a version >= 1.3.7 in `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`.
