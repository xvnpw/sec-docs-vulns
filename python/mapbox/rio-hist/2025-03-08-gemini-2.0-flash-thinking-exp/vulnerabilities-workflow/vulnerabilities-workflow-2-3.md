### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Raster Image Processing Vulnerability via Maliciously Crafted Image
- Description:
    - An attacker can create a maliciously crafted raster image file (e.g., TIFF, GeoTIFF).
    - This malicious image is then provided as either the source (`SRC_PATH`) or reference (`REF_PATH`) input to the `rio hist` command-line tool.
    - When `rio-hist` processes this image using `rasterio` and the underlying GDAL library, a vulnerability in GDAL's image parsing or processing is triggered.
    - This vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio-hist`. The vulnerability is triggered during the initial parsing of the image file by `rasterio.open()` or during subsequent processing steps performed by GDAL when `rasterio` reads or manipulates the image data.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the system where `rio-hist` is executed.
    - Full compromise of the affected system is possible, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as data exfiltration, installation of malware, or further propagation within a network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in `rio-hist` project directly. `rio-hist` relies on the security of `rasterio` and GDAL.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: `rio-hist` does not perform any specific validation on the input raster image files beyond what `rasterio` and GDAL inherently do.
    - Dependency updates: Regularly updating `rasterio` and GDAL to their latest versions is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities. However, `rio-hist` does not enforce specific versions or provide guidance on dependency management for security.
    - Security scanning: Integrating security scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies like `rasterio` and GDAL would be a proactive mitigation.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to provide a maliciously crafted raster image file to a user.
    - The user must execute the `rio hist` command-line tool, using the malicious image as either the source or reference image.
    - The system running `rio-hist` must be vulnerable to the specific image processing vulnerability in `rasterio` or GDAL that is being exploited.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the `rio-hist` code itself, but rather in the underlying libraries (`rasterio`, GDAL) used for image processing.
    - The attack vector is through the `rio hist` CLI, specifically when it opens and processes raster image files provided as arguments.
    - `rio_hist/scripts/cli.py`: The `hist` function uses `click` to parse command-line arguments `src_path` and `ref_path`, which are file paths to the source and reference raster images.
    - `rio_hist/match.py`: The `hist_match_worker` function is called by the `hist` CLI command.
        - It opens the source and reference raster files using `rasterio.open(src_path)` and `rasterio.open(ref_path)`.
        - `rasterio.open()` in turn uses GDAL to parse and read the image file. This is the point where a maliciously crafted image can trigger a vulnerability in GDAL.
        - The function then reads the raster data using `src.read(masked=True)` and `ref.read(masked=True)`. Further processing by GDAL might occur during the read operation, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.
        - Subsequent histogram matching and color space conversion operations are performed on the raster data loaded by `rasterio`. If the vulnerability is triggered during the initial parsing or reading, arbitrary code execution might occur before reaching these steps.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        [Attacker provides malicious image] --> rio hist CLI (scripts/cli.py) --> hist_match_worker (match.py) --> rasterio.open(malicious_image) --> GDAL (Image parsing/processing vulnerability) --> Arbitrary Code Execution
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Obtain or create a maliciously crafted raster image file (e.g., a TIFF file designed to exploit a known or hypothetical vulnerability in GDAL's TIFF parsing). For example, this could be a TIFF image with a crafted header or corrupted metadata that triggers a buffer overflow when parsed by GDAL.
    - Step 2: Save the malicious image file to a location accessible to the system running `rio-hist`, for example, `/tmp/malicious.tif`.
    - Step 3: Execute the `rio hist` command, providing the malicious image as the source image and a benign image as the reference, or vice-versa. For example:
        ```bash
        rio hist /tmp/malicious.tif tests/data/reference1.tif output.tif
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        rio hist tests/data/source1.tif /tmp/malicious.tif output.tif
        ```
    - Step 4: Observe the system's behavior.
        - Expected behavior in case of vulnerability exploitation: The command might crash, hang, or, in a successful exploit, execute arbitrary code. To detect code execution, one could attempt to use a malicious image designed to execute a simple command like creating a file in `/tmp` or initiating a network connection to a controlled server.
        - If a crash occurs, examine error logs or use debugging tools to confirm the crash originates from GDAL or `rasterio` during image processing.
    - Step 5: If arbitrary code execution is confirmed, document the steps, the malicious image file, and the versions of `rio-hist`, `rasterio`, and GDAL used to reproduce the vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights the risk of processing untrusted raster image files, especially when relying on complex libraries like GDAL which have a history of security vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability is not in `rio-hist`'s own code, `rio-hist` is vulnerable by design as it directly processes external raster images using these libraries. Mitigation would primarily involve ensuring the underlying libraries (`rasterio` and GDAL) are up-to-date and potentially implementing input sanitization or sandboxing measures if feasible, although the latter is complex for image processing workflows.
