- vulnerability name: Potential Rasterio Image Parsing Vulnerability Exposure
- description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious raster image file (e.g., TIFF, GeoTIFF, or other raster formats supported by Rasterio) specifically designed to exploit a known or unknown parsing vulnerability within the Rasterio library.
  2. The attacker uses the `rio hist` command-line tool, providing the malicious raster image file as either the source image (`SRC_PATH`) or the reference image (`REF_PATH`) argument.
  3. When `rio hist` processes the command, it utilizes the Rasterio library to open and read the provided raster image file through functions like `rasterio.open()` and `src.read()`.
  4. If the malicious raster image successfully triggers a parsing vulnerability in Rasterio during the file opening or reading process, this can lead to undesirable outcomes such as arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or other security breaches within the environment where `rio hist` is being executed.
- impact: Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running `rio hist`. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- vulnerability rank: High
- currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. `rio-hist` itself does not implement any specific mitigations against raster image parsing vulnerabilities. It relies on the underlying Rasterio library for image processing and inherits any vulnerabilities present in Rasterio.
- missing mitigations:
  - Input validation: Implement content-based validation of input raster files to detect and reject potentially malicious files before they are processed by Rasterio. This could include checks for file format anomalies, header inconsistencies, or other suspicious patterns. However, robust validation against all possible malicious raster files is complex.
  - Dependency review and updates: Regularly review and update the Rasterio dependency to the latest version to ensure that any known parsing vulnerabilities in Rasterio are patched. Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
  - Sandboxing or isolation: Execute the `rio hist` process in a sandboxed environment or with reduced privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit. This could involve using containerization technologies or process isolation mechanisms.
- preconditions:
  - The attacker must have the ability to supply a malicious raster image file path as either the source or reference image to the `rio hist` command. This is typically the case when using the command-line tool in a standard operating environment.
  - A parsing vulnerability must exist within the version of the Rasterio library used by `rio-hist` that can be triggered by the crafted malicious raster image.
- source code analysis:
  - In the `rio_hist/scripts/cli.py` file, the `hist` function defines the command-line interface and takes `src_path` and `ref_path` as arguments using `click.Path(exists=True)`. This ensures that the provided paths exist but does not perform any content validation.
  - The `hist` function then calls `hist_match_worker` in `rio_hist/match.py`, passing the `src_path` and `ref_path` directly.
  - Within `hist_match_worker` in `rio_hist/match.py`, the code uses `rasterio.open(src_path)` and `rasterio.open(ref_path)` to open the raster datasets.
  - Subsequently, `src.read(masked=True)` and `ref.read(masked=True)` are used to read the raster data.
  - If a malicious raster file is provided as `src_path` or `ref_path`, and if `rasterio.open()` or `src.read()` has a parsing vulnerability, the vulnerability will be triggered during these calls, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
  - There are no input sanitization or validation steps performed on the raster file content by `rio-hist` before passing the file paths to Rasterio.
- security test case:
  1. Prepare a malicious raster image file (e.g., `malicious.tif`). This file should be crafted to exploit a known or hypothesized parsing vulnerability in Rasterio. For example, if a vulnerability related to TIFF image parsing in Rasterio is known, create a TIFF file that triggers this specific vulnerability. If no specific vulnerability is known, attempt to create a malformed TIFF file that might trigger general parsing errors or unexpected behavior in Rasterio.
  2. On a system where `rio-hist` and Rasterio are installed, open a terminal and execute the `rio hist` command, providing the `malicious.tif` file as the source image and a benign, valid raster image (e.g., from `tests/data/reference1.tif`) as the reference image. Specify an output path (e.g., `output.tif`). The command would look like: `rio hist malicious.tif tests/data/reference1.tif output.tif`.
  3. Monitor the execution of the `rio hist` command. Observe for any of the following indicators of a vulnerability:
     - Program crash or unexpected termination.
     - Error messages related to memory access, segmentation faults, or other low-level errors.
     - Unexpected system behavior, such as unauthorized file access, network connections, or process creation (if arbitrary code execution is suspected).
  4. Examine the output and logs for any signs of successful exploitation. If arbitrary code execution is suspected, attempt to create a more specific exploit to confirm code execution, such as creating a file in a writable directory or establishing a network connection to a controlled server.
  5. If a crash or other anomalous behavior is observed, this indicates a potential vulnerability. Further investigation, potentially including debugging Rasterio with the malicious file, would be needed to confirm the vulnerability and its severity. If arbitrary code execution is achieved, the vulnerability is confirmed as critical.
