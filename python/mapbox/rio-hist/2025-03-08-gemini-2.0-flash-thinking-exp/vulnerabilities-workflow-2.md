## Combined Vulnerability List

### Raster Image Parsing Vulnerability Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Raster Image Parsing Vulnerability via Malicious Raster Image
- **Description:**
    - An attacker crafts a malicious raster image file (e.g., GeoTIFF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, or other formats supported by Rasterio).
    - This malicious image is provided as either the source (`SRC_PATH`) or reference (`REF_PATH`) image to the `rio-hist` command-line tool.
    - When `rio-hist` uses the Rasterio library to open and process this malicious image, a vulnerability in Rasterio's image parsing logic, or in the underlying GDAL library, is triggered. This vulnerability can be exploited due to flaws in how Rasterio and GDAL handle malformed or specifically crafted image files.
    - Specifically, vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-38473, a heap buffer overflow in `libtiff`'s `LogLuvDecode` function (used by Rasterio for TIFF image parsing), can be exploited. Processing a specially crafted TIFF image can trigger this vulnerability during the image loading phase when `rasterio` parses the malicious TIFF file.
    - Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio-hist`. This can occur during the initial parsing of the image file by `rasterio.open()` or during subsequent processing steps performed by GDAL when `rasterio` reads or manipulates the image data via functions like `src.read()`.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution.
    - Complete compromise of the system running `rio-hist`.
    - Potential data breach if the system has access to sensitive information.
    - An attacker could gain full control of the system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on the network.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None in `rio-hist` project itself.
    - Relies on the security of the Rasterio library and its dependencies (GDAL, image codecs).
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Dependency Update**: Upgrade `rasterio` to a version that includes patched dependencies, especially `libtiff`, or uses a different image parsing library that is not vulnerable. For CVE-2023-38473, `rasterio` versions >= 1.3.7 are not vulnerable.
    - **Input Validation**: Implement content-based validation of input raster files to detect and reject potentially malicious files before they are processed by Rasterio. This could include checks for file format anomalies, header inconsistencies, or other suspicious patterns. However, robust validation against all possible malicious raster files is complex and updating dependencies is more effective.
    - **Security scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies like `rasterio` and GDAL would be a proactive mitigation.
    - **Sandboxing or isolation**: Execute the `rio hist` process in a sandboxed environment or with reduced privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit. This could involve using containerization technologies or process isolation mechanisms.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious raster image file to the `rio-hist` tool. This can be done if the tool is used to process user-uploaded images or images from untrusted sources.
    - A parsing vulnerability must exist within the Rasterio library or its underlying image processing libraries (like GDAL, libtiff) that the malicious image is designed to exploit. For example, a vulnerable version of `rasterio` (<= 1.0.x) is required to exploit CVE-2023-38473.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is not within the `rio-hist` codebase itself, but in the dependency `rasterio` and potentially GDAL/libtiff.
    - In `rio_hist/scripts/cli.py`, the `hist` function defines `src_path` and `ref_path` as input arguments, representing the paths to the source and reference raster images. These paths are validated to exist using `click.Path(exists=True)`, but no content validation is performed.
    - In `rio_hist/match.py`, the `hist_match_worker` function opens these raster files using `rasterio.open(src_path)` and `rasterio.open(ref_path)`.
    - ```python
      with rasterio.open(src_path) as src:
          profile = src.profile.copy()
          src_arr = src.read(masked=True)
          src_mask, src_fill = calculate_mask(src, src_arr)
          src_arr = src_arr.filled()

      with rasterio.open(ref_path) as ref:
          ref_arr = ref.read(masked=True)
          ref_mask, ref_fill = calculate_mask(ref, ref_arr)
          ref_arr = ref_arr.filled()
      ```
    - The `rasterio.open()` function call initiates the parsing of the raster image file, leveraging GDAL and libraries like `libtiff` for specific formats. If the provided image is maliciously crafted to exploit a parsing vulnerability in these libraries, it will be triggered at this point. For example, in the case of CVE-2023-38473, a malicious TIFF image will trigger a heap buffer overflow in `libtiff` when `rasterio.open()` processes it.
    - The subsequent `src.read(masked=True)` and `ref.read(masked=True)` calls further interact with the parsed image data and could also trigger vulnerabilities if the initial parsing stage didn't.
    - The vulnerability lies within Rasterio's and its dependencies' handling of image files, which is largely implemented in C/C++ within GDAL, `libtiff` and other libraries. `rio-hist` acts as a conduit by using Rasterio to process potentially malicious images.

- **Security test case:**
    - Step 1: Identify a known or potential image parsing vulnerability in Rasterio, GDAL, or libraries like `libtiff`. For example, CVE-2023-38473 is a known heap buffer overflow in `libtiff`. Research CVEs, security advisories, or perform fuzzing on Rasterio's image parsing capabilities.
    - Step 2: Create a malicious raster image file (e.g., `malicious.tif`) specifically designed to trigger the identified vulnerability. For CVE-2023-38473, a malicious TIFF file crafted to exploit the heap buffer overflow in `libtiff`'s `LogLuvDecode` function is needed. Public exploit code or PoCs might be available for known CVEs.
    - Step 3: Prepare a valid reference image (e.g., `valid_reference.tif`) to be used as the reference input for `rio-hist`.
    - Step 4: Set up a test environment with a vulnerable version of `rio-hist` and `rasterio`. For CVE-2023-38473, ensure `rasterio` version is <= 1.0.x.  This might involve creating a virtual environment and installing specific versions:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv_rio_hist_vuln
      source venv_rio_hist_vuln/bin/activate
      pip install -r /code/requirements.txt
      pip uninstall rasterio # uninstall any newer version
      pip install rasterio==1.0.0 # install vulnerable version for CVE-2023-38473 test
      pip install -e /code/ # install rio-hist in editable mode
      ```
    - Step 5: Execute the `rio-hist` command-line tool, providing the malicious image as the source and the valid image as the reference:
      ```bash
      rio hist malicious.tif valid_reference.tif output.tif
      ```
      Alternatively, test with the malicious image as the reference:
      ```bash
      rio hist valid_source.tif malicious.tif output.tif
      ```
    - Step 6: Monitor the execution of `rio-hist`. Observe for signs of successful vulnerability exploitation, such as:
        - Program crash (segmentation fault or other unexpected termination).
        - Error messages indicating memory corruption or security-related issues.
        - If arbitrary code execution is achieved, look for indicators like unexpected system behavior, unauthorized file access (e.g., creating a file in `/tmp`), or network connections initiated by the `rio-hist` process.
    - Step 7: If the test results in a crash or other signs of exploitation when processing the malicious image, it confirms the vulnerability. For CVE-2023-38473, successful exploitation would mean arbitrary code execution due to heap buffer overflow in `libtiff`.

This combined vulnerability description covers the general raster image parsing vulnerability and provides a concrete example with CVE-2023-38473, highlighting the critical risk of arbitrary code execution when processing untrusted raster images with `rio-hist` due to vulnerabilities in underlying libraries like Rasterio, GDAL, and `libtiff`.
