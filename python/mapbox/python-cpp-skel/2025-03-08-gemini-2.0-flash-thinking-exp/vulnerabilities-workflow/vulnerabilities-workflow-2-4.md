### Vulnerability 1: Unauthenticated and Unverified Download of Mason Packages leading to Potential Remote Code Execution

* Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated and Unverified Download of Mason Packages leading to Potential Remote Code Execution
* Description:
    1. The `Mason` class in `/code/build_scripts/mason.py` is used to manage C++ dependencies.
    2. When a package is required and not found locally, the `Mason.use` method constructs a download URL from `self.mason_repository` and downloads a tar.gz archive using `urlretrieve`.
    3. The downloaded archive is then extracted using `tarfile.open` and `tar.extractall` without any verification of the archive's integrity or authenticity.
    4. An attacker who can perform a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack or compromise the `mason_repository` (e.g., `https://mason-binaries.s3.amazonaws.com`) can replace the legitimate package archive with a malicious one.
    5. When a user installs the Python package (e.g., via `pip install .`), the malicious archive is downloaded and extracted.
    6. If the malicious archive contains executable files or scripts that are executed during or after extraction, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of the user installing the Python package. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code does not implement any form of integrity or authenticity checking for downloaded packages.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement integrity verification: Use checksums (e.g., SHA256) to verify the integrity of downloaded tar.gz archives. The checksums should be obtained from a trusted source, ideally signed by the package maintainers.
    - Implement authenticity verification: Consider using package signing to ensure that the downloaded packages are indeed from a trusted source and have not been tampered with.
    - Use HTTPS for all downloads: While S3 URLs are typically HTTPS, explicitly enforce HTTPS to prevent MITM attacks from downgrading to HTTP.
    - Consider using a more robust package management solution that incorporates security features like checksum verification and signing.
* Preconditions:
    1. The user must install the Python package that uses the `Mason` dependency management (e.g., by running `pip install .` or `pip install -e .`).
    2. Network connectivity to the `mason_repository` is required.
    3. Either the attacker can perform a MITM attack during the download process, or the `mason_repository` itself is compromised.
* Source Code Analysis:
    File: `/code/build_scripts/mason.py`
    ```python
        def use(self, package_name, version, header_only=False):
            ...
            if not os.path.isdir(install_path):
                cache_path = os.path.join(self.mason_package_dir, ".binaries", slug + ".tar.gz")
                ...
                if not os.path.exists(cache_path):
                    url = "{0}/{1}.tar.gz".format(self.mason_repository, slug) # [1] Construct download URL
                    print("[Mason] Downloading package " + url)
                    urlretrieve(url, cache_path) # [2] Download without integrity check
                print("[Mason] Unpacking package to "+ relative_path + "...")
                os.makedirs(install_path)
                tar = tarfile.open(cache_path) # [3] Open downloaded archive
                tar.extractall(install_path) # [4] Extract archive without security checks
                tar.close()
            ...
    ```
    Steps:
    1. The code constructs the URL for downloading the package archive from `self.mason_repository`.
    2. `urlretrieve` downloads the file from the URL to `cache_path`. There is no integrity check performed during or after the download.
    3. `tarfile.open` opens the downloaded archive file.
    4. `tar.extractall` extracts all files from the archive to the `install_path`. This extraction process does not include any checks to prevent extraction of malicious files or scripts.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Server:** Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` module). This server will act as a compromised `mason_repository`. Let's say it runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Package:**
       - Create a directory structure that mimics a Mason package, e.g., `test-package/0.1.0`.
       - Inside this directory, create a malicious file, e.g., `evil.sh` with content: `#!/bin/bash\n touch /tmp/pwned`. Make it executable: `chmod +x evil.sh`.
       - Create a `mason.ini` file inside `test-package/0.1.0` with necessary metadata.
       - Create a tar.gz archive of the `test-package` directory: `tar -czvf malicious_package.tar.gz test-package`.
       - Place `malicious_package.tar.gz` in the malicious server's root directory, accessible at `http://localhost:8000/headers/test-package/0.1.0.tar.gz`.
    3. **Modify `mason_repository`:** In `/code/build_scripts/mason.py`, temporarily change `self.mason_repository = "https://mason-binaries.s3.amazonaws.com"` to `self.mason_repository = "http://localhost:8000"`.
    4. **Run Installation:** In the `/code` directory, run `pip install .` or `pip install -e .`.
    5. **Trigger Malicious Package Use:** Modify `setup.py` to use the malicious package. For example, in `setup.py`, add `mason.use("test-package", "0.1.0", header_only=True)` before `includes.extend(mason.includes("boost"))`. Then `includes.extend(mason.includes("test-package"))`.
    6. **Verify Exploitation:** After running `pip install .`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If it does, the malicious code from `evil.sh` has been executed during the package extraction, demonstrating the vulnerability.
