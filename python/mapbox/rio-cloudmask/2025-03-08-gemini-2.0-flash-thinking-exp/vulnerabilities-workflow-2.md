## Combined Vulnerability List

### Potential Integer Overflow leading to Buffer Overflow in `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter` due to excessively large filter size

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can execute the `rio cloudmask` command providing multiple raster image files as input.
    2. The attacker specifies a very large integer value for the `--max-filter` parameter via the command line interface, intending to influence the size of the maximum filter applied during cloud masking. For example, `--max-filter 4294967295` (maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer, or even larger if allowed).
    3. The `rio cloudmask` script passes this integer value directly to the `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter` function as the `size` argument, after converting it to a tuple.
    4. If `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter` or underlying C/Fortran routines do not properly handle or validate extremely large filter sizes, and if the size calculations within `scipy.ndimage` lead to an integer overflow, it could result in the allocation of a smaller-than-expected buffer.
    5. Subsequently, when `maximum_filter` attempts to process the input raster data using this undersized buffer, it could write beyond the allocated buffer boundaries, leading to a buffer overflow.
    6. This buffer overflow can cause memory corruption, potentially leading to a crash of the `rio cloudmask` process, or in more severe scenarios, arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted by an attacker.
- **Impact:**
    - Memory corruption: A buffer overflow in `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter` can corrupt program memory.
    - Crash: The application may crash due to memory corruption.
    - Potential code execution: Although less likely, in highly specific circumstances and with further exploitation, arbitrary code execution might be possible if an attacker can precisely control the overflow. More realistically, the impact is limited to denial of service through crashing the application.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None: The current code does not implement any explicit input validation or sanitization for the `--max-filter` parameter to limit its size or check for potential overflow conditions before passing it to `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter`. It relies on the underlying libraries to handle potentially very large filter sizes safely.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Implement validation for the `--max-filter` and `--min-filter` parameters in `rio_cloudmask/scripts/cli.py`. This validation should restrict the maximum allowed value for these parameters to a reasonable limit that is safe for `scipy.ndimage.filters` and prevents potential integer overflows or excessive memory allocation. A practical upper bound for filter size should be determined based on typical image sizes and computational resources.
    - Error Handling: Enhance error handling around the calls to `scipy.ndimage.filters`. While validation is the primary mitigation, having robust error handling can help gracefully manage unexpected issues if they arise.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `rio cloudmask` command-line tool.
    - The attacker needs to provide valid raster image files that `rasterio` can successfully open as input bands (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1).
    - The attacker must be able to specify command-line arguments, specifically control the `--max-filter` parameter and set it to a very large integer value.
- **Source code analysis:**
    1. In `/code/rio_cloudmask/scripts/cli.py`, the `main` function defines `--max-filter` as a `click.option` of type `int`:
       ```python
       @click.option('--max-filter', default=25, type=int,
                     help="grow cloud mask around edges by max_filter pixels")
       ```
    2. The integer value provided by the user for `--max-filter` is directly used to create the `max_filter` tuple:
       ```python
       if max_filter == 0:
           max_filter = None
       else:
           # 2d shape implied
           max_filter = (max_filter, max_filter)
       ```
    3. This `max_filter` tuple is then passed as the `size` argument to the `cloudmask` function in `/code/rio_cloudmask/equations.py`:
       ```python
       pcl, pcsl = cloudmask(*arrs, min_filter=min_filter, max_filter=max_filter)
       ```
    4. In `/code/rio_cloudmask/equations.py`, the `cloudmask` function uses this `max_filter` value directly in calls to `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter`:
       ```python
       if max_filter:
           ...
           from scipy.ndimage.filters import maximum_filter
           ...
           pcloud = maximum_filter(pcloud, size=max_filter)
           pshadow = maximum_filter(pshadow, size=max_filter)
       ```
    5. There is no explicit check or validation on the size of `max_filter` before it's passed to `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter`. If a sufficiently large integer is provided, and if `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter` or its underlying implementations are vulnerable to integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes based on the `size` parameter, a buffer overflow could occur.
- **Security test case:**
    1. Set up a test environment with `rio-cloudmask` installed and all dependencies, including `rasterio` and `scipy`.
    2. Create a test directory, e.g., `test_cloudmask_overflow`.
    3. Inside `test_cloudmask_overflow`, create 8 small, valid GeoTIFF files representing Landsat 8 bands (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1). These can be very small, for example, 10x10 pixels with valid TOA reflectance values. Use `rasterio` Python API or `gdal_translate` to create these files with `.tif` extension. Example content for each band file can be a small 2D numpy array filled with representative reflectance values (between 0 and 1) and brightness temperature for tirs1 (around 300K converted to Celsius). Ensure the GeoTIFF files are valid and readable by `rasterio`.
    4. Open a terminal, navigate to the `test_cloudmask_overflow` directory.
    5. Execute the `rio cloudmask` command with the created test GeoTIFF files as input, and set `--max-filter` to a very large integer value, close to the maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer or even larger if your system supports it. For example:
       ```bash
       rio cloudmask band_blue.tif band_green.tif band_red.tif band_nir.tif band_swir1.tif band_swir2.tif band_cirrus.tif band_tirs1.tif -o output_mask.tif --max-filter 4294967295
       ```
       Replace `band_blue.tif`, `band_green.tif`, etc., with the actual filenames you created.
    6. Monitor the execution of the command. Observe if the process crashes, if there are any error messages related to memory allocation or buffer overflows, or if the command hangs or consumes excessive resources. Check system logs for any crash reports or relevant error messages.
    7. If the command crashes with a segmentation fault, memory error, or similar error indicating memory corruption, or if it produces unexpected error messages from `scipy.ndimage`, it provides evidence of a potential vulnerability related to excessively large filter sizes.

### GDAL Image Parsing Vulnerability via Rasterio

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious raster image file (e.g., TIFF, GeoTIFF) that exploits a known or unknown vulnerability in GDAL's image parsing logic.
  2. The attacker provides this malicious image file as input to the `rio cloudmask` command, specifically as one of the input band files (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1).
  3. The `rio cloudmask` command uses Rasterio to open and read the provided image files. Rasterio, in turn, relies on GDAL to parse the image file format.
  4. When GDAL parses the malicious image file, the vulnerability is triggered. This could be a buffer overflow, heap corruption, or another type of memory corruption vulnerability.
  5. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio cloudmask`.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could gain complete control over the system running `rio cloudmask`.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
  - None in `rio-cloudmask` project itself. The project relies on the security of Rasterio and GDAL.
- **Missing mitigations:**
  - Input validation: `rio-cloudmask` does not perform any explicit validation of the input raster files beyond checking if the files exist. It relies on Rasterio and GDAL to handle file parsing safely. However, robust input validation is difficult for complex file formats like GeoTIFF.
  - Dependency updates: Regularly updating Rasterio and GDAL to the latest versions is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities. The project should have processes in place to ensure that its dependencies are kept up-to-date.
  - Sandboxing/Isolation: Running `rio cloudmask` in a sandboxed environment or container could limit the impact of a successful exploit by restricting the permissions and access of the process.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious raster image file as input to the `rio cloudmask` command.
  - The system running `rio cloudmask` must be vulnerable to the GDAL vulnerability exploited by the malicious image. This depends on the GDAL version installed on the system.
- **Source code analysis:**
  - File: `/code/rio_cloudmask/scripts/cli.py`
  ```python
  @click.command('cloudmask')
  @click.argument('blue', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('green', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('red', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('nir', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('swir1', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('swir2', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('cirrus', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('tirs1', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  ...
  def main(ctx, dst_dtype, output, creation_options,
           blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1,
           min_filter, max_filter):
      ...
      arrs = [rasterio.open(path).read(1)
              for path in (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1)]
      ...
  ```
    - The `main` function in `cli.py` defines command-line arguments for input raster files (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1).
    - It uses `rasterio.open(path)` to open each input file provided by the user.
    - `rasterio.open()` internally calls GDAL to handle the reading and parsing of raster image formats.
    - If a malicious raster image, crafted to exploit a GDAL vulnerability, is provided as any of the input file paths, the `rasterio.open()` call will pass the file to GDAL for processing.
    - If GDAL is vulnerable to parsing this specific malicious file, it could trigger a vulnerability during the parsing process.
    - This vulnerability could lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
- **Security test case:**
  1. **Identify a GDAL vulnerability:** Search for known GDAL vulnerabilities related to image parsing, especially those that can lead to remote code execution. Check public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for GDAL vulnerabilities. If a suitable vulnerability is found, obtain a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit or create a malicious image that triggers it. If no public vulnerability is readily available, one could attempt to trigger potential vulnerabilities through fuzzing GDAL with various malformed raster files, although this is more advanced.
  2. **Craft a malicious raster image:** Using the identified vulnerability details or PoC, craft a malicious raster image file (e.g., `malicious.tif`). This might involve manipulating specific header fields, data structures, or embedded data within a supported raster format (like TIFF, GeoTIFF, PNG, etc.) to trigger a parsing error in GDAL that leads to code execution.
  3. **Set up a test environment:** Install `rio-cloudmask` and a vulnerable version of GDAL. It is important to use a GDAL version known to be affected by the chosen vulnerability. You might need to compile GDAL from source to use a specific vulnerable version.
  4. **Execute `rio cloudmask` with the malicious image:** Run the `rio cloudmask` command, providing the `malicious.tif` file as input for one of the band arguments. For example, if the vulnerability is triggered when parsing a TIFF file provided as the blue band:
     ```bash
     rio cloudmask malicious.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B3_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B4_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B5_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B6_toa.tif tests/data/LC8013031205LGN00_B7_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B9_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B10_toa.tif -o output.tif
     ```
  5. **Observe system behavior:** Monitor the execution of the `rio cloudmask` command. A successful exploit might result in:
     - **Crash:** The program terminates unexpectedly due to a segmentation fault or other error, indicating memory corruption.
     - **Unexpected behavior:** The program might exhibit unusual behavior, such as writing unexpected files, making network connections, or modifying system settings.
     - **Code execution:** In a successful scenario, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code. This could be verified by attempting to perform an action like creating a file in a specific location, spawning a shell, or making a network request to a controlled server from within the context of the `rio cloudmask` process.
  6. **Analyze results:** If the test results in a crash, unexpected behavior, or code execution, it confirms the GDAL image parsing vulnerability is exploitable through `rio-cloudmask`. Document the steps, observations, and evidence of successful exploitation.
