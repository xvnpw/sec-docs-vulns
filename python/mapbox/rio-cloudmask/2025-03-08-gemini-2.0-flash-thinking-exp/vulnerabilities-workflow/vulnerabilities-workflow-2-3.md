### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: GDAL Image Parsing Vulnerability via Rasterio

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious raster image file (e.g., TIFF, GeoTIFF) that exploits a known or unknown vulnerability in GDAL's image parsing logic.
  2. The attacker provides this malicious image file as input to the `rio cloudmask` command, specifically as one of the input band files (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1).
  3. The `rio cloudmask` command uses Rasterio to open and read the provided image files. Rasterio, in turn, relies on GDAL to parse the image file format.
  4. When GDAL parses the malicious image file, the vulnerability is triggered. This could be a buffer overflow, heap corruption, or another type of memory corruption vulnerability.
  5. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running `rio cloudmask`.

- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could gain complete control over the system running `rio cloudmask`.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in `rio-cloudmask` project itself. The project relies on the security of Rasterio and GDAL.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation: `rio-cloudmask` does not perform any explicit validation of the input raster files beyond checking if the files exist. It relies on Rasterio and GDAL to handle file parsing safely. However, robust input validation is difficult for complex file formats like GeoTIFF.
  - Dependency updates: Regularly updating Rasterio and GDAL to the latest versions is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities. The project should have processes in place to ensure that its dependencies are kept up-to-date.
  - Sandboxing/Isolation: Running `rio cloudmask` in a sandboxed environment or container could limit the impact of a successful exploit by restricting the permissions and access of the process.

- Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious raster image file as input to the `rio cloudmask` command.
  - The system running `rio cloudmask` must be vulnerable to the GDAL vulnerability exploited by the malicious image. This depends on the GDAL version installed on the system.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/rio_cloudmask/scripts/cli.py`
  ```python
  @click.command('cloudmask')
  @click.argument('blue', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('green', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('red', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('nir', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('swir1', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('swir2', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('cirrus', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  @click.argument('tirs1', type=click.Path(exists=True))
  ...
  def main(ctx, dst_dtype, output, creation_options,
           blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1,
           min_filter, max_filter):
      ...
      arrs = [rasterio.open(path).read(1)
              for path in (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1)]
      ...
  ```
    - The `main` function in `cli.py` defines command-line arguments for input raster files (blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, cirrus, tirs1).
    - It uses `rasterio.open(path)` to open each input file provided by the user.
    - `rasterio.open()` internally calls GDAL to handle the reading and parsing of raster image formats.
    - If a malicious raster image, crafted to exploit a GDAL vulnerability, is provided as any of the input file paths, the `rasterio.open()` call will pass the file to GDAL for processing.
    - If GDAL is vulnerable to parsing this specific malicious file, it could trigger a vulnerability during the parsing process.
    - This vulnerability could lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Identify a GDAL vulnerability:** Search for known GDAL vulnerabilities related to image parsing, especially those that can lead to remote code execution. Check public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for GDAL vulnerabilities. If a suitable vulnerability is found, obtain a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit or create a malicious image that triggers it. If no public vulnerability is readily available, one could attempt to trigger potential vulnerabilities through fuzzing GDAL with various malformed raster files, although this is more advanced.
  2. **Craft a malicious raster image:** Using the identified vulnerability details or PoC, craft a malicious raster image file (e.g., `malicious.tif`). This might involve manipulating specific header fields, data structures, or embedded data within a supported raster format (like TIFF, GeoTIFF, PNG, etc.) to trigger a parsing error in GDAL that leads to code execution.
  3. **Set up a test environment:** Install `rio-cloudmask` and a vulnerable version of GDAL. It is important to use a GDAL version known to be affected by the chosen vulnerability. You might need to compile GDAL from source to use a specific vulnerable version.
  4. **Execute `rio cloudmask` with the malicious image:** Run the `rio cloudmask` command, providing the `malicious.tif` file as input for one of the band arguments. For example, if the vulnerability is triggered when parsing a TIFF file provided as the blue band:
     ```bash
     rio cloudmask malicious.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B3_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B4_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B5_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B6_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B7_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B9_toa.tif tests/data/LC80130312015295LGN00_B10_toa.tif -o output.tif
     ```
  5. **Observe system behavior:** Monitor the execution of the `rio cloudmask` command. A successful exploit might result in:
     - **Crash:** The program terminates unexpectedly due to a segmentation fault or other error, indicating memory corruption.
     - **Unexpected behavior:** The program might exhibit unusual behavior, such as writing unexpected files, making network connections, or modifying system settings.
     - **Code execution:** In a successful scenario, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code. This could be verified by attempting to perform an action like creating a file in a specific location, spawning a shell, or making a network request to a controlled server from within the context of the `rio cloudmask` process.
  6. **Analyze results:** If the test results in a crash, unexpected behavior, or code execution, it confirms the GDAL image parsing vulnerability is exploitable through `rio-cloudmask`. Document the steps, observations, and evidence of successful exploitation.

This vulnerability is inherent in the design of applications that process external data formats using libraries like GDAL and Rasterio. While `rio-cloudmask` code itself may not introduce the vulnerability, it acts as a pathway for exploiting vulnerabilities present in its dependencies when processing malicious input data.
