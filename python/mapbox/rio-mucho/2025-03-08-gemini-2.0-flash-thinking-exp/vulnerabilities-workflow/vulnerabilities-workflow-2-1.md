- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Input File Paths
- Description:
    - An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability by providing maliciously crafted input file paths to the `rio-mucho` library.
    - The vulnerability occurs because the `rio-mucho` library directly uses user-provided file paths as input to the `rasterio.open` function without proper validation or sanitization.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. A user (attacker) provides a list of input file paths to the `RioMucho` class during initialization. This list can contain malicious paths, such as paths with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_file`).
        2. The `RioMucho` class initializes a worker pool.
        3. In the worker initialization function (`init_worker`), the provided input paths are directly passed to `rasterio.open()` to open raster datasets.
        4. `rasterio.open()` attempts to open the files at the provided paths, including any maliciously crafted paths with traversal sequences.
        5. If a malicious path like `../../sensitive_file` is provided, `rasterio.open()` will attempt to open a file outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized file access.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized File Access: An attacker could read sensitive files from the file system that the `rio-mucho` process has access to. This could include configuration files, data files, or other sensitive information, depending on the deployment context and file system permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly passes user-provided file paths to `rasterio.open` without any validation or sanitization. There are no explicit checks or sanitization routines in the provided code to prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path validation and sanitization: The library should validate and sanitize input file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. This could include:
        - Validating that paths are absolute or relative to a defined safe base directory.
        - Sanitizing paths to remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences like `..`.
        - Using secure file path handling functions provided by the operating system or libraries to prevent traversal.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control or influence the input file paths that are passed to the `rio-mucho` library. This could occur in scenarios where:
        - The `rio-mucho` library is used in an application that takes user-provided file paths as input (e.g., a web service, command-line tool).
        - Input file paths are read from an external configuration file or database that can be manipulated by an attacker.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/riomucho/__init__.py`
    - Function: `init_worker(inpaths, g_args)`
    ```python
    def init_worker(inpaths, g_args):
        """The multiprocessing worker initializer

        Parameters
        ----------
        inpaths : list of str
            A list of dataset paths.
        g_args : dict
            Global arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        None

        """
        global global_args
        global srcs
        global_args = g_args
        srcs = [rasterio.open(i) for i in inpaths] # Vulnerable line
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** The line `srcs = [rasterio.open(i) for i in inpaths]` is the source of the vulnerability.
    - **Explanation:**
        - The `inpaths` argument to `init_worker` is directly derived from the `inpaths` argument passed to the `RioMucho` class constructor. This `inpaths` in `RioMucho` constructor is intended to be provided by the user of the library.
        - The code iterates through each path `i` in the `inpaths` list and directly calls `rasterio.open(i)`.
        - `rasterio.open()` function, when given a file path, attempts to open the file at that exact path. It does not perform any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.
        - If an attacker provides a path like `../../sensitive_file` in the `inpaths` list, `rasterio.open()` will attempt to open the file `sensitive_file` located two directories up from the current working directory of the `rio-mucho` process.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (inpaths) --> RioMucho Class --> init_worker Function --> rasterio.open(path) --> File System Access
        Malicious Path (e.g., "../../sensitive_file") --------^
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a test directory, e.g., `test_riomucho_path_traversal`.
        - Inside `test_riomucho_path_traversal`, create a subdirectory `input_data`.
        - Inside `test_riomucho_path_traversal`, create a sensitive file named `sensitive.txt` with content "This is sensitive data.".
        - Inside `test_riomucho_path_traversal/input_data`, create a dummy GeoTIFF file named `dummy.tif`. You can use `rasterio` to create a minimal valid GeoTIFF:
          ```python
          import rasterio
          import numpy as np
          from rasterio.profiles import default_gtiff_profile

          profile = default_gtiff_profile
          profile.update(dtype=rasterio.uint8, count=1, width=100, height=100)
          with rasterio.open('test_riomucho_path_traversal/input_data/dummy.tif', 'w', **profile) as dst:
              dst.write(np.zeros((100, 100), dtype=rasterio.uint8), 1)
          ```
        - Create an output file path, e.g., `output.tif` inside `test_riomucho_path_traversal`.

    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the following Python script within the `test_riomucho_path_traversal` directory:
          ```python
          import riomucho
          import rasterio
          import os

          def dummy_run_function(data, window, ij, g_args):
              return data[0] # Just return input data

          input_paths = ['input_data/dummy.tif', '../../sensitive.txt'] # Malicious path: traversal to sensitive.txt
          output_path = 'output.tif'
          options = {'driver': 'GTiff', 'height': 100, 'width': 100, 'count': 1, 'dtype': rasterio.uint8}

          try:
              with riomucho.RioMucho(input_paths, output_path, dummy_run_function, options=options) as rm:
                  rm.run(1)
              print("RioMucho execution completed. Check for errors and file access.")
          except rasterio.errors.RasterioIOError as e:
              print(f"Expected RasterioIOError caught, indicating attempted access to non-raster file (sensitive.txt): {e}")
          except Exception as e:
              print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

          # Optional: Attempt to read sensitive.txt after the run (this will likely fail due to RasterioIOError during riomucho execution)
          try:
              with open('sensitive.txt', 'r') as f:
                  content = f.read()
                  print(f"\nAttempted to read sensitive.txt directly after riomucho run:\nContent: {content}") # Should print content if accessible directly
          except Exception as e_read:
              print(f"\nCould not read sensitive.txt directly after riomucho run (expected): {e_read}")

          print("\nTest finished.")
          ```

    3. **Verification:**
        - **Expected Output:** The script execution should print a `RasterioIOError`. This error is expected because `rio-mucho` (via `rasterio.open`) will attempt to open `../../sensitive.txt` as a raster file, which it is not. The error message in `RasterioIOError` will likely indicate that `rasterio` failed to open `../../sensitive.txt` or the resolved path (e.g., `<...>/test_riomucho_path_traversal/sensitive.txt`) because it's not a valid raster file.
        - **Successful Exploitation Proof:** Even though `RasterioIOError` is raised, it confirms that `rio-mucho` *attempted* to open and process the file at the traversed path (`../../sensitive.txt`). This attempt to open an arbitrary file outside the intended input directory, based on user-controlled input, demonstrates the path traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability is proven by the *attempt* to access the file, not necessarily by successfully reading raster data from it (which will fail in this case as `sensitive.txt` is not a raster file).
        - **Absence of Mitigation:** The test confirms the absence of path validation in `rio-mucho`. If mitigations were in place, `rio-mucho` would have either rejected the malicious path outright or handled file opening in a way that prevents traversal outside of allowed directories.
