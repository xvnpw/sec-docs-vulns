### Vulnerability List:

* **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Input Paths
* **Description:**
    If an application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided input paths to be passed directly to the `inputs` argument of the `RioMucho` class without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft malicious input paths to read arbitrary files on the system.
    For example, an attacker could provide an input path like `/etc/passwd` or `../../sensitive_file.txt`.
    When `rio-mucho` processes these paths, it uses `rasterio.open()` to open the files, which, without sanitization, will lead to reading files outside the intended input directory.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker identifies an application using `rio-mucho` that takes user-provided file paths as input for raster processing.
    2. The attacker provides a malicious input path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_file.txt`) as one of the `inputs` to the `RioMucho` constructor.
    3. The application passes this unsanitized input path to `rio-mucho`.
    4. `rio-mucho`'s `RioMucho` class initializes and in the `init_worker` function, `rasterio.open()` is called on the malicious path.
    5. `rasterio.open()` opens the file at the attacker-specified path, potentially reading sensitive files outside the intended directory.
* **Impact:**
    An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system that the application has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses user-provided paths with `rasterio.open()` without any sanitization.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    Input path sanitization should be implemented to prevent path traversal. This could involve:
    - Validating input paths against a whitelist of allowed directories.
    - Using secure path manipulation functions to resolve paths and ensure they stay within the intended directory.
    - Removing or escaping path traversal sequences like `..`.
* **Preconditions:**
    - An application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided input paths to be passed to the `inputs` argument of the `RioMucho` class.
    - The application does not sanitize the input paths before passing them to `rio-mucho`.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `RioMucho` class `__init__` method, the `inpaths` argument is directly assigned to `self.inpaths`.
    ```python
    class RioMucho(object):
        def __init__(
            self,
            inpaths, # user controlled input paths
            outpath_or_dataset,
            run_function,
            mode="simple_read",
            windows=None,
            options=None,
            global_args=None,
        ):
            self.inpaths = inpaths # Storing input paths without sanitization
            ...
    ```
    2. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `init_worker` function, `rasterio.open()` is used to open each path in `inpaths` without any validation or sanitization.
    ```python
    def init_worker(inpaths, g_args):
        ...
        srcs = [rasterio.open(i) for i in inpaths] # Opening user provided paths directly
        ...
    ```
    3. `rasterio.open()` function from the `rasterio` library will directly open the file path provided, including paths with traversal sequences like `..`.
* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a directory `/tmp/test_rio_mucho_input` and put a valid GeoTIFF file named `input1.tif` inside it. Also, create a sensitive file `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` outside this directory.
    2. **Script:** Create a python script `test_input_traversal.py`:
    ```python
    import riomucho
    import rasterio

    def read_function_simple(data, window, ij, g_args):
        return data[0]

    input_dir = "/tmp/test_rio_mucho_input"
    output_path = "/tmp/test_output.tif"
    sensitive_file_path = "../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt" # Path traversal to sensitive file

    # Create dummy sensitive data file
    with open("/tmp/sensitive_data.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("This is sensitive information.")

    # Use path traversal in input paths
    input_paths = [sensitive_file_path, f"{input_dir}/input1.tif"]

    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho(
            input_paths,
            output_path,
            read_function_simple
        ) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print("RioMucho run completed (potentially vulnerable)")
    except rasterio.errors.RasterioIOError as e:
        if "sensitive_data.txt" in str(e):
            print("Vulnerability confirmed: Attempted to open sensitive_data.txt")
        else:
            print(f"RioMucho run failed with RasterioIOError: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RioMucho run failed with error: {e}")

    # Cleanup dummy sensitive data file
    import os
    os.remove("/tmp/sensitive_data.txt")

    ```
    3. **Run:** Execute the script `python test_input_traversal.py` from a location such that `../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt` correctly resolves to `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt`.
    4. **Observe:** If the output is "Vulnerability confirmed: Attempted to open sensitive_data.txt", it indicates that `rasterio.open()` attempted to open the sensitive file due to path traversal in the input path, confirming the vulnerability.

* **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Output Path
* **Description:**
    If an application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided output paths to be passed directly to the `output` argument of the `RioMucho` class without sanitization, an attacker could craft a malicious output path to write files to arbitrary locations on the system.
    For example, an attacker could provide an output path like `/tmp/malicious_output.tif` to write to `/tmp` directory regardless of intended output directory or `/etc/cron.d/malicious_job` if the application has write permissions to `/etc/cron.d`.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker identifies an application using `rio-mucho` that takes user-provided file paths as output for raster processing.
    2. The attacker provides a malicious output path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../malicious_output.tif`) or an absolute path to a sensitive directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_output.tif`) as the `output` to the `RioMucho` constructor.
    3. The application passes this unsanitized output path to `rio-mucho`.
    4. `rio-mucho`'s `RioMucho` class initializes and in the `run` method, `rasterio.open()` is called with write mode on the malicious output path.
    5. `rasterio.open()` opens the file at the attacker-specified path in write mode, allowing the attacker to write files outside the intended output directory.
* **Impact:**
    An attacker can write arbitrary files to the system that the application has write access to. This can lead to system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses user-provided paths with `rasterio.open()` without any sanitization.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    Output path sanitization is crucial to prevent arbitrary file writes. Mitigations include:
    - Validating the output path against a whitelist of allowed directories.
    - Ensuring the output path is within the intended output directory.
    - Preventing path traversal sequences in the output path.
* **Preconditions:**
    - An application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided output paths to be passed to the `output` argument of the `RioMucho` class.
    - The application does not sanitize the output path before passing it to `rio-mucho`.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `RioMucho` class `__init__` method, the `outpath_or_dataset` argument is directly assigned to `self.outpath_or_dataset`.
    ```python
    class RioMucho(object):
        def __init__(
            self,
            inpaths,
            outpath_or_dataset, # user controlled output path
            run_function,
            mode="simple_read",
            windows=None,
            options=None,
            global_args=None,
        ):
            self.outpath_or_dataset = outpath_or_dataset # Storing output path without sanitization
            ...
    ```
    2. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `run` method, `rasterio.open()` is used to open the `self.outpath_or_dataset` in write mode without any validation or sanitization.
    ```python
    class RioMucho(object):
        ...
        def run(self, processes=4):
            ...
            if isinstance(self.outpath_or_dataset, rasterio.io.DatasetWriter):
                destination = self.outpath_or_dataset
            else:
                destination = rasterio.open(self.outpath_or_dataset, "w", **self.options) # Opening user provided output path directly in write mode
            ...
    ```
    3. `rasterio.open(..., "w", ...)` function from the `rasterio` library will directly open the file path provided in write mode, including paths with traversal sequences like `..` or absolute paths.
* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a directory `/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended` which is the intended output directory.
    2. **Script:** Create a python script `test_output_traversal.py`:
    ```python
    import riomucho
    import rasterio
    import os

    def read_function_simple(data, window, ij, g_args):
        return data[0]

    input_path = "/tmp/test_1.tif" # Assuming test_1.tif exists from conftest.py or create a dummy one
    output_dir_intended = "/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended"
    output_path_traversal = "../../../tmp/malicious_output.tif" # Path traversal to write outside intended dir
    output_path_absolute = "/tmp/malicious_output_abs.tif" # Absolute path to write outside intended dir

    # Ensure intended output dir exists
    os.makedirs(output_dir_intended, exist_ok=True)

    # Test path traversal output
    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho(
            [input_path],
            output_path_traversal, # Using path traversal in output path
            read_function_simple
        ) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print(f"RioMucho run with traversal output completed (potentially vulnerable). Check for file in /tmp/malicious_output.tif")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RioMucho run with traversal output failed with error: {e}")

    # Test absolute path output
    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho(
            [input_path],
            output_path_absolute, # Using absolute path in output path
            read_function_simple
        ) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print(f"RioMucho run with absolute output completed (potentially vulnerable). Check for file in /tmp/malicious_output_abs.tif")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RioMucho run with absolute output failed with error: {e}")
    ```
    3. **Run:** Execute the script `python test_output_traversal.py` from a location such that `../../../tmp/malicious_output.tif` correctly resolves to `/tmp/malicious_output.tif`. Ensure `test_1.tif` exists at `/tmp/test_1.tif` or replace with a valid input raster path.
    4. **Observe:** Check if `malicious_output.tif` and `malicious_output_abs.tif` files are created in the `/tmp` directory. If these files are created in `/tmp` instead of the intended output directory `/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended`, it confirms the path traversal and arbitrary write vulnerability.
