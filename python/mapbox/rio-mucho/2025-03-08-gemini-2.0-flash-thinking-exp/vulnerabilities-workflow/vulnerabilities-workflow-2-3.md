Okay, I understand the instructions. Please provide the list of vulnerabilities.

Once you provide the list, I will go through each vulnerability and filter them based on these criteria:

**Inclusion Criteria:**

*   **Valid vulnerability:** Must be a genuine security issue.
*   **Part of attack vector:**  Must be exploitable through a malicious raster file processed by `rio-mucho` and related to `rasterio` or underlying image processing libraries.

**Exclusion Criteria:**

*   **Documentation-only mitigation:** Vulnerabilities that are just missing documentation to prevent them.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Vulnerabilities that only lead to DoS.
*   **Unrealistic exploit:** Vulnerabilities that are not practically exploitable in a real-world scenario by an attacker.
*   **Incomplete description:** Vulnerabilities that lack sufficient detail, such as missing source code analysis or a security test case to verify them.
*   **Theoretical only:** Vulnerabilities that are only theoretical without evidence of exploitability in the code.
*   **Low or medium severity:** Vulnerabilities that are not ranked as high or critical severity.

For each vulnerability that meets the inclusion criteria and does *not* meet any of the exclusion criteria, I will present it in the following markdown format:

```markdown
- **Vulnerability Name:** [Vulnerability Name]
  - **Description:** [Detailed step-by-step description of how to trigger the vulnerability using a malicious raster file and rio-mucho/rasterio]
  - **Impact:** [Description of the impact of the vulnerability, e.g., arbitrary code execution, data breach, etc.]
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** [high/critical]
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** [Describe any mitigations currently in place within rio-mucho or rasterio that partially or fully address this vulnerability. If none, state "None".]
  - **Missing Mitigations:** [Describe what mitigations are missing in rio-mucho to fully address this vulnerability. Focus on code-level mitigations, not just documentation.]
  - **Preconditions:** [Describe any specific preconditions that must be met for the vulnerability to be triggered, e.g., specific file formats, library versions, system configurations.]
  - **Source Code Analysis:** [Provide a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the relevant source code in rio-mucho, rasterio, or underlying libraries, explaining how the vulnerability can be triggered. Include code snippets and explain the flow of execution leading to the vulnerability. Visualize if helpful.]
  - **Security Test Case:** [Describe a step-by-step security test case that an external attacker could perform on a publicly accessible instance using rio-mucho to demonstrate the vulnerability. Be specific about the malicious raster file and steps to trigger the vulnerability.]
```

If no vulnerabilities from your list meet these criteria, I will return an empty list.

**Please provide the vulnerability list so I can begin processing it.**
