- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Input File Paths
  - **Description:**
    An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability by providing maliciously crafted input file paths to the `rio-mucho` library. The vulnerability arises because `rio-mucho` directly uses user-provided file paths as input to the `rasterio.open` function without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to read files outside the intended directory.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker provides a list of input file paths to the `RioMucho` class during initialization. This list contains malicious paths with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_file`).
    2. The `RioMucho` class initializes a worker pool.
    3. In the worker initialization function (`init_worker`), the provided input paths are directly passed to `rasterio.open()` to open raster datasets.
    4. `rasterio.open()` attempts to open files at the provided paths, including the malicious path `../../sensitive_file`.
    5. `rasterio.open()` opens a file outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized file access.
  - **Impact:**
    Unauthorized File Access: An attacker can read sensitive files from the file system that the `rio-mucho` process has access to. This could include configuration files, data files, or other sensitive information.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly passes user-provided file paths to `rasterio.open` without any validation or sanitization.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    Input path validation and sanitization: The library should validate and sanitize input file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. Recommended mitigations include:
        - Validating that paths are absolute or relative to a defined safe base directory.
        - Sanitizing paths to remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences like `..`.
        - Using secure file path handling functions to prevent traversal.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to control or influence the input file paths that are passed to the `rio-mucho` library. This is possible when:
        - `rio-mucho` is used in an application that takes user-provided file paths as input (e.g., a web service, command-line tool).
        - Input file paths are read from an external configuration file or database that can be manipulated by an attacker.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/riomucho/__init__.py` (or `riomucho/__init__.py` in provided examples)
    - Function: `init_worker(inpaths, g_args)`
    ```python
    def init_worker(inpaths, g_args):
        """The multiprocessing worker initializer"""
        global global_args
        global srcs
        global_args = g_args
        srcs = [rasterio.open(i) for i in inpaths] # Vulnerable line
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the line `srcs = [rasterio.open(i) for i in inpaths]`. The `inpaths` argument, derived from user-controlled input, is directly passed to `rasterio.open()`. `rasterio.open()` opens the file at the exact path provided without any sanitization.  If a malicious path like `../../sensitive_file` is provided, `rasterio.open()` will attempt to open that file, leading to path traversal.
    ```
    User Input (inpaths) --> RioMucho Class --> init_worker Function --> rasterio.open(path) --> File System Access
    Malicious Path (e.g., "../../sensitive_file") ----------------^
    ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a directory `test_riomucho_path_traversal`. Inside it, create `input_data` subdirectory and a sensitive file `sensitive.txt` with content "This is sensitive data.". Inside `input_data`, create a dummy GeoTIFF file `dummy.tif`. Create an output file path `output.tif` inside `test_riomucho_path_traversal`.
    2. **Execution:** Run the following Python script within `test_riomucho_path_traversal`:
    ```python
    import riomucho
    import rasterio
    import os

    def dummy_run_function(data, window, ij, g_args):
        return data[0]

    input_paths = ['input_data/dummy.tif', '../../sensitive.txt'] # Malicious path
    output_path = 'output.tif'
    options = {'driver': 'GTiff', 'height': 100, 'width': 100, 'count': 1, 'dtype': rasterio.uint8}

    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho(input_paths, output_path, dummy_run_function, options=options) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print("RioMucho execution completed.")
    except rasterio.errors.RasterioIOError as e:
        print(f"Expected RasterioIOError caught: {e}")

    try:
        with open('sensitive.txt', 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            print(f"\nAttempted to read sensitive.txt directly after riomucho run:\nContent: {content}")
    except Exception as e_read:
        print(f"\nCould not read sensitive.txt directly after riomucho run (expected): {e_read}")

    print("\nTest finished.")
    ```
    3. **Verification:** Execute the script. Observe the output. A `RasterioIOError` is expected, indicating that `rio-mucho` attempted to open `../../sensitive.txt` as a raster file and failed. This attempt confirms the path traversal vulnerability, as `rio-mucho` tried to access a file outside the intended input directory based on user-controlled input.


- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Output Path
  - **Description:**
    If an application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided output paths, an attacker can craft a malicious output path to write files to arbitrary locations. This is because `rio-mucho` directly uses the user-provided output path with `rasterio.open` in write mode without sanitization.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker identifies an application using `rio-mucho` that takes user-provided file paths as output.
    2. The attacker provides a malicious output path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../malicious_output.tif`) or an absolute path (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_output.tif`).
    3. The application passes this unsanitized output path to `rio-mucho as the `output` argument.
    4. `rio-mucho` initializes and in the `run` method, calls `rasterio.open()` in write mode on this malicious output path.
    5. `rasterio.open()` opens and writes to the file at the attacker-specified path, potentially writing files outside the intended output directory.
  - **Impact:**
    Arbitrary File Write: An attacker can write arbitrary files to the system that the application has write access to. This can lead to system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses user-provided paths with `rasterio.open()` without any sanitization for output paths.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    Output path sanitization is essential to prevent arbitrary file writes. Mitigations should include:
        - Validating the output path against a whitelist of allowed directories.
        - Ensuring the output path is within the intended output directory.
        - Preventing path traversal sequences in the output path.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An application using `rio-mucho` allows user-provided output paths to be passed to the `output` argument of the `RioMucho` class.
    - The application does not sanitize the output path before passing it to `rio-mucho`.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `RioMucho` class `__init__` method:
    ```python
    class RioMucho(object):
        def __init__(self, inpaths, outpath_or_dataset, run_function, ...):
            self.outpath_or_dataset = outpath_or_dataset # User controlled output path
            ...
    ```
    The `outpath_or_dataset` argument, which can be user-controlled, is directly assigned to `self.outpath_or_dataset` without sanitization.
    2. `riomucho/__init__.py`: In the `run` method:
    ```python
    class RioMucho(object):
        def run(self, processes=4):
            ...
            if isinstance(self.outpath_or_dataset, rasterio.io.DatasetWriter):
                destination = self.outpath_or_dataset
            else:
                destination = rasterio.open(self.outpath_or_dataset, "w", **self.options) # Vulnerable line
            ...
    ```
    The line `destination = rasterio.open(self.outpath_or_dataset, "w", **self.options)` is vulnerable. `self.outpath_or_dataset`, derived from user-controlled input, is directly used as the output path for `rasterio.open()` in write mode (`"w"`). This allows an attacker to control the output file location.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a directory `/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended` as the intended output directory. Ensure a dummy input file `test_1.tif` exists at `/tmp/test_1.tif`.
    2. **Execution:** Create and run the Python script `test_output_traversal.py`:
    ```python
    import riomucho
    import rasterio
    import os

    def read_function_simple(data, window, ij, g_args):
        return data[0]

    input_path = "/tmp/test_1.tif"
    output_dir_intended = "/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended"
    output_path_traversal = "../../../tmp/malicious_output.tif" # Path traversal
    output_path_absolute = "/tmp/malicious_output_abs.tif"   # Absolute path

    os.makedirs(output_dir_intended, exist_ok=True)

    # Test path traversal output
    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho([input_path], output_path_traversal, read_function_simple) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print(f"RioMucho run with traversal output completed. Check for file in /tmp/malicious_output.tif")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RioMucho run with traversal output failed: {e}")

    # Test absolute path output
    try:
        with riomucho.RioMucho([input_path], output_path_absolute, read_function_simple) as rm:
            rm.run(1)
        print(f"RioMucho run with absolute output completed. Check for file in /tmp/malicious_output_abs.tif")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RioMucho run with absolute output failed: {e}")
    ```
    3. **Verification:** Execute the script. Check if `malicious_output.tif` and `malicious_output_abs.tif` files are created in the `/tmp` directory. If these files are created in `/tmp` instead of the intended directory `/tmp/test_rio_mucho_output_intended`, it confirms the path traversal and arbitrary write vulnerability.
