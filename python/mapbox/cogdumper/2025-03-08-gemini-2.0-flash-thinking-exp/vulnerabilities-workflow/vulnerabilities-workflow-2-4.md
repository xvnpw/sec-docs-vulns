### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Path Traversal in `cogdumper http` command

* Description:
    1. The `cogdumper http` command allows users to specify a `--path` argument which is intended to define the path to the GeoTIFF resource on the web server.
    2. The provided `--path` argument is directly incorporated into the URL without any sanitization or validation in the `HTTPReader` class.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious `--path` argument, such as `../../../../`, to traverse directories on the web server and access files outside the intended directory.
    4. For example, if the intended resource is located at `http://example.com/data/cog.tif` and an attacker uses `--path ../../../etc --resource passwd`, the tool might attempt to access `http://example.com/../../../etc/passwd`.
    5. If the web server is misconfigured and allows access to files outside the intended webroot, this path traversal can be successful.

* Impact:
    - An attacker can read arbitrary files from the web server if the web server is misconfigured and the webserver process has sufficient file system permissions.
    - This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, source code, or user data, depending on the server's file system layout and permissions.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly concatenates the user-provided `--path` argument into the URL without any checks or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `--path` argument in the `http` command within `cogdumper/scripts/cli.py` or `cogdumper/httpdumper.py`.
    - Implement proper URL construction, potentially using `urllib.parse.urljoin` and ensuring that the path is treated as a relative path within the intended resource directory on the server.
    - Consider restricting allowed characters in the `--path` argument to prevent traversal attempts.

* Preconditions:
    - A web server hosting COG files is accessible.
    - The web server is misconfigured, allowing the webserver process to access files outside the intended directory.
    - The attacker has knowledge or can guess file paths outside the intended directory on the web server.
    - The COGDumper tool is used with the `http` command and a maliciously crafted `--path` argument.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/cogdumper/httpdumper.py`
    ```python
    class Reader(AbstractReader):
        """Wraps the remote COG."""

        def __init__(self, server, path, resource, user=None, password=None):
            self.server = server
            self.path = path # User-provided path is stored directly
            self.resource = resource
            if path:
                self.url = f'{server}/{path}/{resource}' # Path is directly used in URL construction
            else:
                self.url = f'{server}/{resource}'
            # ... rest of the code ...
    ```
    - The `HTTPReader.__init__` method takes the `path` argument directly from the command line options.
    - It then constructs the URL using an f-string by directly embedding the `path` variable: `f'{server}/{path}/{resource}'`.
    - There is no sanitization or validation of the `path` variable before it is used in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject path traversal sequences like `../` into the URL.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a local HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` module).
    2. Create a directory named `data` in the web server's root directory.
    3. Place a dummy COG file (e.g., `cog.tif`) inside the `data` directory.
    4. Create another file named `sensitive.txt` in the web server's root directory, outside the `data` directory. This file will represent a sensitive file that should not be accessible.
    5. Run the `cogdumper http` command with a malicious `--path` argument to attempt to access `sensitive.txt`. For example:
       ```bash
       cogdumper http --server http://localhost:8000 --path "../" --resource sensitive.txt --xyz 0 0 0
       ```
    6. Observe the output. If the command successfully downloads a file named `http_0_0_0.txt` (or similar) and the content of this file is the same as `sensitive.txt`, then the path traversal vulnerability is confirmed.
    7. Additionally, examine the web server logs to confirm that the server received a request for `http://localhost:8000/../sensitive.txt`.
