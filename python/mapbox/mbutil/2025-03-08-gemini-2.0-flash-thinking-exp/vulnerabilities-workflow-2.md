## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Path Traversal in `disk_to_mbtiles` (MBTiles Import) - Input Directory Path Traversal

* Description:
    1. The `disk_to_mbtiles` function imports tiles from a directory specified by the `directory_path` argument.
    2. The function iterates through subdirectories representing zoom levels and tile rows within the `directory_path`.
    3. For each tile, it constructs the file path by joining `directory_path`, zoom level directory, row directory, and filename using `os.path.join`.
    4. If a malicious `directory_path` like "../../evil_dir" is provided, the `os.path.join` will resolve to a path outside the intended base directory.
    5. Subsequently, when the code attempts to open and read files using the constructed path, it can access files outside the intended directory, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
    6. An attacker can leverage this to read arbitrary files from the server's file system by crafting a malicious input path.

* Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system accessible to the user running the `mb-util` tool. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or data, leading to potential information disclosure and further exploitation.

* Vulnerability Rank:
    - **High**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `directory_path` input. It directly uses the provided path in `os.path.join` for file system operations.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The `directory_path` should be validated to ensure it is a safe path and does not contain path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths pointing outside the intended base directory.
    - Path canonicalization: The input `directory_path` should be canonicalized to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path separators before being used in file system operations. This can help prevent bypasses of naive path traversal checks.
    - Restricting access: The user running `mb-util` should have the least necessary privileges to minimize the impact of a successful path traversal attack.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `mb-util` command with the `disk_to_mbtiles` functionality (import operation).
    - The attacker must be able to control the `input` argument of the `mb-util` command, which corresponds to the `directory_path` in the `disk_to_mbtiles` function.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def disk_to_mbtiles(directory_path, mbtiles_file, **kwargs):
        # ...
        for zoom_dir in get_dirs(directory_path): # Line 145 in mbutil/util.py
            # ...
            for row_dir in get_dirs(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir)): # Line 157
                # ...
                for current_file in os.listdir(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir, row_dir)): # Line 165
                    # ...
                    f = open(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir, row_dir, current_file), 'rb') # Line 172
                    file_content = f.read()
                    f.close()
                    # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in how `directory_path` is used in `os.path.join` without any validation.
    - In line 145, `get_dirs(directory_path)` lists directories within the provided path. If `directory_path` is malicious (e.g., "../../evil_dir"), `get_dirs` will operate on that directory.
    - Similarly, in line 157 and 165, `os.path.join` concatenates the potentially malicious `directory_path` with subdirectory names, and `os.listdir` operates within the resulting path.
    - Finally, in line 172, `open` is called with the constructed path, which can lead to opening files outside the intended directory if `directory_path` is crafted maliciously.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a test environment with `mb-util` installed and accessible via command line.
    2. Create a sensitive file in a directory accessible to the user running `mb-util`, but outside the intended tile directory structure, for example, `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` with content "This is sensitive information.".
    3. Execute the `mb-util` command to import tiles, providing a malicious input path designed to traverse to the sensitive file. For instance:
       ```bash
       mb-util "../../tmp" output.mbtiles
       ```
    4. After execution, check the output directory (`output.mbtiles`). Observe if the tool attempts to access files under `/tmp` by monitoring file system access during the execution of `mb-util` using system tools like `strace` or `dtrace`.
    5. If system monitoring tools show that `mb-util` attempts to open and read `/tmp/sensitive_data.txt` (or any file under `/tmp` based on directory listing), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.


### 2. Path Traversal in `disk_to_mbtiles` (MBTiles Import) - Malicious Filenames in Input Directory

* Description:
    1. The `disk_to_mbtiles` function in `mbutil/util.py` is vulnerable to path traversal due to unsanitized filenames within the input directory.
    2. When importing tiles, the function iterates through files in the provided directory and its subdirectories.
    3. It uses `os.path.join` to construct file paths for reading tile data, incorporating filenames directly from the file system.
    4. If an attacker places a malicious file with a name containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../evil.png`) within the input directory, the `os.path.join` will construct a path that traverses outside the intended directory.
    5. When the code attempts to open and read these files, it can access or create files in unintended locations, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

* Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can potentially overwrite existing files or create new files in arbitrary locations on the file system where the user running `mb-util` has write access. This could lead to data corruption or potentially escalate to further attacks.

* Vulnerability Rank:
    - **High**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses filenames from the input directory without any validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Filename Sanitization: Validate that filenames obtained from the input directory do not contain path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths.
    - Path Normalization: Normalize all constructed file paths to ensure operations are confined to the intended directory.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Run `mb-util` with minimal necessary privileges.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a directory structure with malicious filenames that will be used as input to the `mb-util disk_to_mbtiles` command.
    - The user running `mb-util` must have sufficient permissions to write to the locations outside the intended directory that are targeted by the path traversal attempt.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def disk_to_mbtiles(directory_path, mbtiles_file, **kwargs):
        # ...
        def get_dirs(path):
            return [name for name in os.listdir(path)
                if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(path, name))]
        # ...
        for zoom_dir in get_dirs(directory_path):
            for row_dir in get_dirs(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir)):
                for current_file in os.listdir(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir, row_dir)):
                    f = open(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir, row_dir, current_file), 'rb') # Vulnerable line
                    # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability is in the line `f = open(os.path.join(directory_path, zoom_dir, row_dir, current_file), 'rb')`.
    - The `current_file` variable, which comes directly from `os.listdir`, is used without sanitization in `os.path.join`.
    - If `current_file` contains path traversal sequences, `os.path.join` will construct a path that goes outside the intended `directory_path`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a test directory named `test_path_traversal_input`.
    2. Inside it, create a directory `0`, and inside `0`, create another directory `0`.
    3. Inside `test_path_traversal_input/0/0`, create a file named `../../../evil.png` with content "evil data".
    4. Run `mb-util test_path_traversal_input test_path_traversal_output.mbtiles`.
    5. Verify if a file named `evil.png` has been created three directories up from where you ran the command and contains "evil data".


### 3. Path Traversal in `mbtiles_to_disk` (MBTiles Export) - Output Directory Path Traversal

* Description:
    1. The `mbtiles_to_disk` function exports tiles from an MBTiles file to a directory specified by the `directory_path` argument.
    2. The function creates directories and files within the `directory_path` to store the exported tiles.
    3. It constructs the output file paths using `os.path.join` with the `directory_path`, zoom level, tile column, and tile row.
    4. If a malicious `directory_path` like "../../evil_dir" is provided, the `os.path.join` will resolve to a path outside the intended base directory.
    5. When the code attempts to create directories and write tile data to files using the constructed path, it can write files to locations outside the intended directory, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
    6. An attacker could exploit this to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or introducing malicious content.

* Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can write arbitrary files to the file system accessible to the user running the `mb-util` tool. This could lead to overwriting important files, creating malicious files in unexpected locations, and potentially achieving code execution if write access to executable paths is gained.

* Vulnerability Rank:
    - **High**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: Similar to `disk_to_mbtiles`, there is no input validation or sanitization for `directory_path` in `mbtiles_to_disk`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The `directory_path` should be validated to prevent path traversal sequences and ensure it points to an allowed directory.
    - Path canonicalization: Canonicalize the output path to avoid surprises from symbolic links or redundant path components.
    - Restricting access: Run `mb-util` with minimal privileges to limit the damage from unauthorized file writes.
    - Output directory restrictions: Consider enforcing that the output directory must be within a predefined allowed path or under a specific user-controlled directory to restrict the scope of file writes.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `mb-util` command with the `mbtiles_to_disk` functionality (export operation).
    - The attacker must be able to control the `output` argument of the `mb-util` command, which corresponds to the `directory_path` in the `mbtiles_to_disk` function.
    - The user running `mb-util` must have write permissions in the targeted directory for the path traversal to be exploitable for writing files.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def mbtiles_to_disk(mbtiles_file, directory_path, **kwargs):
        # ...
        os.mkdir("%s" % directory_path) # Line 254 in mbutil/util.py
        # ...
        base_path = directory_path # Line 257
        # ...
        tile_dir = os.path.join(base_path, str(z), str(x)) # Line 268, 272, 278
        # ...
        tile = os.path.join(tile_dir,'%s.%s' % (y, kwargs.get('format', 'png'))) # Line 281, 284
        f = open(tile, 'wb') # Line 285
        # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability arises from using the unvalidated `directory_path` directly in file and directory creation functions.
    - `directory_path` is directly assigned to `base_path` and used in `os.path.join` to construct paths for tile directories and files.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a test environment with `mb-util` installed.
    2. Choose a sensitive location, e.g., `/tmp/evil_output_dir`.
    3. Create a dummy MBTiles file `test.mbtiles`.
    4. Execute: `mb-util test.mbtiles "../../tmp/evil_output_dir"`
    5. Check if the directory `/tmp/evil_output_dir` and files within it have been created. Verify that files and directories are created under `/tmp/evil_output_dir`.


### 4. Path Traversal in `mbtiles_to_disk` (MBTiles Export) - Malicious Tile Paths in MBTiles File

* Description:
    1. A malicious MBTiles file is crafted with tile paths containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../", "..\\") in the `tile_column` or `tile_row` fields of the `tiles` table.
    2. The attacker provides this malicious MBTiles file as input to `mb-util` in export mode (`mbtiles_to_disk`).
    3. During export, `mbtiles_to_disk` reads tile coordinates (`zoom_level`, `tile_column`, `tile_row`) directly from the MBTiles database and uses them to construct output file paths by joining them with the user-provided output directory path using `os.path.join`.
    4. Due to the lack of sanitization of these tile coordinates, the path traversal sequences embedded in the MBTiles file are not removed.
    5. When `mb-util` attempts to create directories and write tile data based on these malicious paths, it writes files to locations outside the intended output directory, potentially leading to file overwrite or creation in arbitrary locations.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Attackers can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially leading to file overwrite, data manipulation, or in severe cases, potential for code execution if executable files or configuration files can be targeted.

* Vulnerability Rank:
    - **High**

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code does not validate or sanitize tile paths read from the MBTiles file.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Sanitize the `tile_column` and `tile_row` values read from the MBTiles file to remove directory traversal sequences.
    - Path Validation: Validate that the constructed output paths are within the intended output directory.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Run `mb-util` with minimal necessary privileges to limit potential damage.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an MBTiles file to include malicious tile paths.
    - The user must use `mb-util` in export mode (`mbtiles_to_disk`) and process the malicious MBTiles file.
    - The user running `mb-util` must have write permissions to the locations targeted by the path traversal sequences.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def mbtiles_to_disk(mbtiles_file, directory_path, **kwargs):
        # ...
        base_path = directory_path
        # ...
        tiles = con.execute('select zoom_level, tile_column, tile_row, tile_data from tiles;')
        t = tiles.fetchone()
        while t:
            z = t[0] # zoom_level from database
            x = t[1] # tile_column from database - POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS
            y = t[2] # tile_row from database - POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS
            # ...
            tile_dir = os.path.join(base_path, str(z), str(x)) # vulnerable path construction
            # ...
            tile = os.path.join(tile_dir,'%s.%s' % (y, kwargs.get('format', 'png'))) # vulnerable path construction
            f = open(tile, 'wb') # file creation based on potentially malicious path
            # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in using `x = t[1]` (`tile_column`) and `y = t[2]` (`tile_row`) from the database directly in `os.path.join` without sanitization.
    - If the MBTiles file contains malicious values in `tile_column` or `tile_row` (like "../evil_dir"), path traversal will occur during file creation.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious MBTiles file `malicious.mbtiles` using sqlite:
       ```bash
       sqlite3 malicious.mbtiles "CREATE TABLE tiles (zoom_level INTEGER, tile_column INTEGER, tile_row INTEGER, tile_data BLOB);"
       sqlite3 malicious.mbtiles "INSERT INTO tiles (zoom_level, tile_column, tile_row, tile_data) VALUES (0, '../evil_dir', 'file', 'test data');"
       ```
    2. Execute: `mb-util malicious.mbtiles output_test_dir`
    3. Check if a directory `evil_dir` has been created in the parent directory of `output_test_dir`, and if a file `file.png` exists within `evil_dir`.
    4. Successful creation of `evil_dir` and `file.png` outside `output_test_dir` confirms the vulnerability.
