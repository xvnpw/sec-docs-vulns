### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Numerical instability in inverse sigmoidal function

- Description:
    1. The `sigmoidal` function in `rio_color/operations.py` is used to adjust image contrast. When the `contrast` parameter (beta) is set to a negative value, the function enters an "inverse sigmoidal" mode.
    2. In this inverse mode, the calculation involves a complex formula that includes a logarithm and division operations.
    3. If an input array (`arr`) contains pixel values very close to 0 or 1, and a large negative `contrast` value is used, the intermediate calculations within the inverse sigmoidal function can lead to numerical instability. Specifically, it can result in division by zero or taking the logarithm of zero or a negative number.
    4. Although the code uses `np.seterr(divide="ignore", invalid="ignore")` to suppress warnings and errors from these operations, the resulting output array might contain `NaN` (Not a Number) or `Inf` (Infinity) values.
    5. A malicious attacker could craft a GeoTIFF file with pixel values designed to be close to 0 or 1 and trick a user into processing this file with `rio color` or the `rio_color` library, applying a `sigmoidal` operation with a large negative contrast value. This could trigger the numerical instability.

- Impact:
    - The numerical instability can lead to incorrect image processing results.
    - The output GeoTIFF file might contain `NaN` or `Inf` values, corrupting the image data and potentially causing issues in downstream applications that rely on the processed GeoTIFF.
    - While this vulnerability is unlikely to directly cause code execution or memory corruption, it compromises the integrity and reliability of the image processing performed by `rio-color`.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The code includes `np.seterr(divide="ignore", invalid="ignore")` within the `sigmoidal` function. This attempts to suppress warnings and errors that arise from division by zero and invalid floating-point operations during the inverse sigmoidal calculation.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The application lacks input validation to check the range of the `contrast` parameter for the `sigmoidal` operation. It should implement checks to limit the range of allowed `contrast` values, especially negative values, to prevent users from providing extreme inputs that could trigger numerical instability.
    - **Numerical Stability Improvements**: The inverse sigmoidal function calculation should be reviewed and potentially rewritten to use more numerically stable algorithms that are less susceptible to producing `NaN` or `Inf` values, even with extreme input values.
    - **Explicit Error Handling**: Instead of just ignoring errors, the code should explicitly check for conditions that might lead to numerical instability (e.g., input values close to 0 or 1 when using negative contrast) and handle these cases gracefully, for example, by clipping input values or returning a controlled error message instead of proceeding with unstable calculations.

- Preconditions:
    1. A user must process a GeoTIFF image using either the `rio color` command-line tool or the `rio_color` Python library.
    2. The user must apply a `sigmoidal` operation with a large negative `contrast` value as a parameter. For example, using the command `rio color input.tif output.tif sigmoidal rgb -100 0.5`.
    3. The input GeoTIFF image must contain pixel values in the bands being processed by the `sigmoidal` operation that are close to 0 or 1 (when pixel values are normalized to the 0-1 range).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/rio_color/operations.py`
    - Function: `sigmoidal(arr, contrast, bias)`
    - Vulnerable code block:
      ```python
      else:
          # Inverse sigmoidal function:
          output = (
              (beta * alpha)
              - np.log(
                  (
                      1
                      / (
                          (arr / (1 + np.exp(beta * alpha - beta)))
                          - (arr / (1 + np.exp(beta * alpha)))
                          + (1 / (1 + np.exp(beta * alpha)))
                      )
                  )
                  - 1
              )
          ) / beta
      ```
    - In this code block, when `beta` (contrast) is negative and `arr` is close to 0, the expression inside `np.log` can become very small or negative, leading to `np.log` returning `-Inf` or `NaN`. Similarly, division by `beta` (which is negative and potentially large in magnitude) and other operations can propagate these numerical issues.
    - The `np.seterr(divide="ignore", invalid="ignore")` at the beginning of the function only suppresses error reporting, but does not prevent the numerical instability.

- Security test case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious GeoTIFF:** Create a small GeoTIFF file (e.g., `malicious.tif`) with 1x1 pixel and 3 bands (RGB). Set the pixel values to be very close to zero, for example, by creating a GeoTIFF with `uint16` datatype and pixel values [1, 1, 1]. When normalized to 0-1 range, these values will be very close to 0.
    2. **Run `rio color` with malicious GeoTIFF and negative contrast:** Execute the following command in a terminal, replacing `/path/to/rio-color/rio_color/scripts/cli.py` with the actual path to the `rio color` script if necessary, and assuming `malicious.tif` is in the current directory:
    ```bash
    rio color malicious.tif output.tif sigmoidal rgb -100 0.5
    ```
    3. **Inspect the output GeoTIFF:** Open the output GeoTIFF file (`output.tif`) using a tool like `rasterio` in Python or QGIS. Check the pixel values of the output image.
    4. **Verify NaN/Inf values:** Using `rasterio` or `numpy`, read the pixel data of the output GeoTIFF and check if there are `NaN` or `Inf` values present in the pixel array. For example, in Python:
    ```python
    import rasterio
    import numpy as np

    with rasterio.open('output.tif') as src:
        output_array = src.read()
        has_nan = np.isnan(output_array).any()
        has_inf = np.isinf(output_array).any()
        print(f"Contains NaN: {has_nan}")
        print(f"Contains Inf: {has_inf}")
    ```
    5. **Expected Result:** The test should demonstrate that when processing the malicious GeoTIFF with a large negative contrast in the `sigmoidal` operation, the output GeoTIFF contains `NaN` or `Inf` values, indicating numerical instability in the inverse sigmoidal function.
