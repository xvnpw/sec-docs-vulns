### Vulnerability List:

* Path Traversal

#### Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal

* Description:
A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `rio-rgbify` application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious `SRC_PATH` argument. The application directly uses the user-supplied `SRC_PATH` in `rasterio.open()` without proper validation or sanitization. By providing a path like `../../../sensitive_file.txt`, an attacker can bypass intended directory restrictions and access files outside of the application's expected input directory.

* Impact:
An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system, potentially including configuration files, application code, or user data. This can lead to information disclosure, which could be further exploited to gain unauthorized access or compromise the system's security.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. The application uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `SRC_PATH`, which only checks if the provided path exists but does not prevent path traversal outside of intended directories.

* Missing Mitigations:
Input validation and sanitization for `SRC_PATH` are missing. The application should:
    - Validate that the `SRC_PATH` is within an allowed directory or set of directories.
    - Sanitize the `SRC_PATH` to remove path traversal sequences like `../` before using it in file operations.
    - Consider using secure file handling practices, such as using file descriptors or operating within a chroot environment if feasible.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `rio-rgbify` command-line application.
    - The application must be running with sufficient permissions to access the targeted files if path traversal is successful.

* Source Code Analysis:
1. **`rio_rgbify/scripts/cli.py` - `rgbify` function:**
    ```python
    @click.command("rgbify")
    @click.argument("src_path", type=click.Path(exists=True))
    @click.argument("dst_path", type=click.Path(exists=False))
    # ... other options ...
    def rgbify(
        ctx,
        src_path,
        dst_path,
        # ... other parameters ...
    ):
        """rio-rgbify cli."""
        if dst_path.split(".")[-1].lower() == "tif":
            with rio.open(src_path) as src: # Vulnerable line
                # ... rest of the code ...
        elif dst_path.split(".")[-1].lower() == "mbtiles":
            with RGBTiler(src_path, dst_path, ...) as tiler: # Vulnerable line inside RGBTiler init
                tiler.run(workers)
        else:
            # ... error ...
    ```
    The `rgbify` function in `rio_rgbify/scripts/cli.py` directly takes the `src_path` argument, which is defined using `click.Path(exists=True)`. This `click.Path` type only verifies if the path exists and converts it to an absolute path. It does **not** prevent path traversal.
    When the destination path is a `tif` file, `rio.open(src_path)` is called. When the destination path is `mbtiles`, `RGBTiler` is initialized with `src_path`, and inside `RGBTiler.__init__` and later in `RGBTiler.run`, `rasterio.open(self.inpath)` is called. In both scenarios, the user-controlled `src_path` is passed to `rasterio.open()` without any sanitization.

2. **`rasterio.open(src_path)`:**
    `rasterio.open()` (backed by GDAL) will attempt to open the file specified by `src_path`. If `src_path` contains path traversal sequences like `../`, it will resolve them and potentially access files outside the intended directory, as long as the application has the necessary file system permissions.

* Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    - Create a file named `sensitive.txt` in the parent directory of the `/code` directory (assuming `/code` is the project root). This file will represent a sensitive file an attacker might want to access. Put some content in `sensitive.txt`, e.g., "This is sensitive data.".
    - Create a dummy GeoTIFF file named `dummy.tif` inside the `/code/test/fixtures/` directory. This is needed because `rio-rgbify` expects a raster input. You can reuse the existing `elev.tif` or create a new minimal valid GeoTIFF.

2. **Execution:**
    - Run the `rio-rgbify` command using the `CliRunner` from `click.testing`.
    - Set `SRC_PATH` to traverse to the `sensitive.txt` file created in the parent directory: `../../../sensitive.txt`.
    - Set `DST_PATH` to a dummy output GeoTIFF file name: `output.tif`.
    - Execute the command:
    ```python
    import os
    from click.testing import CliRunner
    from rio_rgbify.scripts.cli import rgbify

    def test_path_traversal_vulnerability():
        runner = CliRunner()
        with runner.isolated_filesystem():
            # Create dummy input raster (using existing fixture)
            input_raster = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "fixtures", "elev.tif")
            output_raster = "output.tif"
            sensitive_file_path = "../../../sensitive.txt" # Path traversal to access sensitive.txt

            # Create sensitive.txt in the parent directory (simulating sensitive file)
            sensitive_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
            sensitive_file = os.path.join(sensitive_dir, "sensitive.txt")
            with open(sensitive_file, 'w') as f:
                f.write("This is sensitive data.")

            result = runner.invoke(
                rgbify,
                [sensitive_file_path, output_raster, "--interval", 1] # Minimal command to trigger vulnerability
            )

            # Assert that the command executes successfully (or at least doesn't explicitly fail due to path traversal prevention)
            # If rasterio.open tries to open sensitive.txt as a raster, it might fail with GDAL error, but it still indicates path traversal
            assert result.exit_code != 0 # Expecting an error as sensitive.txt is not a valid raster, but no explicit path traversal prevention error.
            assert "not a supported raster data source" in str(result.output) or "ERROR" in str(result.output) # Check for GDAL error indicating attempt to open non-raster file.

            # Cleanup sensitive.txt
            os.remove(sensitive_file)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        test_path_traversal_vulnerability()
    ```

3. **Verification:**
    - Run the test case.
    - Observe the exit code and output of the command. If the exit code is 0 or if the error message indicates a problem related to the *content* of `sensitive.txt` (e.g., "not a supported raster data source") rather than a path error, it confirms that `rasterio.open()` attempted to open `sensitive.txt` via path traversal. If the exit code is 0 and an output file is created, it would be a more severe finding, indicating potential processing of the sensitive file as raster data. In this specific case, we expect a non-zero exit code and an error message from GDAL because `sensitive.txt` is not a valid raster file, but the fact that GDAL *tries* to open it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that the application is vulnerable to path traversal, as it attempts to open and process `sensitive.txt` located outside the intended input directory, confirming the vulnerability.
