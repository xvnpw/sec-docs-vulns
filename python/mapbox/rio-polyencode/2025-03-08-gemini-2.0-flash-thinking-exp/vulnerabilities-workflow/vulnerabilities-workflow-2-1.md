### Vulnerability 1: File Path Injection in `rio polyencode` and `rio polydecode` commands

- **Vulnerability Name:** File Path Injection
- **Description:**
    The `rio polyencode` and `rio polydecode` commands are vulnerable to file path injection. By providing a maliciously crafted file path as input to the `INPUTS` or `OUTPUT` arguments, an attacker can read or write arbitrary files on the system.

    **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
    1. An attacker executes the `rio polyencode` or `rio polydecode` command.
    2. For `rio polyencode`, the attacker provides a path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `INPUTS` argument to read arbitrary files or in the `OUTPUT` argument to write arbitrary files.
    3. For `rio polydecode`, the attacker provides a path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `INPUT` argument to read arbitrary files or in the `OUTPUT` argument to write arbitrary files.
    4. The application uses `rasterio.open` to open the file at the provided path without proper validation.
    5. If the path points to a sensitive file (for read) or a critical location (for write), the attacker can achieve unauthorized file access or modification.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the system, such as configuration files, application code, or user data. For example, an attacker might be able to read `/etc/passwd` or other sensitive configuration files.
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the system. This could lead to overwriting critical system files, injecting malicious code into writable directories, or causing denial of service by filling up disk space. For example, an attacker might be able to write to `/tmp/malicious_file` or overwrite application configuration files.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The application uses `click.Path(resolve_path=True)`, which resolves the path to be absolute but does not prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. It does not sanitize or validate the input paths to restrict access within allowed directories.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Sanitization:** Implement path sanitization to remove path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`) from user-provided file paths.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate that the provided input and output paths are within an expected and safe directory. Restrict file operations to a specific allowed directory or a set of predefined paths.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful file path injection attack.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `rio polyencode` or `rio polydecode` commands. This could be through direct command-line access, or indirectly through a web application or service that utilizes these commands.

        ```python
        @click.argument(
            "inputfiles",
            type=click.Path(resolve_path=True), # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
            required=True,
            nargs=-1,
            metavar="INPUTS",
        )
        @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True)) # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
        def polyencode(ctx, inputfiles, output, poly_order, reflect):
            # ...
            with rio.open(inputfiles[0]) as src: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized input path
                metaprof = src.profile.copy()

            # ...

            with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized output path
                # ...
        ```
        ```python
        @click.argument(
            "inputfile",
            type=click.Path(resolve_path=True), # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
            required=True,
            metavar="INPUT",
        )
        @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True)) # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
        def polydecode(ctx, inputfile, output, x):
            # ...
            with rio.open(inputfile) as src: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized input path
                metaprof = src.profile.copy()
            # ...
            with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized output path
                # ...
        ```
    - **Explanation:**
        The `click.Path(resolve_path=True)` is used for both input and output file paths in `polyencode` and `polydecode` commands. While `resolve_path=True` resolves the path to be absolute, it does not prevent path traversal attacks. The `rio.open()` function then directly uses these user-provided paths to open files. If an attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` as input or `../../../../tmp/output.tif` as output, `rio.open()` will attempt to access these paths, leading to file path injection vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure `rio-polyencode` is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
        - Create a dummy input raster file named `input.tif` in the current directory (the content of the file is not important for this test case).
    2. **Test Case 1: Arbitrary File Read using `rio polyencode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polyencode ../../../../etc/passwd output.tif input.tif
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** The command attempts to read `/etc/passwd`. While `rasterio` might fail to open `/etc/passwd` as a valid raster file and throw an error, the attempt to access a file outside the intended directory demonstrates the file path injection vulnerability. Observe error messages or file access logs to confirm access attempt to `/etc/passwd`. If error messages reveal content of `/etc/passwd` it confirms vulnerability.

    3. **Test Case 2: Arbitrary File Write using `rio polyencode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polyencode input.tif ../../../../tmp/output.tif
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** The command attempts to write the output to `/tmp/output.tif`. Check if a file named `output.tif` is created in the `/tmp` directory after running the command. Successful creation of the file in `/tmp` confirms arbitrary file write vulnerability.

    4. **Test Case 3: Arbitrary File Read using `rio polydecode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polydecode ../../../../etc/passwd output.tif 10
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** Similar to Test Case 1, the command attempts to read `/etc/passwd`. Observe error messages or file access logs to confirm access attempt to `/etc/passwd`. If error messages reveal content of `/etc/passwd` it confirms vulnerability.

    5. **Test Case 4: Arbitrary File Write using `rio polydecode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polydecode input.tif ../../../../tmp/output.tif 10
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** Similar to Test Case 2, the command attempts to write to `/tmp/output.tif`. Check if a file named `output.tif` is created in the `/tmp` directory after running the command. Successful creation of the file in `/tmp` confirms arbitrary file write vulnerability.
