### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical vulnerabilities identified in the `rio-polyencode` tool. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.

#### 1. Command Injection via Filename Arguments

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Filename Arguments
- **Description:**
  An attacker can achieve command injection by crafting malicious filenames or paths provided as `INPUTS` or `OUTPUT` arguments to the `polyencode` or `polydecode` commands. These arguments, intended to specify raster file paths, are passed to the `rasterio.open()` function without proper sanitization. If the underlying GDAL library, used by `rasterio`, is susceptible to command injection through filenames, this vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution on the system.

  **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
  1. The attacker crafts a malicious filename or path. This malicious input is designed to be interpreted as a command when processed by the system, especially by GDAL through `rasterio.open()`.
  2. The attacker uses the `rio polyencode` or `rio polydecode` command-line tool, providing the malicious filename as either an `INPUTS` argument for `polyencode`, or `INPUT` argument for `polydecode`, or as the `OUTPUT` argument for either command.
  3. When the Python script executes `rio.open()` with the attacker-controlled filename, and if GDAL is vulnerable to command injection through filenames in the given environment, GDAL attempts to process the filename.
  4. Due to insufficient sanitization, GDAL interprets the malicious filename as a command and executes it on the server.

- **Impact:**
  Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where the `rio-polyencode` tool is running. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the server.
    - **Data Theft:** Sensitive data stored on the server can be accessed and exfiltrated.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete critical data.
    - **Denial of Service:** The system can be made unavailable through malicious commands.
    - **Lateral Movement:** The compromised system can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  None. The project uses `click.Path(resolve_path=True)` for path arguments, which only resolves the path to be absolute. This does not provide any security against command injection vulnerabilities. There is no input sanitization or validation implemented in the code to prevent malicious filenames from being processed by `rasterio.open()`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of all filename and path arguments (`INPUTS`, `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`) before they are passed to `rasterio.open()`. This could include:
    - **Whitelisting allowed characters:** Restrict filenames to a safe set of characters (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens, periods).
    - **Path validation:** Ensure that the provided paths conform to expected patterns and do not contain unexpected elements that could be interpreted as commands.
  - **Secure Path Handling:** Explore and utilize secure path handling functions provided by `rasterio` or GDAL, if available, that can prevent command injection.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the `rio-polyencode` tool with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. **Attacker Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `rio-polyencode` command-line tool and control the `INPUTS`, `INPUT`, or `OUTPUT` arguments.
  2. **GDAL Vulnerability (Context Dependent):** The underlying GDAL library must be vulnerable to command injection through filenames in the specific environment and configuration where `rio-polyencode` is running.

- **Source Code Analysis:**

  1. **`rio_polyencode/scripts/cli.py`:**
     - **`polyencode` function:**
       ```python
       @click.command(short_help="")
       @click.argument(
           "inputfiles",
           type=click.Path(resolve_path=True),
           required=True,
           nargs=-1,
           metavar="INPUTS",
       )
       @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True))
       ...
       def polyencode(ctx, inputfiles, output, poly_order, reflect):
           ...
           with rio.open(inputfiles[0]) as src: # Vulnerable line 1
               ...
           for i, p in enumerate(inputfiles):
               with rio.open(p) as src:        # Vulnerable line 2
                   ...
           with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable line 3
               ...
       ```

     - **`polydecode` function:**
       ```python
       @click.command(short_help="")
       @click.argument(
           "inputfile",
           type=click.Path(resolve_path=True),
           required=True,
           metavar="INPUT",
       )
       @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True))
       @click.argument("x", type=float)
       ...
       def polydecode(ctx, inputfile, output, x):
           ...
           with rio.open(inputfile) as src: # Vulnerable line 1
               ...
           with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable line 2
               ...
       ```
     - **Explanation:**
       The `click.Path(resolve_path=True)` is used for both input and output file paths in `polyencode` and `polydecode` commands. User-provided filenames from `inputfiles`, `inputfile`, and `output` arguments are directly passed to `rio.open()` without any sanitization, leading to potential command injection vulnerabilities if GDAL or underlying system calls are susceptible to command injection through filenames.

- **Security Test Case:**

  1. **Setup:**
     - Ensure `rio-polyencode` is installed in a test environment.
     - Create a dummy GeoTIFF input file named `input.tif`.

  2. **Test for `polyencode` command injection:**
     ```bash
       rio polyencode "input.tif; touch /tmp/pwned_encode" output_encode.tif
     ```
     - **Verification:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_encode` has been created.

  3. **Test for `polydecode` command injection:**
     ```bash
       rio polydecode "input.tif; touch /tmp/pwned_decode" output_decode.tif 10
     ```
     - **Verification:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_decode` has been created.

  **Expected Result:**
  If either `/tmp/pwned_encode` or `/tmp/pwned_decode` files are created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

#### 2. File Path Injection in `rio polyencode` and `rio polydecode` commands

- **Vulnerability Name:** File Path Injection
- **Description:**
    The `rio polyencode` and `rio polydecode` commands are vulnerable to file path injection. By providing a maliciously crafted file path as input to the `INPUTS` or `OUTPUT` arguments, an attacker can read or write arbitrary files on the system.

    **Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
    1. An attacker executes the `rio polyencode` or `rio polydecode` command.
    2. For `rio polyencode`, the attacker provides a path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `INPUTS` argument to read arbitrary files or in the `OUTPUT` argument to write arbitrary files.
    3. For `rio polydecode`, the attacker provides a path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `INPUT` argument to read arbitrary files or in the `OUTPUT` argument to write arbitrary files.
    4. The application uses `rasterio.open` to open the file at the provided path without proper validation.
    5. If the path points to a sensitive file (for read) or a critical location (for write), the attacker can achieve unauthorized file access or modification.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the system, such as configuration files, application code, or user data.
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the system. This could lead to overwriting critical system files or injecting malicious code.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The application uses `click.Path(resolve_path=True)`, which resolves the path to be absolute but does not prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Sanitization:** Implement path sanitization to remove path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`) from user-provided file paths.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate that the provided input and output paths are within an expected and safe directory.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to execute the `rio polyencode` or `rio polydecode` commands.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/rio_polyencode/scripts/cli.py`
    - **Function:** `polyencode` and `polydecode`
    - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        @click.argument(
            "inputfiles",
            type=click.Path(resolve_path=True), # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
            required=True,
            nargs=-1,
            metavar="INPUTS",
        )
        @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True)) # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
        def polyencode(ctx, inputfiles, output, poly_order, reflect):
            # ...
            with rio.open(inputfiles[0]) as src: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized input path
                metaprof = src.profile.copy()
            # ...
            with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized output path
                # ...
        ```
        ```python
        @click.argument(
            "inputfile",
            type=click.Path(resolve_path=True), # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
            required=True,
            metavar="INPUT",
        )
        @click.argument("output", type=click.Path(resolve_path=True)) # Vulnerable: resolve_path=True does not prevent path traversal
        def polydecode(ctx, inputfile, output, x):
            # ...
            with rio.open(inputfile) as src: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized input path
                metaprof = src.profile.copy()
            # ...
            with rio.open(output, "w", **metaprof) as dst: # Vulnerable: rio.open uses unsanitized output path
                # ...
        ```
    - **Explanation:**
        The `click.Path(resolve_path=True)` does not prevent path traversal attacks. The `rio.open()` function directly uses user-provided paths, leading to file path injection vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Test Case 1: Arbitrary File Read using `rio polyencode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polyencode ../../../../etc/passwd output.tif input.tif
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** Attempt to read `/etc/passwd`.

    2. **Test Case 2: Arbitrary File Write using `rio polyencode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polyencode input.tif ../../../../tmp/output.tif
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** File `output.tif` is created in `/tmp`.

    3. **Test Case 3: Arbitrary File Read using `rio polydecode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polydecode ../../../../etc/passwd output.tif 10
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** Attempt to read `/etc/passwd`.

    4. **Test Case 4: Arbitrary File Write using `rio polydecode`:**
        ```bash
        rio polydecode input.tif ../../../../tmp/output.tif 10
        ```
        - **Expected Result:** File `output.tif` is created in `/tmp`.
