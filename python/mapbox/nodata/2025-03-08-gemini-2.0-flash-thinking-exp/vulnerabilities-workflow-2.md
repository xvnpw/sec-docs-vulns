### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `--co` option
- Description:
    1.  The user executes the `nodata blob` command.
    2.  The user provides a malicious payload within the `--co` option. For example, a user could try to inject a command like `COMPRESS=LZW;$(touch /tmp/pwned)` or `BIGTIFF=YES;$(calc)`.
    3.  The `nodata blob` script passes these options directly to `rasterio.open` without sanitization.
    4.  Rasterio, through its GDAL backend, interprets the malicious payload as part of the creation options. If GDAL drivers are not designed to handle such inputs securely, they might execute the injected commands.
- Impact:
    - Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the user running the `nodata` tool. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored on the system.
        - **System Compromise:**  Full control over the system, allowing for installation of malware, creation of new accounts, or further attacks on internal networks.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly passes the user-supplied `--co` options to `rasterio.open` without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for the `--co` option are missing. The application should:
        - **Whitelist valid creation options:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed creation options and only accept those.
        - **Sanitize option values:** If whitelisting is not feasible, sanitize the values provided for creation options to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or command sequences.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `nodata blob` command.
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the `nodata blob` command, specifically the `--co` option.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`nodata/scripts/cli.py`**:
        ```python
        @click.command(
            short_help="Blob + expand valid data area by (inter|extra)polation into"
                       "nodata areas")
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        @click.option('--bidx', '-b', default=None,
            help="Bands to blob [default = all]")
        @click.option('--max-search-distance', '-m', default=4,
            help="Maximum blobbing radius [default = 4]")
        @click.option('--nibblemask', '-n', default=False, is_flag=True,
            help="Nibble blobbed nodata areas [default=False]")
        @creation_options
        @click.option('--mask-threshold', '-d', default=None, type=int,
            help="Alpha pixel threshold upon which to regard data as masked "
                 "(ie, for lossy you'd want an aggressive threshold of 0) "
                 "[default=None]")
        @click.option('--jobs', '-j', default=4, type=int,
            help="Number of workers for multiprocessing [default=4]")
        @click.option('--alphafy', '-a', is_flag=True,
            help='If a RGB raster is found, blob + add alpha band where nodata is')
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy):
            """"""
            args = (src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                    creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
            blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
        ```
        -   The `blob` function in `cli.py` uses the `@creation_options` decorator from `rasterio.rio.options`. This decorator automatically adds options to the command-line interface that correspond to GDAL driver creation options.
        -   The `creation_options` are directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function.

    2.  **`nodata/blob.py`**:
        ```python
        def blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, maskThreshold, workers, alphafy):
            """
            """
            with rio.open(src_path) as src:
                windows = [
                    [window, ij] for ij, window in src.block_windows()
                ]

                options = src.meta.copy()
                kwds = src.profile.copy()

                outNodata, selectNodata, outCount = test_rgb(src.count, src.nodata, alphafy, 4)

                options.update(**kwds)
                options.update(**creation_options) # Vulnerable line
                options.update(count=outCount, nodata=outNodata)

                # ... rest of the code ...

            with riomucho.RioMucho(
                    [src_path], dst_path, blob_worker,
                    windows=windows,
                    global_args={
                        'max_search_distance': max_search_distance,
                        'nibblemask': nibblemask,
                        'bands': bidx,
                        'maskThreshold': maskThreshold,
                        'selectNodata': selectNodata
                    },
                    options=options, # options dictionary passed to riomucho and rasterio.open
                    mode='manual_read') as rm:

                rm.run(workers)
        ```
        -   In `blob_nodata`, the `creation_options` dictionary, which contains user-provided values from the `--co` option, is directly used to update the `options` dictionary.
        -   This `options` dictionary is then passed to `riomucho.RioMucho` and eventually to `rasterio.open` when creating the destination raster file.
        -   `rasterio.open` uses GDAL, and GDAL's driver-specific creation options are known to be vulnerable to command injection if not handled carefully. By directly passing user-controlled options to `rasterio.open`, the application becomes vulnerable to command injection.
- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Pre-requisites:**
        -   Have the `nodata` tool installed and accessible in your environment.
        -   Have a sample raster image file (e.g., `input.tif`) that `nodata blob` can process.

    2.  **Steps:**
        ```bash
        # Execute nodata blob with a malicious --co option to trigger command injection.
        # This example attempts to create a file named 'pwned' in the /tmp directory.
        nodata blob input.tif output.tif --co "COMPRESS=LZW;$(touch /tmp/pwned)"

        # Verify if the command injection was successful.
        # Check if the file /tmp/pwned was created.
        ls /tmp/pwned
        ```
    3.  **Expected Result:**
        -   If the command injection is successful, the `ls /tmp/pwned` command should show that the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created in the `/tmp` directory.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Source File Path
- Description:
    1.  The `nodata blob` command in `nodata/scripts/cli.py` takes `src_path` as an argument, which specifies the input raster file.
    2.  The `src_path` is passed to the `blob_nodata` function in `nodata/blob.py`.
    3.  The `blob_nodata` function directly uses `src_path` in `rasterio.open(src_path)` to open the input raster file.
    4.  The application does not sanitize or validate the `src_path`.
    5.  A malicious user can provide a crafted `src_path` containing path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside the intended directory.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized File Read: An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server if the application process has the necessary permissions. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `src_path`, which only checks if the file exists but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path sanitization: The application should sanitize the `src_path` to prevent path traversal attacks by validating that the path is within an expected directory or subdirectory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to execute the `nodata blob` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`/code/nodata/scripts/cli.py`**:
        ```python
        @click.command
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        ...
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, ...):
            blob_nodata(src_path, dst_path, ...)
        ```
        -   `click.argument` defines `src_path` as a command-line argument. `click.Path(exists=True)` only ensures the file exists, but doesn't prevent path traversal.
        -   `src_path` is directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function.
    2.  **`/code/nodata/blob.py`**:
        ```python
        def blob_nodata(src_path, dst_path, ...):
            with rio.open(src_path) as src: # Vulnerable line
                ...
        ```
        -   `rasterio.open(src_path)` opens the raster file using the user-provided `src_path` without sanitization, leading to path traversal.
- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Pre-requisites:**
        - Access to the `nodata` command-line tool.
        - A publicly readable file on the system, e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux systems.
    2.  **Steps:**
        ```bash
        nodata blob /etc/passwd /path/to/output.tif
        ```
    3.  **Expected Result:**
        - The command should attempt to open `/etc/passwd` using `rasterio.open()`, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Destination File Path
- Description:
    1.  The `nodata blob` command in `nodata/scripts/cli.py` takes `dst_path` as an argument, which specifies the output raster file path.
    2.  The `dst_path` is passed to the `blob_nodata` function in `nodata/blob.py`.
    3.  The `blob_nodata` function directly uses `dst_path` in `riomucho.RioMucho` as the destination path for writing the processed raster file.
    4.  The application does not sanitize or validate the `dst_path`.
    5.  A malicious user can provide a crafted `dst_path` containing path traversal sequences like `../` to write files outside the intended directory.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized File Write/Overwrite: An attacker could write arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to data modification or system instability.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application uses `click.Path(exists=False)` for `dst_path`, which only checks if the file does not exist but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output path sanitization: The application should sanitize the `dst_path` to prevent path traversal attacks by validating that the path is within an expected directory or subdirectory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to execute the `nodata blob` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`/code/nodata/scripts/cli.py`**:
        ```python
        @click.command
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        ...
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, ...):
            blob_nodata(src_path, dst_path, ...)
        ```
        -   `click.argument` defines `dst_path` as a command-line argument. `click.Path(exists=False)` only ensures the file does not exist, but doesn't prevent path traversal.
        -   `dst_path` is directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function.
    2.  **`/code/nodata/blob.py`**:
        ```python
        def blob_nodata(src_path, dst_path, ...):
            ...
            with riomucho.RioMucho(
                    [src_path], dst_path, blob_worker, # Vulnerable line
                    ...) as rm:
                rm.run(workers)
        ```
        -   `riomucho.RioMucho([src_path], dst_path, ...)` uses `dst_path` as the output file path without sanitization, leading to path traversal and arbitrary file write.
- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Pre-requisites:**
        - Access to the `nodata` command-line tool.
        - Write permissions in the `/tmp` directory.
    2.  **Steps:**
        ```bash
        nodata blob /path/to/source.tif /tmp/evil_file.tif
        ```
    3.  **Expected Result:**
        - The command should create a raster file at `/tmp/evil_file.tif`, confirming the path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability.
