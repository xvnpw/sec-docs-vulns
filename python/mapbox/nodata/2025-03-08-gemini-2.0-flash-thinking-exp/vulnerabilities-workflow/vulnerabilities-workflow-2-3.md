### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `src_path` argument
- Description:
    1. An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted `src_path` argument to the `nodata blob` command.
    2. The application uses `click.Path` to handle the `src_path` argument, but it does not enforce restrictions to prevent path traversal.
    3. The `src_path` argument is passed to `rasterio.open()` function in `nodata/blob.py` without further validation or sanitization.
    4. `rasterio.open()` will open the file specified by the user-provided path, even if it is outside the intended working directory.
    5. By providing a path like `/etc/passwd` or `../../sensitive_file`, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the application process has permissions to access.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure. This could include configuration files, application code, or user data, depending on the server's file system structure and permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The application uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `src_path`. This ensures that the provided source path exists, but it does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `src_path` is missing to prevent path traversal.
    - Using `click.Path` with `path_type=click.PathType(resolve_path=True, dir_okay=False, file_okay=True, path_type=str)` and enforcing a strict base path for allowed source files would mitigate this vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `nodata blob` command and control the `src_path` argument. This is typically the case for command-line applications where users can provide arguments.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`nodata/scripts/cli.py`**:
        ```python
        @click.command(
            short_help="Blob + expand valid data area by (inter|extra)polation into"
                       "nodata areas")
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        ...
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy):
            """"""
            args = (src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                    creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
            blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
        ```
        - The `blob` command in `cli.py` defines `src_path` as a `click.Path(exists=True)` argument.
        - `click.Path(exists=True)` only checks if the path exists but does not prevent path traversal.
        - The `src_path` is directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function.

    2. **`nodata/blob.py`**:
        ```python
        def blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, maskThreshold, workers, alphafy):
            """
            """
            with rio.open(src_path) as src:
                ...
        ```
        - The `blob_nodata` function receives `src_path` and directly uses it in `rio.open(src_path)`.
        - `rio.open()` from `rasterio` will open the file at the provided path without any path traversal protection.
        - Therefore, a malicious `src_path` will be processed by `rasterio.open()`, leading to path traversal.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Access to the `nodata` command-line tool.
        - A publicly readable file on the system, for example `/etc/passwd` on Linux systems.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you can execute the `nodata` command.
        - Execute the following command, replacing `/path/to/output.tif` with a writable path in your testing environment:
          ```bash
          nodata blob /etc/passwd /path/to/output.tif
          ```
        - Check if the command executes without errors. If `rasterio` can open `/etc/passwd` as a raster file (which it likely won't, but it will attempt to open and might throw a different error related to file format if it tries to interpret it as a raster), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. Even if it throws an error related to file format, attempting to open `/etc/passwd` is still a path traversal.
        - To further confirm, try to read a valid raster file using a path traversal sequence. Assume there is a raster file at `/tmp/test.tif`. Execute:
          ```bash
          nodata blob ../../../tmp/test.tif /path/to/output.tif
          ```
          (assuming the current working directory is a few levels deep from the root). If this command works and processes `/tmp/test.tif`, it confirms path traversal.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The command should attempt to open `/etc/passwd` or `/tmp/test.tif` (depending on the test case) using `rasterio.open()`. Ideally, the application should prevent accessing files outside of the intended directory, but in this case, it will attempt to open the provided path, confirming the vulnerability. Error messages related to file format from `rasterio` when trying to open `/etc/passwd` still indicate the vulnerability as the application attempted to access and process the file based on the user-provided path.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `dst_path` argument
- Description:
    1. An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted `dst_path` argument to the `nodata blob` command.
    2. The application uses `click.Path` to handle the `dst_path` argument, but it does not enforce restrictions to prevent path traversal.
    3. The `dst_path` argument is passed to `rasterio.open()` function in `nodata/blob.py` with write mode ('w') without further validation or sanitization.
    4. `rasterio.open()` will create and write to the file specified by the user-provided path, even if it is outside the intended working directory.
    5. By providing a path like `/tmp/evil_file` or `../../evil_file`, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system that the application process has permissions to write to. This could potentially lead to overwriting important files or creating files in unexpected locations.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to data modification, system instability, or in certain scenarios, privilege escalation if the attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The application uses `click.Path(exists=False)` for `dst_path`. This ensures that the provided destination path does not exist before writing, which can prevent accidental overwriting of existing files in the intended directory, but it does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `dst_path` is missing to prevent path traversal.
    - Using `click.Path` with `path_type=click.PathType(resolve_path=True, dir_okay=False, file_okay=True, path_type=str)` and enforcing a strict base path for allowed destination files would mitigate this vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `nodata blob` command and control the `dst_path` argument.
    - The application process must have write permissions to the directories targeted by the path traversal.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`nodata/scripts/cli.py`**:
        ```python
        @click.command(
            short_help="Blob + expand valid data area by (inter|extra)polation into"
                       "nodata areas")
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        ...
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy):
            """"""
            args = (src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                    creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
            blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
        ```
        - The `blob` command in `cli.py` defines `dst_path` as a `click.Path(exists=False)` argument.
        - `click.Path(exists=False)` only checks if the path does not exist but does not prevent path traversal.
        - The `dst_path` is directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function.

    2. **`nodata/blob.py`**:
        ```python
        def blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, maskThreshold, workers, alphafy):
            """
            """
            with rio.open(src_path) as src:
                ...
            with riomucho.RioMucho(
                    [src_path], dst_path, blob_worker,
                    windows=windows,
                    global_args={...},
                    options=options,
                    mode='manual_read') as rm:

                rm.run(workers)
        ```
        - Inside `RioMucho` context manager, `dst_path` is used as the output file path. `RioMucho` internally uses `rasterio.open(dst_path, 'w', **options)` to create the destination raster.
        - `rasterio.open()` with write mode ('w') will create and write to the file at the provided path without any path traversal protection.
        - Therefore, a malicious `dst_path` will be processed by `rasterio.open()`, leading to path traversal and arbitrary file write.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Access to the `nodata` command-line tool.
        - Write permissions in the `/tmp` directory (or another writable directory outside the intended working directory).
    2. **Steps:**
        - Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you can execute the `nodata` command.
        - Execute the following command, replacing `/path/to/source.tif` with a valid raster file path in your testing environment:
          ```bash
          nodata blob /path/to/source.tif /tmp/evil_file.tif
          ```
        - Check if the command executes without errors.
        - Verify if a file named `evil_file.tif` is created in the `/tmp` directory.
        - To further confirm, try writing to a path traversal sequence. Assume you want to write to `/tmp/evil_traversal.tif` from a current working directory that is a few levels deep from the root. Execute:
          ```bash
          nodata blob /path/to/source.tif ../../../tmp/evil_traversal.tif
          ```
          If this command works and creates `evil_traversal.tif` in `/tmp`, it confirms path traversal and arbitrary file write.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The command should create a raster file at `/tmp/evil_file.tif` or `/tmp/evil_traversal.tif` (depending on the test case), confirming the path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability. The content of the file will be the blobbed version of the source raster, but the critical point is the ability to write to an arbitrary location.
