- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in File Paths (SRC_PATH and DST_PATH)
- Description:
    - The application processes geospatial raster images based on user-provided source (`SRC_PATH`) and destination (`DST_PATH`) file paths via command-line arguments.
    - An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability by crafting malicious `SRC_PATH` or `DST_PATH` values that include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
    - By providing a malicious `SRC_PATH`, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system that the application process has access to.
    - By providing a malicious `DST_PATH`, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system that the application process has write access to, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones in unexpected locations.
    - The vulnerability is located in the `nodata/scripts/cli.py` and `nodata/blob.py` files, where user-supplied paths are directly used in file operations without proper sanitization.
- Impact:
    - **Read Arbitrary Files:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, application code, or user data, depending on the permissions of the application process.
    - **Write Arbitrary Files:** An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations, potentially leading to:
        - **Data corruption:** Overwriting critical system files or application data.
        - **Code execution:** Writing malicious scripts to locations where they can be executed by the system or other users.
        - **Denial of Service:** Filling up disk space or overwriting important files causing application or system malfunction.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application directly uses the provided paths without any sanitization or validation against path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization:** Implement path sanitization to remove path traversal sequences from `SRC_PATH` and `DST_PATH` before using them in file operations. Use functions like `os.path.basename()` to extract only the filename and ensure that the path is within the intended working directory.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the provided paths to ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain malicious sequences.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application process runs with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `nodata` command-line application with control over the `SRC_PATH` or `DST_PATH` parameters. This could be through direct command-line access or via a web application or service that uses this command-line tool.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `nodata/scripts/cli.py`**
        ```python
        @click.command(
            short_help="Blob + expand valid data area by (inter|extra)polation into"
                    "nodata areas")
        @click.argument('src_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        @click.argument('dst_path', type=click.Path(exists=False))
        ...
        def blob(src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy):
            """"""
            args = (src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                    creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
            blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, mask_threshold, jobs, alphafy)
        ```
        - The `cli.py` script defines the command-line interface using `click`.
        - It takes `src_path` and `dst_path` as arguments using `click.Path`.
        - `click.Path(exists=True)` and `click.Path(exists=False)` only perform basic checks on path existence but do not sanitize against path traversal.
        - The `src_path` and `dst_path` are directly passed to the `blob_nodata` function in `nodata/blob.py`.

    - **File: `nodata/blob.py`**
        ```python
        import rasterio as rio
        ...
        def blob_nodata(
                src_path, dst_path, bidx, max_search_distance, nibblemask,
                creation_options, maskThreshold, workers, alphafy):
            """
            """
            with rio.open(src_path) as src: # Vulnerable line - src_path directly used
                windows = [
                    [window, ij] for ij, window in src.block_windows()
                ]
                ...
            with riomucho.RioMucho(
                    [src_path], dst_path, blob_worker, # Vulnerable line - src_path and dst_path directly used
                    windows=windows,
                    global_args={
                        'max_search_distance': max_search_distance,
                        'nibblemask': nibblemask,
                        'bands': bidx,
                        'maskThreshold': maskThreshold,
                        'selectNodata': selectNodata
                    },
                    options=options,
                    mode='manual_read') as rm:

                rm.run(workers)
        ```
        - The `blob_nodata` function in `blob.py` receives `src_path` and `dst_path`.
        - `rio.open(src_path)` directly opens the file specified by `src_path` without any sanitization. This is where the path traversal vulnerability is exploited for reading files.
        - `riomucho.RioMucho([src_path], dst_path, ...)` also uses `src_path` and `dst_path` directly, making it vulnerable for both reading and writing.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure the `nodata` command-line tool is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
        - Create a test file (e.g., `test.tif`) in the current working directory to be used as a dummy destination file if needed.
    2. **Test Scenario:** Attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file using path traversal in `SRC_PATH`.
    3. **Command to execute:**
        ```bash
        nodata blob ../../../../../../../etc/passwd test.tif
        ```
        - Here, `SRC_PATH` is set to `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, which is a path traversal sequence aiming to access the `/etc/passwd` file.
        - `DST_PATH` is set to `test.tif`, a dummy file in the current directory, as a destination is required by the command.
    4. **Expected Outcome:**
        - The application attempts to open and process `/etc/passwd` as a raster image.
        - Due to `/etc/passwd` not being a valid raster image, `rasterio.open()` will likely raise an exception, and the program will exit with a non-zero exit code and print an error message.
        - **Successful Exploitation (Reading):** Even though the program might fail to process `/etc/passwd` as an image, the attempt to open it demonstrates that path traversal is possible, and an attacker could potentially read other accessible files by adjusting the path traversal sequence and providing a valid destination path.
    5. **Verification:**
        - Check the error message output. It should indicate an issue with opening or reading `/etc/passwd`, confirming that the application tried to access the file specified through path traversal.
        - While this test case might not perfectly demonstrate reading the *content* of `/etc/passwd` due to file format incompatibility, it effectively proves the **path traversal vulnerability** by showing that the application attempts to access a file outside the intended working directory based on the malicious input `SRC_PATH`.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by crafting a malicious `SRC_PATH`. While writing arbitrary files through `DST_PATH` is also a potential risk, reading sensitive system files is often considered a more direct and immediate security concern.
