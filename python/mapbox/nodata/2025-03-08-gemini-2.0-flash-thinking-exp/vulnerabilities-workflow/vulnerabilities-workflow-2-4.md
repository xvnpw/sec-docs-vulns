### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Source File Path
- Description:
    1.  The `nodata blob` command in `nodata/scripts/cli.py` takes `src_path` as an argument, which specifies the input raster file.
    2.  The `src_path` is passed to the `blob_nodata` function in `nodata/blob.py`.
    3.  The `blob_nodata` function directly uses `src_path` in `rasterio.open(src_path)` to open the input raster file.
    4.  The application does not sanitize or validate the `src_path`.
    5.  A malicious user can provide a crafted `src_path` containing path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside the intended directory.
    6.  For example, an attacker could provide `../README.md` as `src_path` if `README.md` is located in the parent directory of the application's working directory, potentially reading the content of `README.md` or other sensitive files if permissions allow.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized File Read: An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server if the application process has the necessary permissions. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, source code, or user data, depending on the server's file system layout and permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application uses `click.Path(exists=True)` for `src_path`, which only checks if the file exists but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input path sanitization: The application should sanitize the `src_path` to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done by:
        - Validating that the path is within an expected directory or subdirectory.
        - Using functions that resolve paths to their canonical form and checking if the resolved path is still within the allowed directory.
        - Blacklisting or removing path traversal sequences like `../` and `./`. However, blacklisting is generally less robust than whitelisting or path canonicalization.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to execute the `nodata blob` command.
    - The application must be running in a context where it has permissions to read files outside of its intended working directory, based on the crafted path.

        - Line 8-9: `click.argument` defines `src_path` and `dst_path` as command-line arguments. `click.Path(exists=True)` for `src_path` only ensures the file exists, and `click.Path(exists=False)` for `dst_path` ensures it doesn't exist. Neither prevents path traversal.

                    [window, ij] for ij, window in src.block_windows()
                ]

                options = src.meta.copy()

        ```
        - Line 87: `rasterio.open(src_path)` opens the raster file using the user-provided `src_path` without any sanitization. This is where the path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
        - Line 114: `riomucho.RioMucho([src_path], dst_path, ...)` also uses `src_path` and `dst_path` without sanitization.

- Security Test Case:
    1.  Assume the application is run from a directory, e.g., `/home/user/nodata_project/`.
    2.  Create a file named `sensitive_data.txt` in the parent directory, `/home/user/`, with some sensitive content, e.g., "This is sensitive information.".
    3.  Execute the `nodata blob` command with a crafted `src_path` to attempt to access `sensitive_data.txt` using path traversal:
        ```bash
        nodata blob ../sensitive_data.txt output.tif
        ```
    4.  Observe the output and error messages. If the path traversal is successful, `rasterio.open()` might attempt to open and process `sensitive_data.txt` as a raster file, which will likely cause an error because it's not a valid raster file format. However, if successful, it might read metadata or attempt to process the content, confirming the vulnerability. Even if it fails, the attempt to open a file outside the intended directory demonstrates the path traversal vulnerability.
    5.  To further confirm, create a dummy valid tif file (e.g., `dummy.tif`) in the current directory.
    6.  Execute the command again, but this time redirect the output to a file:
        ```bash
        nodata blob ../sensitive_data.txt output.tif 2> error.log
        ```
    7.  Examine the `error.log` file. If the error message indicates that the application tried to open or access `/home/user/sensitive_data.txt`, it confirms that path traversal is possible via the `src_path` parameter. The exact error message might vary depending on how `rasterio` handles non-raster files or permission issues, but any indication of accessing the file outside the expected application directory validates the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Destination File Path
- Description:
    1.  The `nodata blob` command in `nodata/scripts/cli.py` takes `dst_path` as an argument, which specifies the output raster file path.
    2.  The `dst_path` is passed to the `blob_nodata` function in `nodata/blob.py`.
    3.  The `blob_nodata` function directly uses `dst_path` in `riomucho.RioMucho` as the destination path for writing the processed raster file.
    4.  The application does not sanitize or validate the `dst_path`.
    5.  A malicious user can provide a crafted `dst_path` containing path traversal sequences like `../` to write files outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting sensitive files or creating files in unintended locations.
    6.  For example, an attacker could provide `../output.tif` as `dst_path` to write the output file in the parent directory of the application's working directory.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized File Write/Overwrite: An attacker could write arbitrary files to the server if the application process has the necessary permissions. This could lead to:
        - Data corruption or modification by overwriting existing files.
        - Planting malicious files in unexpected locations.
        - Potentially achieving code execution in some scenarios if an attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application uses `click.Path(exists=False)` for `dst_path`, which only checks if the file does not exist but does not prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output path sanitization: The application should sanitize the `dst_path` to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done using the same methods as for `src_path` sanitization:
        - Validating that the path is within an expected directory or subdirectory.
        - Using functions that resolve paths to their canonical form and checking if the resolved path is still within the allowed directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to execute the `nodata blob` command.
    - The application must be running in a context where it has permissions to write files outside of its intended working directory, based on the crafted path.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/nodata/scripts/cli.py`
        - (Same as Path Traversal in Source File Path analysis for `cli.py`)
    - File: `/code/nodata/blob.py`
        - (Same as Path Traversal in Source File Path analysis for `blob.py`, focusing on Line 114: `riomucho.RioMucho([src_path], dst_path, ...)` where `dst_path` is used as the output destination.)

- Security Test Case:
    1.  Assume the application is run from a directory, e.g., `/home/user/nodata_project/`.
    2.  Create a dummy valid tif file named `input.tif` in the current directory.
    3.  Execute the `nodata blob` command with a crafted `dst_path` to attempt to write the output file in the parent directory, e.g., `/home/user/output.tif`:
        ```bash
        nodata blob input.tif ../output.tif
        ```
    4.  After execution, check if a file named `output.tif` is created in the parent directory `/home/user/`. If the file is created in the parent directory instead of the current working directory, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability in `dst_path`.
    5.  To verify further, try to overwrite an existing file in the parent directory if permissions allow. For example, if there is an existing non-sensitive file named `existing_file.txt` in `/home/user/`, try to overwrite it:
        ```bash
        nodata blob input.tif ../existing_file.txt
        ```
    6.  Check the content of `../existing_file.txt` after execution. If it has been modified or overwritten with raster data, it further confirms the path traversal and file overwrite vulnerability via the `dst_path` parameter.
