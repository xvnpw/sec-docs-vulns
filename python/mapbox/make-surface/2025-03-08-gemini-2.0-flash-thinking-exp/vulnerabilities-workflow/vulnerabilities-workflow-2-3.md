- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `vectorize` command via `infile` parameter

- Description:
  An attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability in the `makesurface vectorize` command by providing a maliciously crafted file path as the `infile` parameter. This can allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
  1.  The attacker uses the `makesurface vectorize` command.
  2.  For the `infile` parameter, the attacker provides a path that traverses outside of the intended directory, such as "../../../etc/passwd".
  3.  The `vectorizeRaster` function in `vectorize_raster.py` uses `rasterio.open(infile, 'r')` to open the file specified by the `infile` parameter.
  4.  `rasterio.open` attempts to open the file at the provided path without proper sanitization.
  5.  If the system allows and the file exists, `rasterio.open` will successfully open and read the file, even if it is outside the intended directory.
  6.  The content of the file, though not directly outputted to the command line in a readable format, can be processed by the application, and depending on further logic, could lead to information disclosure or other unexpected behaviors. While the tool is designed to process raster files, the underlying vulnerability allows access to any file readable by the process.

- Impact:
  High. An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. This could include configuration files, application code, or user data, depending on the server's setup and file permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  None. The application directly uses the user-provided file path with `rasterio.open` without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
  Input validation and sanitization for the `infile` parameter in the `vectorize` command.
  Specifically:
  *   Path sanitization: Sanitize the input path to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like "../" and "..\" before passing it to `rasterio.open`.
  *   Path validation: Validate that the provided path is within the expected directory or allowed paths.
  *   Principle of least privilege: Ensure the application runs with minimal necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful path traversal.

- Preconditions:
  1.  The attacker must have access to execute the `makesurface vectorize` command.
  2.  The application must be running in an environment where it has read permissions to the files the attacker wants to access (which is often the case for web servers or applications running with user privileges).

- Source Code Analysis:
  1.  File: `makesurface/scripts/cli.py`
  2.  Function: `vectorize`
  3.  The `infile` parameter is defined as:
      ```python
      @click.argument('infile', type=str)
      ```
      It is taken as a string without any path validation using `click.Path` with `exists=True` or `dir_okay=False` or similar options that could restrict the path.
  4.  This `infile` argument is directly passed to the `makesurface.vectorize` function:
      ```python
      makesurface.vectorize(infile, outfile, classes, classfile, weight, nodata, smoothing, bidx, carto, axonometrize, nosimple, setnodata, nibble, outvar)
      ```
  5.  File: `makesurface/__init__.py`
  6.  Function: `vectorize`
  7.  This function then calls `vectorize_raster.vectorizeRaster` passing the `infile` argument directly:
      ```python
      vectorize_raster.vectorizeRaster(infile, outfile, classes, classfile, weight, nodata, smoothing, bidx, cartoCSS, axonometrize, nosimple, setNoData, nibbleMask, outvar)
      ```
  8.  File: `makesurface/scripts/vectorize_raster.py`
  9.  Function: `vectorizeRaster`
  10. The `infile` parameter is used in `rasterio.open`:
      ```python
      with rasterio.open(infile, 'r') as src:
          # ... rest of the code
      ```
  11. `rasterio.open` as used here will attempt to open the file at the exact path provided in the `infile` variable. There is no path sanitization or validation before this call, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

- Security Test Case:
  1.  Prerequisites:
      *   A publicly accessible instance of the `makesurface` application is running.
      *   The attacker has access to a command-line interface to execute `makesurface` commands.
  2.  Test Steps:
      *   Open a terminal and execute the following command, attempting to read the `/etc/passwd` file (or any other sensitive file accessible to the application's user):
          ```bash
          makesurface vectorize ../../../../etc/passwd --outfile output.json
          ```
      *   Examine the `output.json` file. While the content might not be directly readable as text due to the tool's processing of raster data, any successful processing without error and creation of `output.json` indicates that `rasterio.open` was able to access and read the file specified by the path.
      *   Alternatively, observe for error messages. If the command executes without file access errors from `rasterio`, it suggests successful file opening, even if the output is not as expected for a raster file. A successful path traversal would mean the command attempts to process `/etc/passwd` as a raster file, which will likely lead to errors later in the process, but the initial file opening by `rasterio.open` is the point of vulnerability.
  3.  Expected Result:
      *   Ideally, the application should prevent accessing `/etc/passwd` and throw an error indicating invalid input or restricted access.
      *   In a vulnerable application, the command will likely execute without immediately rejecting the path, and attempt to process `/etc/passwd` as a raster file. While the tool might error out later due to `/etc/passwd` not being a valid raster, the vulnerability lies in the fact that `rasterio.open` attempted to open and possibly read a file outside the intended input directory.
