### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration File
* Description:
    1. The application stores sensitive information, including Dynatrace API tokens, Twilio API tokens, and webhook basic authentication credentials, in a plain text JSON file named `config.json`.
    2. An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the filesystem where the `config.json` file is located. This could be achieved through various methods, such as exploiting web server misconfigurations, operating system vulnerabilities, or social engineering.
    3. Once the attacker reads the `config.json` file, they can extract sensitive credentials.
    4. With the Dynatrace API token, the attacker can access the Dynatrace API, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification of Dynatrace settings, or disruption of Dynatrace monitoring.
    5. With the Twilio API token, the attacker can access the Twilio API, potentially leading to SMS abuse and financial charges.
    6. With the webhook basic authentication credentials, the attacker might attempt to bypass the intended authentication mechanism of the webhook itself, although the primary risk is the compromise of Dynatrace and Twilio accounts.
* Impact:
    * High - Unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace and Twilio accounts.
    * Potential data breaches from Dynatrace.
    * Unauthorized actions within the Dynatrace environment.
    * Financial costs due to SMS abuse via Twilio.
    * Reputational damage.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * Basic authentication is implemented for the webhook endpoint `/` using Flask-BasicAuth. Credentials for this authentication are stored in `config.json`.
    * No mitigations are implemented to protect the `config.json` file itself from unauthorized access.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **File System Permissions**: Restrict file system permissions on `config.json` to ensure only the application user (and potentially system administrators) can read it. This is a standard security practice to limit access to sensitive configuration files.
    * **Encryption of Sensitive Data**: Encrypt sensitive values within the `config.json` file. This could involve using a secrets management solution or a simpler encryption method. Decryption would need to be implemented in the `webhook.py` application during startup.
* Preconditions:
    * The webhook application is deployed, and the `config.json` file is present in the application directory.
    * An attacker must gain unauthorized read access to the filesystem where the `config.json` file is stored.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `webhook.py`, the `config.json` file is loaded directly using `config = json.load(open('config.json'))` without any access control or decryption mechanisms.
    ```python
    # Read Configuration and assign the variables
    config = json.load(open('config.json'))
    ```
    2. Subsequently, sensitive configuration parameters are directly accessed from the `config` object and assigned to variables, including:
        * `API_TOKEN = config['dynatrace']['api_token']`
        * `USERNAME = config['webhook']['username']`
        * `PASSWORD = config['webhook']['password']`
        * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT = config['sms_notification']['twilio_account']`
        * `TWILIO_TOKEN = config['sms_notification']['twilio_token']`
    3. These variables containing sensitive information are then used throughout the application, for example, `API_TOKEN` is used to authenticate API requests to Dynatrace, and `TWILIO_TOKEN` is used to authenticate with the Twilio API.
    4. The `README.md` file explicitly instructs users to store sensitive information such as Dynatrace API tokens and Twilio API tokens in the `config.json` file, highlighting the intended use of this file for storing secrets.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Deploy the webhook application to a test server (e.g., a cloud VM). Ensure the webhook is running and accessible via HTTP on port 5000.
    2. **Identify `config.json` Location**: Determine the absolute path to the `config.json` file on the server. This is typically in the same directory as `webhook.py` if deployed as described in the README.
    3. **Attempt Direct File Access**: As an external attacker, attempt to access the `config.json` file directly via HTTP. This step is highly dependent on the web server configuration. In a typical secure setup, direct access to application files should be prevented. However, misconfigurations can occur. For example, try accessing URLs like:
        * `http://<webhook-server-ip>:5000/config.json`
        * `http://<webhook-server-ip>:5000/code/config.json` (if the `/code` path is accessible)
        * `http://<webhook-server-ip>:5000/../config.json` (path traversal attempt, might be blocked by web server)
    4. **Simulate OS-Level Access (Alternative)**: If direct HTTP access fails (as expected in a properly configured web server), simulate a scenario where an attacker has gained limited OS-level access (e.g., through another vulnerability or insider access). Use SSH or a similar method to access the server as a low-privileged user (if possible, or assume read access to the application directory).
    5. **Read `config.json`**: Using OS-level access (or if direct HTTP access was successful), read the content of the `config.json` file. For example, using `cat /path/to/config.json` in a shell.
    6. **Extract Secrets**: Examine the content of `config.json` and extract the Dynatrace API token (`dynatrace.api_token`), Twilio API token (`sms_notification.twilio_token`), and basic auth credentials (`webhook.username`, `webhook.password`).
    7. **Verify Dynatrace API Access**: Use the extracted Dynatrace API token to make a request to the Dynatrace API. For example, using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token <extracted_dynatrace_api_token>" "<your_dynatrace_tenant>/api/v1/problem/feed/?relativeTime=hour"
        ```
        A successful response (HTTP 200 with problem data) confirms unauthorized API access.
    8. **Verify Twilio API Access**: Use the extracted Twilio API token and account SID to make a request to the Twilio API. For example, attempt to send an SMS message using the Twilio CLI or API. Successful SMS sending confirms unauthorized Twilio access.
    9. **Impact Confirmation**: Successful unauthorized access to Dynatrace and Twilio APIs using the extracted credentials demonstrates the sensitive information exposure vulnerability and its potential impact.
