#### 1. Command Injection in Legacy Script Execution

- **Description:**
    1.  An attacker can manipulate data within a Dynatrace problem notification.
    2.  The Dynatrace webhook application receives this notification and extracts data from it without proper sanitization.
    3.  Specifically, the `get_program_argument` function in `webhook.py` constructs command line arguments for the legacy script (`legacy_script.bat` or `legacy_script.sh`) by directly using values from the Dynatrace problem details, including fields like `displayName`, `status`, `severityLevel`, `impactLevel`, `tagsOfAffectedEntities`, `entityName`, `eventType`.
    4.  The `call_incident_software` function then executes the configured legacy script using `subprocess.call` with `shell=True`, passing the unsanitized arguments.
    5.  Due to `shell=True`, an attacker can inject malicious commands by crafting a Dynatrace problem notification with specially crafted values in fields used to construct the command arguments. For example, by injecting shell metacharacters like backticks, semicolons, or pipes into the `entityName` within the Dynatrace problem notification payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the webhook application.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the webhook application is running with the privileges of the user running the webhook process. This can lead to full system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application does not perform any input sanitization on the data received from Dynatrace problem notifications before passing it as arguments to the legacy scripts.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization within the `get_program_argument` function in `webhook.py`. Sanitize all input strings from the Dynatrace problem notification to remove or escape shell metacharacters before constructing command arguments. Use a safe escaping mechanism appropriate for the shell being used (e.g., `shlex.quote` in Python for POSIX shells).
    - **Use `subprocess.run` with Argument List and `shell=False`:** Instead of using `subprocess.call(EXECUTABLE + ' ' + argument, shell=True)`, refactor the code to use `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and pass the executable and arguments as a list. This approach avoids shell interpretation of the arguments and significantly reduces the risk of command injection. Reconstruct `get_program_argument` to return a list of arguments instead of a single string.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the webhook application and the legacy scripts run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running them as root or with highly privileged accounts.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `incident_notification.active` setting in `config.json` must be set to `true`.
    - Dynatrace problem notifications must be configured to send notifications to this webhook.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the data within Dynatrace problem notifications, which can be achieved by triggering or manipulating monitored entities in Dynatrace that lead to problem creation, or potentially by directly interacting with Dynatrace API if they have sufficient privileges within Dynatrace environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`webhook.py` - `call_incident_software` function:**
        ```python
        def call_incident_software(problem_details):
            # ...
            argument_list = get_program_argument(problem_details)
            # ...
            for argument in argument_list:
                return_code = (subprocess.call(EXECUTABLE + ' ' + argument, shell=True))
                # ...
        ```
        This code snippet shows that `subprocess.call` is used with `shell=True`, making it vulnerable to command injection if the `argument` variable contains malicious shell commands.

    2.  **`webhook.py` - `get_program_argument` function:**
        ```python
        def get_program_argument(problem_details):
            # ...
            msg = "Problem [{0}]: Status={1}, Severity={2}, ImpactLevel={3}, Tags={4}".format(nr, status, severity, element, tags)
            # ...
            arguments_list = []
            for element in elements:
                e_name = element['entityName']
                # ...
                element_msg = msg
                element_msg += " Entity details: Entity={0}, impactLevel={1}, severity={2}, eventType={3}".format(e_name, e_severity, e_impact, e_eventType)
                arguments_list.append(element_msg)

            return arguments_list
        ```
        This function constructs the `argument` string by directly embedding values like `e_name` (entity name) from `problem_details` without any sanitization. If an attacker can control the `entityName` in the Dynatrace problem notification, they can inject malicious commands into `element_msg` and subsequently into the command executed by `subprocess.call`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Dynatrace Problem Notification --> Webhook Application (webhook.py) --> get_program_argument() --> Unsanitized Input (e.g., entityName) --> subprocess.call(..., shell=True) --> Command Injection --> Remote Code Execution
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure the webhook application is running and accessible.
        - Ensure `incident_notification.active` is set to `true` in `config.json`.
        - Configure a Dynatrace problem notification to send to the webhook endpoint with basic authentication.

    2.  **Craft Malicious Dynatrace Problem Notification:**
        - Create a Dynatrace problem notification payload (JSON) that includes a malicious command in one of the fields that is used to construct the command line arguments for the legacy script. A good field to target is `entityName` within the `rankedImpacts` or `rankedEvents` section of the problem details.
        - For example, to execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned`, craft a payload where `entityName` is set to:
          ```json
          "entityName": "$(touch /tmp/pwned)"
          ```
          or
          ```json
          "entityName": "`touch /tmp/pwned`"
          ```
          or using other shell injection techniques appropriate for the target OS (Linux/Windows). You can also try more direct commands like `; touch /tmp/pwned;` or `& touch /tmp/pwned &`.

        - A complete minimal malicious JSON payload for Dynatrace custom notification could look like this (adjust other fields as needed for Dynatrace to accept the notification):
          ```json
          {
            "State": "OPEN",
            "ProblemID": "INJECT-TEST-123",
            "PID": "12345",
            "ImpactedEntities": [
              {
                "entityName": "`touch /tmp/pwned`",
                "severityLevel": "ERROR",
                "impactLevel": "APPLICATION"
              }
            ]
          }
          ```
          **Note:**  This is a simplified example payload. Real Dynatrace notifications are more complex. You might need to adapt it to resemble a valid Dynatrace problem notification structure while injecting the malicious payload into a relevant field. You may need to examine the structure of a real Dynatrace problem notification to construct a valid malicious payload.

    3.  **Trigger Dynatrace Problem Notification:**
        - In Dynatrace, trigger a problem notification that will send the crafted malicious payload to the webhook. This could be done by:
            - Manually triggering a custom event in Dynatrace that generates a problem notification.
            - Waiting for a real problem to occur in a monitored application or infrastructure in Dynatrace.
            - Using Dynatrace API to simulate a problem and send a notification.
        - Ensure that the Dynatrace problem notification configuration is set to use the webhook URL and authentication configured for the Flask application.

    4.  **Verify Command Execution:**
        - After triggering the Dynatrace problem notification, check the server hosting the webhook application.
        - Look for the execution of the injected command. In the example `touch /tmp/pwned`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the server.
        - You can also check the webhook application logs for any errors or unusual activity.

    5.  **Expected Result:**
        - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the server, indicating that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed by the webhook application due to command injection. This confirms the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
