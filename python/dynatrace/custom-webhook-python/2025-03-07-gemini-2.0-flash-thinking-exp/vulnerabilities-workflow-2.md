### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities within the webhook application. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, severity ranking, existing and missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

#### 1. Command Injection in Legacy Script Execution

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can manipulate data within a Dynatrace problem notification.
    2. The Dynatrace webhook application receives this notification and extracts data from it without proper sanitization.
    3. Specifically, the `get_program_argument` function in `webhook.py` constructs command line arguments for the legacy script (`legacy_script.bat` or `legacy_script.sh`) by directly using values from the Dynatrace problem details, including fields like `displayName`, `status`, `severityLevel`, `impactLevel`, `tagsOfAffectedEntities`, `entityName`, `eventType`.
    4. The `call_incident_software` function then executes the configured legacy script using `subprocess.call` with `shell=True`, passing the unsanitized arguments.
    5. Due to `shell=True`, an attacker can inject malicious commands by crafting a Dynatrace problem notification with specially crafted values in fields used to construct the command arguments. For example, by injecting shell metacharacters like backticks, semicolons, or pipes into the `entityName` within the Dynatrace problem notification payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the webhook application.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the webhook application is running with the privileges of the user running the webhook process. This can lead to full system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application does not perform any input sanitization on the data received from Dynatrace problem notifications before passing it as arguments to the legacy scripts.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization within the `get_program_argument` function in `webhook.py`. Sanitize all input strings from the Dynatrace problem notification to remove or escape shell metacharacters before constructing command arguments. Use a safe escaping mechanism appropriate for the shell being used (e.g., `shlex.quote` in Python for POSIX shells).
    - **Use `subprocess.run` with Argument List and `shell=False`:** Instead of using `subprocess.call(EXECUTABLE + ' ' + argument, shell=True)`, refactor the code to use `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and pass the executable and arguments as a list. This approach avoids shell interpretation of the arguments and significantly reduces the risk of command injection. Reconstruct `get_program_argument` to return a list of arguments instead of a single string.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the webhook application and the legacy scripts run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running them as root or with highly privileged accounts.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `incident_notification.active` setting in `config.json` must be set to `true`.
    - Dynatrace problem notifications must be configured to send notifications to this webhook.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the data within Dynatrace problem notifications, which can be achieved by triggering or manipulating monitored entities in Dynatrace that lead to problem creation, or potentially by directly interacting with Dynatrace API if they have sufficient privileges within Dynatrace environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`webhook.py` - `call_incident_software` function:**
        ```python
        def call_incident_software(problem_details):
            # ...
            argument_list = get_program_argument(problem_details)
            # ...
            for argument in argument_list:
                return_code = (subprocess.call(EXECUTABLE + ' ' + argument, shell=True))
                # ...
        ```
        This code snippet shows that `subprocess.call` is used with `shell=True`, making it vulnerable to command injection if the `argument` variable contains malicious shell commands.

    2.  **`webhook.py` - `get_program_argument` function:**
        ```python
        def get_program_argument(problem_details):
            # ...
            msg = "Problem [{0}]: Status={1}, Severity={2}, ImpactLevel={3}, Tags={4}".format(nr, status, severity, element, tags)
            # ...
            arguments_list = []
            for element in elements:
                e_name = element['entityName']
                # ...
                element_msg = msg
                element_msg += " Entity details: Entity={0}, impactLevel={1}, severity={2}, eventType={3}".format(e_name, e_severity, e_impact, e_eventType)
                arguments_list.append(element_msg)

            return arguments_list
        ```
        This function constructs the `argument` string by directly embedding values like `e_name` (entity name) from `problem_details` without any sanitization. If an attacker can control the `entityName` in the Dynatrace problem notification, they can inject malicious commands into `element_msg` and subsequently into the command executed by `subprocess.call`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Dynatrace Problem Notification --> Webhook Application (webhook.py) --> get_program_argument() --> Unsanitized Input (e.g., entityName) --> subprocess.call(..., shell=True) --> Command Injection --> Remote Code Execution
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure the webhook application is running and accessible.
        - Ensure `incident_notification.active` is set to `true` in `config.json`.
        - Configure a Dynatrace problem notification to send to the webhook endpoint with basic authentication.

    2.  **Craft Malicious Dynatrace Problem Notification:**
        - Create a Dynatrace problem notification payload (JSON) that includes a malicious command in one of the fields that is used to construct the command line arguments for the legacy script. A good field to target is `entityName` within the `rankedImpacts` or `rankedEvents` section of the problem details.
        - For example, to execute the command `touch /tmp/pwned`, craft a payload where `entityName` is set to:
          ```json
          "entityName": "$(touch /tmp/pwned)"
          ```

    3.  **Trigger Dynatrace Problem Notification:**
        - In Dynatrace, trigger a problem notification that will send the crafted malicious payload to the webhook.

    4.  **Verify Command Execution:**
        - After triggering the Dynatrace problem notification, check the server hosting the webhook application.
        - Look for the execution of the injected command. In the example `touch /tmp/pwned`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on the server.

    5.  **Expected Result:**
        - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the file `/tmp/pwned` should be created on the server, indicating that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed by the webhook application due to command injection. This confirms the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

#### 2. Remote Command Execution via Configurable Script Paths

- **Description:** An attacker who gains write access to the `config.json` file can modify the `exec_win` or `exec_unix` parameters within the `incident_notification` section. These parameters specify the paths to executable scripts that are intended to be used for legacy system integrations. By altering these paths to point to malicious scripts or commands, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server hosting the webhook. When Dynatrace sends a problem notification to the webhook and the `incident_notification.active` flag is set to `true`, the `call_integration` function, specifically `call_incident_software`, will execute the script located at the attacker-defined path. This execution happens via `subprocess.call` without sufficient sanitization or validation of the configured paths, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

- **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote command execution. An attacker can gain complete control over the webhook server, potentially leading to:
    - Data breach: Access to sensitive data stored on the server or accessible from it.
    - System compromise: Installation of malware, backdoors, or ransomware.
    - Denial of Service: Shutting down or disrupting the webhook service or other services on the server.
    - Lateral movement: Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Basic authentication is implemented for the webhook endpoint using Flask-BasicAuth. This requires users to authenticate with a username and password defined in `config.json` to access the webhook functionality. However, this mitigation does not prevent an attacker who has already gained write access to the filesystem and `config.json` from exploiting the vulnerability.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** The application lacks validation for the `exec_win` and `exec_unix` paths in `config.json`. It should verify that these paths are within a safe, predefined directory and that the executables are trusted. Ideally, the application should avoid executing external scripts based on user-provided paths altogether.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** The webhook application should be run with minimal necessary privileges. This would restrict the scope of damage an attacker can inflict even after achieving command execution.
    - **Configuration file protection:** Implement proper file system permissions to restrict write access to the `config.json` file. Only the administrator or authorized processes should be able to modify this file.
    - **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to the `config.json` file. Any change to this file should trigger an alert to the system administrators.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must gain write access to the `config.json` file on the server where the webhook is deployed.
    - The `incident_notification.active` setting in `config.json` must be set to `true` for the vulnerable code path to be executed.
    - Dynatrace must be configured to send problem notifications to the webhook endpoint.
    - A Dynatrace problem must occur and trigger a notification to the webhook.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `webhook.py` script begins by loading configuration data from `config.json` using `json.load(open('config.json'))`.
    - It retrieves the executable paths from the configuration:
      ```python
      EXEC_WIN = config['incident_notification']['exec_win']
      EXEC_UNIX = config['incident_notification']['exec_unix']
      INCIDENT_NOTIFICATION = config['incident_notification']['active']
      ```
    - Within `call_incident_software`, the script determines the operating system and selects the corresponding executable path (`EXEC_WIN` or `EXEC_UNIX`) from the configuration:
      ```python
      if os.name == 'nt':
          EXECUTABLE = EXEC_WIN
      else:
          EXECUTABLE = EXEC_UNIX
      ```
    - Finally, the script executes the configured executable using `subprocess.call`:
      ```python
      return_code = (subprocess.call(EXECUTABLE + ' ' + argument, shell=True))
      ```
      **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that `EXECUTABLE` is directly derived from the `config.json` file without any validation or sanitization. An attacker who can modify `config.json` can set `EXEC_WIN` or `EXEC_UNIX` to an arbitrary command, which will then be executed by the `subprocess.call` function when a Dynatrace notification is processed.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup: Deploy the webhook application on a test server and ensure it is running. Configure Dynatrace to send problem notifications to this webhook. Simulate gaining write access to the `config.json` file.
    2. Modify `config.json`: Edit the `config.json` file on the webhook server. Locate the `incident_notification` section and modify `exec_unix` (if the server is Linux) or `exec_win` (if Windows) to point to a command that will create a file in a publicly accessible directory, for example: `/bin/touch /tmp/webhook_pwned` for Linux.
    3. Trigger Dynatrace Notification: In Dynatrace, trigger a problem notification to be sent to the webhook.
    4. Verify Command Execution: After triggering the notification, access the webhook server and check for the created file `/tmp/webhook_pwned` (for Linux).
    5. Successful Exploitation: If the file has been successfully created, it confirms that the command injected via `config.json` was executed, demonstrating the Remote Command Execution vulnerability.

#### 3. Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration File

- **Description:**
    1. The application stores sensitive information, including Dynatrace API tokens, Twilio API tokens, and webhook basic authentication credentials, in a plain text JSON file named `config.json`.
    2. An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the filesystem where the `config.json` file is located.
    3. Once the attacker reads the `config.json` file, they can extract sensitive credentials.
    4. With the Dynatrace API token, the attacker can access the Dynatrace API, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification of Dynatrace settings, or disruption of Dynatrace monitoring.
    5. With the Twilio API token, the attacker can access the Twilio API, potentially leading to SMS abuse and financial charges.
    6. With the webhook basic authentication credentials, the attacker might attempt to bypass the intended authentication mechanism of the webhook itself, although the primary risk is the compromise of Dynatrace and Twilio accounts.

- **Impact:**
    * High - Unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace and Twilio accounts.
    * Potential data breaches from Dynatrace.
    * Unauthorized actions within the Dynatrace environment.
    * Financial costs due to SMS abuse via Twilio.
    * Reputational damage.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * Basic authentication is implemented for the webhook endpoint `/` using Flask-BasicAuth. Credentials for this authentication are stored in `config.json`.
    * No mitigations are implemented to protect the `config.json` file itself from unauthorized access.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    * **File System Permissions**: Restrict file system permissions on `config.json` to ensure only the application user (and potentially system administrators) can read it.
    * **Encryption of Sensitive Data**: Encrypt sensitive values within the `config.json` file. This could involve using a secrets management solution or a simpler encryption method.

- **Preconditions:**
    * The webhook application is deployed, and the `config.json` file is present in the application directory.
    * An attacker must gain unauthorized read access to the filesystem where the `config.json` file is stored.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `webhook.py`, the `config.json` file is loaded directly using `config = json.load(open('config.json'))` without any access control or decryption mechanisms.
    ```python
    # Read Configuration and assign the variables
    config = json.load(open('config.json'))
    ```
    2. Sensitive configuration parameters are directly accessed from the `config` object and assigned to variables, including:
        * `API_TOKEN = config['dynatrace']['api_token']`
        * `USERNAME = config['webhook']['username']`
        * `PASSWORD = config['webhook']['password']`
        * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT = config['sms_notification']['twilio_account']`
        * `TWILIO_TOKEN = config['sms_notification']['twilio_token']`

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup**: Deploy the webhook application to a test server.
    2. **Identify `config.json` Location**: Determine the absolute path to the `config.json` file on the server.
    3. **Attempt Direct File Access or Simulate OS-Level Access**: Attempt to access the `config.json` file directly via HTTP (if misconfigured) or simulate OS-level access.
    4. **Read `config.json`**: Read the content of the `config.json` file.
    5. **Extract Secrets**: Examine the content of `config.json` and extract the Dynatrace API token, Twilio API token, and basic auth credentials.
    6. **Verify Dynatrace API Access**: Use the extracted Dynatrace API token to make a request to the Dynatrace API.
    7. **Verify Twilio API Access**: Use the extracted Twilio API token and account SID to make a request to the Twilio API.
    8. **Impact Confirmation**: Successful unauthorized access to Dynatrace and Twilio APIs using the extracted credentials demonstrates the sensitive information exposure vulnerability.
