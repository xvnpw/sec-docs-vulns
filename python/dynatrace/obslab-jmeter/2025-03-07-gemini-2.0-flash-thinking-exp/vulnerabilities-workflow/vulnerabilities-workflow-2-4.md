### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Dynatrace API Token Exposure via Publicly Shared Codespace URL
- Description:
    1. A user following the tutorial is instructed to create a Dynatrace API token with specific permissions and set it as an environment variable named `DT_API_TOKEN` in their GitHub Codespace.
    2. The tutorial implicitly relies on the private nature of GitHub Codespaces for security.
    3. If a user mistakenly shares their Codespace URL publicly (for example, by posting it in a public forum for help, or accidentally making their Codespace public if GitHub allows this), an attacker could potentially gain access to the running Codespace environment.
    4. An attacker who gains access to the Codespace URL can access the Codespace environment.
    5. Once inside the Codespace environment, the attacker can access the `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable, which contains the Dynatrace API token.
    6. With the exposed Dynatrace API token, the attacker can then make authenticated requests to the victim's Dynatrace environment, leveraging the permissions associated with the token.
- Impact:
    Unauthorized access to the victim's Dynatrace environment. The severity of the impact depends on the permissions granted to the exposed API token. In this tutorial, the requested permissions include `ReadConfig`, `DataExport`, `CaptureRequestData`, and `openpipeline.events_sdlc`.  An attacker could potentially:
    - Read sensitive configuration data from the Dynatrace tenant (`ReadConfig`).
    - Export monitoring data, potentially including performance metrics and other telemetry data (`DataExport`).
    - Capture request data, potentially gaining insights into application traffic (`CaptureRequestData`).
    - Send arbitrary SDLC events to the Dynatrace tenant, potentially disrupting workflows or manipulating test results (`openpipeline.events_sdlc`).
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    There are no specific mitigations implemented within the project to prevent this vulnerability. The security relies solely on the user's awareness and responsible handling of their Codespace URL. The documentation does not explicitly warn against the risks of sharing the Codespace URL in the context of API token security.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Explicit Security Warning in Documentation:** The documentation should include a clear and prominent warning about the risks of publicly sharing the Codespace URL, emphasizing that it could expose the Dynatrace API token and grant unauthorized access to their Dynatrace environment. This warning should be placed in the "Getting Started" section, near the instructions for setting the `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
    - **Consider Time-Limited Tokens:** While not a direct mitigation for sharing Codespace URLs, recommending or automatically configuring API tokens with a limited lifespan could reduce the window of opportunity for misuse if a token is exposed. However, this might complicate the tutorial's setup process. The primary mitigation is a clear warning.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim user successfully sets up the Dynatrace API token as an environment variable `DT_API_TOKEN` in their GitHub Codespace, following the tutorial.
    2. The victim user inadvertently shares their GitHub Codespace URL publicly.
    3. An attacker gains access to this publicly shared Codespace URL.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not directly within the provided source code files, but rather in the tutorial's design and the inherent security considerations of using environment variables in cloud-based development environments like GitHub Codespaces.
    - `environment_installer.py` script correctly retrieves the `DT_API_TOKEN` from the environment variables:
      ```python
      DT_API_TOKEN = os.environ.get("DT_API_TOKEN") # token to create all other tokens
      ```
    - This token is then used to replace placeholders in configuration files:
      ```python
      do_file_replace(pattern=f"{BASE_DIR}/jmeterscripts/example.jmx", find_string="DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER", replace_string=DT_API_TOKEN)
      ```
    - The code itself handles the token in a standard way for environment variables. The vulnerability arises from the lack of explicit warnings in the tutorial about the risks associated with sharing access to the environment where this variable is stored.
    - The `docs/getting-started.md` file guides users to create an API token and use it, but lacks explicit warning about the risks of exposing the Codespace URL.
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:** Complete the "Getting Started" steps of the tutorial to create a GitHub Codespace for the project and configure it with a Dynatrace API token as the `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Use a Dynatrace API token with the permissions specified in the tutorial (`ReadConfig`, `DataExport`, `CaptureRequestData`, `openpipeline.events_sdlc`) for a non-production Dynatrace environment to avoid risking sensitive data.
    2. **Simulate Public Codespace URL Sharing:**  Assume the user accidentally shares their Codespace URL. For testing purposes, the attacker can be someone you explicitly grant the Codespace URL to, or simulate a scenario where the URL becomes publicly known.
    3. **Attacker Access Codespace:** The attacker opens the shared Codespace URL in a web browser, gaining access to the Codespace environment.
    4. **Access Environment Variable:** The attacker opens a new terminal within the Codespace (e.g., using the "+" icon and selecting "New Terminal").
    5. **Retrieve API Token:** In the terminal, the attacker executes the command `echo $DT_API_TOKEN`.
    6. **Verify Token Exposure:** Observe that the Dynatrace API token is displayed as the output of the command in the terminal, confirming that the attacker can successfully access the environment variable.
    7. **Validate Dynatrace API Access (Optional but Recommended):** To further demonstrate the impact, the attacker can use the exposed API token to make a request to the Dynatrace API. For example, using `curl`:
       ```bash
       curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token <PASTE_EXPOSED_API_TOKEN_HERE>" "<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>/api/v2/settings/objects"
       ```
       Replace `<PASTE_EXPOSED_API_TOKEN_HERE>` with the token obtained in step 6, and `<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>` with the base URL of the Dynatrace tenant associated with the token. If the command successfully returns Dynatrace settings objects (or any other data based on token permissions), it confirms that the exposed token grants unauthorized access to the Dynatrace environment.
