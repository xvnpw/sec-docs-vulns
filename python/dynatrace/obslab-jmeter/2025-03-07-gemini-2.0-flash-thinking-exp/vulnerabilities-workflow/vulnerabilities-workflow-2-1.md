### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Dynatrace API Token Exposure in JMeter Script

- Description:
    1. The project provides a JMeter script (`example.jmx`) to demonstrate sending SDLC events to Dynatrace.
    2. The `environment_installer.py` script is designed to replace placeholders in `example.jmx` with user-provided Dynatrace environment details, including an API token (`DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER`).
    3. However, if a user directly downloads or forks the repository and runs the JMeter script without properly executing the `environment_installer.py` script or understanding the placeholder mechanism, the `example.jmx` file might still contain the `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER`.
    4. If the user then proceeds to manually edit `example.jmx` and incorrectly inserts a valid Dynatrace API token directly into the script instead of using environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism, they are hardcoding the API token.
    5. Subsequently, if this modified `example.jmx` file with the hardcoded API token is committed to a publicly accessible repository (e.g., GitHub), the Dynatrace API token becomes exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    6. An attacker who discovers this exposed API token can then use it to send arbitrary SDLC events or potentially perform other actions allowed by the token's permissions within the victim's Dynatrace environment.

- Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Data Injection/Manipulation:** An attacker can use the exposed Dynatrace API token to send malicious or misleading SDLC events to the victim's Dynatrace environment. This could pollute monitoring data, trigger false alerts, or disrupt Dynatrace-integrated workflows.
    - **Potential Broader Access (depending on token scope):** While the provided documentation suggests creating a token with limited permissions (`openpipeline.events_sdlc`, `ReadConfig`, `DataExport`, `CaptureRequestData`), if the user mistakenly uses a token with broader scopes (e.g., `FullAccess`), the attacker's impact could be significantly wider, potentially allowing configuration changes or data exfiltration from the Dynatrace environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Placeholder in `example.jmx`:** The `example.jmx` script uses `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` instead of a hardcoded token. This is intended to prevent accidental exposure if users use the script directly without configuration. This is implemented in `/code/jmeterscripts/example.jmx` (based on description, file not provided directly).
    - **`environment_installer.py` for Placeholder Replacement:** The `environment_installer.py` script automates the process of replacing the `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` with the actual `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable value. This is implemented in `/code/environment_installer.py`.
    - **Documentation Guidance on API Token Creation:** The `docs/getting-started.md` guides users to create an API token with specific, limited permissions, reducing the potential impact of token exposure.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Explicit Warning in README and Documentation:**  A prominent warning in the README.md and within the "Run Demo" documentation section should explicitly advise users *against* hardcoding API tokens directly into the `example.jmx` file. It should emphasize the importance of using environment variables or secure configuration practices.
    - **Input Validation/Sanitization in `environment_installer.py`:** While not directly related to hardcoding in `example.jmx`, the `environment_installer.py` could include basic validation to ensure that the provided `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable is at least present and potentially check for a minimum length or format (though format validation for API tokens can be complex). This can help prevent misconfiguration during setup.
    - **Git Hooks to Prevent Committing `example.jmx` with Placeholders:**  A pre-commit Git hook could be added to check if `example.jmx` still contains `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` before allowing a commit. This would act as a preventative measure against accidentally committing the file with the placeholder, although it wouldn't prevent users from hardcoding a real token and committing that.

- Preconditions:
    1. User downloads or forks the repository.
    2. User attempts to run the JMeter demo.
    3. User either:
        - Fails to run `environment_installer.py` correctly, leaving `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` in `example.jmx`, and then manually edits `example.jmx` to insert a real API token directly.
        - Or, misunderstands the placeholder concept and directly inserts a valid API token into `example.jmx` without using environment variables.
    4. User commits the modified `example.jmx` file with the hardcoded API token to a public repository (e.g., GitHub).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`jmeterscripts/example.jmx` (Placeholder):**  Assume this file initially contains the string `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` in the HTTP Header Manager within the "teardown thread group" request. This placeholder is intended to be replaced by the `environment_installer.py` script.
    2. **`environment_installer.py` (Placeholder Replacement):**
       - The script reads the `DT_API_TOKEN` environment variable: `DT_API_TOKEN = os.environ.get("DT_API_TOKEN")`.
       - It uses `do_file_replace` function to replace `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` with the value of `DT_API_TOKEN` in `example.jmx`:
         ```python
         do_file_replace(pattern=f"{BASE_DIR}/jmeterscripts/example.jmx", find_string="DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER", replace_string=DT_API_TOKEN)
         ```
       - This script correctly implements the placeholder replacement mechanism if executed as intended.
    3. **`docs/run-demo.md` and `docs/getting-started.md` (Instructions):**
       - These documentation files guide users on how to run the demo, including setting up the API token and running `environment_installer.py` implicitly by running the codespace.
       - However, they could be more explicit in warning against hardcoding API tokens in `example.jmx` directly and emphasize the intended workflow with environment variables and placeholder replacement.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Fork the repository.
        - Do *not* run the recommended setup steps (i.e., intentionally skip running `environment_installer.py` directly, simulating a user who might not follow instructions precisely or understand the setup).
        - Manually edit `/code/jmeterscripts/example.jmx`.
        - In the "Authorization" header of the "SDLC Event" HTTP Request within the "teardown thread group", replace `DT_API_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` with a *valid* Dynatrace API token (you can create a test token with `openpipeline.events_sdlc` permission for this test).
        - Commit this modified `example.jmx` file to your forked, public repository.
    2. **Verification (Simulate Attacker):**
        - Access the public repository where you committed the modified `example.jmx`.
        - View the commit history and examine the changes to `example.jmx`.
        - Confirm that the Dynatrace API token you inserted is now publicly visible in the repository's history.
    3. **Exploit (Simulate Attacker):**
        - Copy the exposed API token from the public repository.
        - Use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to send a crafted SDLC event to the Dynatrace API endpoint (`/platform/ingest/v1/events.sdlc`) using the exposed API token in the `Authorization` header.
        - Verify in the Dynatrace tenant associated with the API token that the crafted SDLC event is successfully ingested. This confirms unauthorized data injection.

This test case demonstrates that if a user hardcodes an API token into `example.jmx` and commits it publicly, the token becomes exposed and can be used by an attacker to inject data into the Dynatrace environment.
