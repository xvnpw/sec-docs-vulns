### Combined Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive API Token

- Description:
    1. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace configuration data if the API token used by the extension is configured with overly broad permissions.
    2. The Dynatrace ActiveGate extension requires an API token to authenticate with the Dynatrace API.
    3. If this token is granted permissions beyond the minimum required (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`), such as `ReadConfig` or `DataExport`, and if an attacker gains access to this token, they could leverage these excessive permissions.
    4. An attacker gaining access to the overly permissive token could perform unauthorized actions, including reading sensitive configuration data or even modifying configurations depending on the granted permissions.

- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace configuration data.
    - Depending on the overly granted permissions, the attacker might be able to read configurations, export data, or potentially even modify configurations if write permissions are mistakenly granted.
    - This could lead to exposure of sensitive business information, disruption of monitoring, or further malicious activities within the Dynatrace environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself.
    - The `README.md` provides guidance on the *minimum* required permissions, implicitly suggesting to avoid granting excessive permissions.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Principle of Least Privilege Enforcement in Documentation:** The extension documentation should explicitly and strongly recommend the principle of least privilege for API token creation. It should clearly state the *minimum* required permissions (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`) and warn against granting broader permissions.
    - **API Token Permission Validation (Enhancement):** As a future enhancement, the extension could include a check during initialization to verify that the API token has *only* the necessary permissions. If overly broad permissions are detected, the extension could log a warning or refuse to start, prompting the user to review and restrict the token permissions.

- Preconditions:
    - A Dynatrace environment with the "Log all audit-related system events" setting enabled.
    - An API token configured for the Dynatrace environment with *overly broad permissions* (beyond `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`).
    - The extension is configured to use this overly permissive API token.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`
    - Function: `initialize()`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      self.headers = {
          'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(),
      }
      ```
    - The `initialize` function in `AuditActiveGatePlugin.py` retrieves the API token from the plugin configuration (`config['apiToken']`) and sets it in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
    - The code directly uses the provided API token without any validation of its permissions.
    - If a user configures the extension with an API token that has permissions beyond the documented minimum requirements (e.g., including `ReadConfig`, `DataExport`, or even write permissions), the extension will inherit and utilize these excessive permissions for all its Dynatrace API interactions.
    - This means that if an attacker were to gain access to an ActiveGate where this extension is deployed or intercept the API token through other means, they could potentially exploit these overly broad permissions to perform actions beyond the intended scope of the extension.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension to a Dynatrace ActiveGate and upload it to the Dynatrace server.
        - Create a Dynatrace API token with permissions *exceeding* the minimum requirements. Include `ReadConfig` permission in addition to `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, and `events.ingest`.
        - Configure the extension in Dynatrace UI using this overly permissive API token.
    2. **Trigger:**
        - As an attacker (assuming access to the overly permissive API token), use a tool like `curl` or a programming language with an HTTP library to make a direct API request to Dynatrace using this token.
        - Target an API endpoint that requires the *excessive* permission (`ReadConfig` in this example), such as `/api/v2/settings/objects` to read Dynatrace configuration settings.
        - Example `curl` command:
          ```bash
          curl -X GET \
            'https://<your-dynatrace-tenant>/api/v2/settings/objects' \
            -H 'Authorization: Api-Token <overly-permissive-api-token>'
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine the response from the API request.
        - If the request is successful (HTTP status code `200 OK`) and returns Dynatrace configuration data in the response body, this confirms the vulnerability.
        - Successful retrieval of configuration data using the overly permissive token demonstrates that the token grants access beyond the intended scope of the extension, validating the "Overly Permissive API Token" vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: API Token Exposure in ActiveGate Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server where the Dynatrace Automated Configuration Audit extension is installed. This could be achieved through various means such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the ActiveGate server itself, using stolen credentials, or social engineering.
    2. Once the attacker has access to the ActiveGate server's file system, they can navigate to the extension's deployment directory. According to the `README.md` file, the extension is deployed in the following locations:
        - Linux: `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment`
        - Windows: `C:\Program Files\dynatrace\remotepluginmodule\plugin_deployment`
    3. Within the plugin deployment directory, the attacker can locate the configuration file for the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension. The exact filename and format of the configuration file are not explicitly defined in the provided files, but it's typically a text-based configuration file (e.g., `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.conf`) that is part of the extension package.
    4. The attacker opens the configuration file and searches for the `apiToken` parameter, which is used to authenticate with the Dynatrace API.
    5. The API token is stored in plaintext within the configuration file. The attacker copies the plaintext API token.
    6. The attacker can now use this stolen API token to make unauthorized requests to the Dynatrace API. They can access sensitive audit logs and entity data within the Dynatrace environment, as the token has `auditLogs.read` and `entities.read` permissions (as stated in `README.md`).

- Impact:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can access sensitive Dynatrace audit logs, which may contain details about configuration changes, user activities, and potentially sensitive data related to monitored entities.
    - **Unauthorized Data Access:** The attacker can access Dynatrace entity data, gaining insights into the monitored infrastructure, applications, and services.
    - **Further Malicious Activities:** With access to audit logs and entity data, the attacker can gain a deeper understanding of the Dynatrace environment and potentially plan further attacks or misuse the information for malicious purposes.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The security of the API token relies entirely on the security of the ActiveGate server and the assumption that access to the ActiveGate server is restricted to authorized personnel.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Encrypted Storage of API Token:** The API token should be stored in an encrypted format within the ActiveGate extension's configuration. This would prevent attackers from easily retrieving the token even if they gain access to the configuration file.
    - **Secure Secret Management:** Implement a secure secret management mechanism on the ActiveGate to store and retrieve the API token. This could involve using dedicated secret storage solutions or leveraging ActiveGate's built-in security features if available.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly code mitigation, regularly review and minimize the permissions granted to the API token. Grant only the necessary permissions (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest` as per `README.md`) and avoid granting broader access than required.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must gain unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server where the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension is installed.
    - The extension must be installed and configured with a valid Dynatrace API token.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`:**
    ```python
    class AuditPluginRemote(RemoteBasePlugin):
        # ...
        def initialize(self, **kwargs):
            # ...
            config = kwargs['config']
            self.url = config['url'].strip()
            # ...
            self.headers = {
                'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(), # API token is read from config
            }
            # ...
    ```
    - The `initialize` method in `AuditActiveGatePlugin.py` reads the `apiToken` directly from the `config` dictionary provided by the ActiveGate plugin framework.
    - The `apiToken` is then stored in the `self.headers` dictionary as a plain text string: `'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip()`.
    - This `self.headers` is passed to the `RequestHandler` class.

    2. **File: `/code/RequestHandler.py`:**
    ```python
    class RequestHandler():
        def __init__(self, base_url, headers, verify_ssl=True):
            self.url = base_url
            self.headers = headers # Headers including API token are stored in RequestHandler
            self.verify_ssl = verify_ssl

        def make_dt_api_request(
                self,
                http_method,
                endpoint,
                json_payload=None,
                params=None
        ) -> requests.Response:
            while True:
                response = requests.request(
                        http_method,
                        f"{self.url}{endpoint}",
                        json=json_payload,
                        headers=self.headers, # Headers including API token are used for requests
                        verify=self.verify_ssl,
                        params=params
                )
                # ...
                return response
    ```
    - The `RequestHandler` class stores the `headers` (containing the API token) in `self.headers`.
    - The `make_dt_api_request` method uses `self.headers` to make HTTP requests to the Dynatrace API.
    - The API token, once read from the configuration, is used in plaintext for all subsequent API requests made by the extension.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Configuration File (ActiveGate Server) -->  AuditActiveGatePlugin.py (initialize) -->  RequestHandler.py (__init__) --> API Requests (make_dt_api_request) --> Dynatrace API (Authentication via API Token in Headers)
                      (Plaintext API Token)         (Plaintext API Token in self.headers)   (Plaintext API Token in self.headers)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension to an ActiveGate and configure it with a valid Dynatrace API token. Ensure "Log all audit-related system events" is enabled and the API token has the required `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, and `events.ingest` permissions as per `README.md`.
    2. **Gain Access to ActiveGate Server:** Simulate an attacker gaining access to the ActiveGate server's file system. This step is environment-dependent and might involve using SSH if enabled, or simulating local access if testing in a local environment.
    3. **Locate Extension Configuration:** Navigate to the plugin deployment directory on the ActiveGate server:
        - Linux: `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment`
        - Windows: `C:\Program Files\dynatrace\remotepluginmodule\plugin_deployment`
        Inside this directory, find the directory corresponding to the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension. The exact directory name will depend on the extension's packaging.
    4. **Find and Open Configuration File:** Within the extension's directory, locate and open the configuration file. The filename and format are not specified, but it's likely to be a file with a common configuration extension (e.g., `.ini`, `.conf`, `.yaml`). Look for files that seem to contain configuration parameters like `url`, `apiToken`, `pollingInterval`, etc.
    5. **Extract API Token:** Open the configuration file and search for the line or parameter that defines the `apiToken`. The token value should be visible in plaintext. Copy this token value.
    6. **Verify Unauthorized API Access:** Use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to make a request to the Dynatrace API using the stolen API token. For example, to retrieve audit logs, use the following `curl` command, replacing `<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>` with your Dynatrace tenant URL and `<STOLEN_API_TOKEN>` with the copied API token:

       ```bash
       curl -X GET \
         '<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>/api/v2/auditlogs?filter=category("CONFIG")' \
         -H 'Authorization: Api-Token <STOLEN_API_TOKEN>'
       ```

    7. **Expected Result:** If the API token is valid and the attacker successfully extracted it, the Dynatrace API should respond with a JSON payload containing audit log data. This confirms that the attacker can use the stolen API token to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information within the Dynatrace environment. If the API call is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: API Token Exposure in Debug Logs

- Description:
    1. The Dynatrace ActiveGate extension is configured with an API token for authentication.
    2. The `RequestHandler.py` uses the `requests` library to make API calls to the Dynatrace API.
    3. In the `make_dt_api_request` function, the code logs the entire `response.request` object at the DEBUG level: `logger.debug("[RequestHandler] Requests: %s", response.request)`.
    4. The `response.request` object from the `requests` library can contain sensitive information, including request headers.
    5. If debug logging is enabled for the extension (which might be done for troubleshooting), the logs could inadvertently contain the API token in plain text, exposing it to anyone with access to the ActiveGate logs.

- Impact:
    - Exposure of the Dynatrace API token.
    - An attacker with access to the ActiveGate logs can extract the API token.
    - With the API token, the attacker gains unauthorized read access to Dynatrace audit logs and entity data (auditLogs.read, entities.read).
    - This can lead to information disclosure of sensitive configuration changes and entity details within the Dynatrace environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself to prevent logging the request object in debug mode.
    - Implicit reliance on users securing their ActiveGate logs.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Avoid logging the entire `response.request` object at DEBUG level. Instead, log only relevant parts of the request, excluding headers or specifically masking sensitive headers like 'Authorization'.
    - Recommend secure logging practices in documentation, emphasizing not to enable debug logging in production or to secure access to ActiveGate logs.

- Preconditions:
    - Debug logging must be enabled for the Dynatrace ActiveGate extension.
    - An attacker must have access to the ActiveGate logs where debug messages are written.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - 1. Open `/code/RequestHandler.py`.
    - 2. Locate the `make_dt_api_request` function.
    - 3. Find the line: `logger.debug("[RequestHandler] Requests: %s", response.request)`.
    - 4. This line uses the `logging` library to log the `response.request` object at the DEBUG level.
    - 5. The `response.request` object from the `requests` library includes details of the request made, including headers.
    - 6. The headers, as defined in `AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`, contain the API token in the 'Authorization' header.
    - 7. If debug logging is enabled, this line will cause the API token to be written to the logs in plain text as part of the request headers.

- Security Test Case:
    - 1. Deploy the Dynatrace Automated Configuration Audit extension to an ActiveGate.
    - 2. Configure the extension in Dynatrace UI with a valid Dynatrace URL and API token.
    - 3. Enable DEBUG logging for the extension. This may involve modifying the ActiveGate's logging configuration or the extension's logging settings if configurable.
    - 4. Trigger the extension to run a polling cycle by waiting for the configured polling interval or manually triggering the `query` function if possible through ActiveGate testing tools or by restarting the extension.
    - 5. Access the ActiveGate extension logs. The location of these logs depends on the ActiveGate installation (e.g., `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/log/extension/<extension_name>.log` on Linux).
    - 6. Search the logs for entries containing the string: `[RequestHandler] Requests:`.
    - 7. Examine the log entries found. Check if the `response.request` object, which is printed after this string, contains the 'Authorization' header.
    - 8. Verify if the 'Authorization' header within the logged `response.request` object contains the API token in plain text.
    - 9. If the API token is found in plain text within the debug logs, the vulnerability is confirmed.
