### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: API Token Exposure in ActiveGate Configuration
- Description: The Dynatrace API token, which grants the extension permissions to read audit logs, entity data, and ingest events, is stored as a plain text configuration parameter within the ActiveGate's configuration. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server or its configuration files can retrieve this API token. This could occur through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the ActiveGate itself, gaining access to the underlying operating system, or through insider threats. Once the API token is obtained, the attacker can impersonate the extension and perform actions within the Dynatrace environment, depending on the token's permissions.
- Impact:
    1. **Data Breach (Audit Logs and Entity Data):** An attacker can use the compromised API token to access and exfiltrate sensitive audit logs, potentially revealing configuration details, user activity, and security-relevant information about the Dynatrace environment and monitored entities. They can also read entity data, gaining insights into the monitored infrastructure, applications, and services.
    2. **Malicious Event Injection:** With `events.ingest` permission, the attacker can inject false or misleading events into Dynatrace. This could be used to disrupt monitoring, hide malicious activities, or create false alarms, leading to operational disruptions and potentially masking real security incidents.
    3. **Reputation Damage:** If a security breach occurs due to a compromised API token from this extension, it can damage the reputation of the project and the organizations using it.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The security of the API token relies entirely on the security of the ActiveGate infrastructure and configuration management practices.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Storage of API Token:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for the API token instead of plain text configuration. Consider leveraging Dynatrace's secrets management capabilities if available within the ActiveGate environment. Alternatively, explore using environment variables or dedicated secret storage solutions that the ActiveGate can securely access.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The documentation currently requests `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read` and `events.ingest` permissions. While seemingly necessary, a thorough review should be conducted to confirm if all these permissions are absolutely required. If possible, restrict the API token permissions to the minimum set necessary for the extension's functionality. For example, if event ingestion is not crucial for core audit reporting, consider removing `events.ingest` permission to reduce the potential impact of a token compromise.
    - **Documentation Enhancement:**  Improve documentation to explicitly warn users about the security risks of storing API tokens in plain text configuration files and strongly recommend securing access to the ActiveGate server and its configuration. Include best practices for ActiveGate security and emphasize the importance of regularly rotating API tokens.
- Preconditions:
    1. The ActiveGate extension is installed and configured with a Dynatrace API token.
    2. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server's file system or management interface where the extension's configuration is stored.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`
    2. Function: `initialize(self, **kwargs)`
    3. Line: `self.headers = { 'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(), }`
    4. The code directly reads the `apiToken` from the `config` dictionary, which is populated from the ActiveGate's plugin configuration.
    5. The `apiToken` is then stored in the `self.headers` dictionary and used in subsequent API requests made by the `RequestHandler` class.
    6. The API token is handled in memory during the plugin's execution but originates from and persists within the ActiveGate configuration file in plain text.
    ```python
    def initialize(self, **kwargs):
        """Initialize the plugin with variables provided by user in the UI
        """
        logger.info("Config: %s", self.config)
        config = kwargs['config']

        self.url = config['url'].strip()
        if self.url[-1] == '/':
            self.url = self.url[:-1]

        self.headers = {
            'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(), # API token is read from config
        }

        self.pollingInterval = int(config['pollingInterval']) * 60 * 1000
        ...
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        -  Install the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension on a Dynatrace ActiveGate in a test environment.
        -  Configure the extension with a valid Dynatrace API token that has `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, and `events.ingest` permissions.
        -  Gain shell access to the ActiveGate server as an attacker would (e.g., through SSH if credentials were compromised or via a local exploit).
    2. **Locate Configuration File:**
        -  Identify the directory where ActiveGate extensions are deployed. Based on the `README.md`, this is typically:
            -  Linux: `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment`
            -  Windows: `C:\Program Files\dynatrace\remotepluginmodule\plugin_deployment`
        -  Navigate to the directory corresponding to the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension (the exact directory name will depend on the extension's packaging).
        -  Locate the configuration file for the extension. This might be named `config.ini`, `plugin.json`, or similar, depending on the ActiveGate plugin framework and how the extension is packaged.
    3. **Extract API Token:**
        -  Open the configuration file using a text editor (e.g., `cat`, `notepad`).
        -  Search for the `apiToken` parameter within the configuration file.
        -  Copy the value of the `apiToken`. It should be visible in plain text.
    4. **Verify API Access (using `curl` as an example):**
        -  Use `curl` or a similar HTTP client from your attacker machine (or the compromised ActiveGate itself) to make a request to the Dynatrace API, using the extracted API token.
        -  Example command to retrieve audit logs:
           ```bash
           curl -X GET \
             'https://<your-dynatrace-tenant-url>/api/v2/auditlogs?filter=category("CONFIG")&sort=timestamp&from=$(date +%s)000-3600000' \
             -H 'Authorization: Api-Token <extracted_api_token>'
           ```
           Replace `<your-dynatrace-tenant-url>` with the Dynatrace tenant URL and `<extracted_api_token>` with the token you extracted.
        -  If the command successfully returns audit log data (HTTP status code 200 and JSON response), it confirms that the API token has been successfully compromised and can be used to access Dynatrace API endpoints.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker with access to the ActiveGate's configuration can retrieve the API token, confirming the API Token Exposure vulnerability.
