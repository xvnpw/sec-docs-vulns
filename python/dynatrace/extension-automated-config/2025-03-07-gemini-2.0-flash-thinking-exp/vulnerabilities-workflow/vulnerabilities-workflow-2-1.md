### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Overly Permissive API Token
- Description:
    - An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace configuration data if the API token used by the extension is configured with overly broad permissions.
    - The Dynatrace ActiveGate extension requires an API token to authenticate with the Dynatrace API.
    - If this token is granted permissions beyond the minimum required (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`), such as `ReadConfig` or `DataExport`, and if an attacker gains access to this token, they could leverage these excessive permissions.
    - An attacker gaining access to the overly permissive token could perform unauthorized actions, including reading sensitive configuration data or even modifying configurations depending on the granted permissions.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace configuration data.
    - Depending on the overly granted permissions, the attacker might be able to read configurations, export data, or potentially even modify configurations if write permissions are mistakenly granted.
    - This could lead to exposure of sensitive business information, disruption of monitoring, or further malicious activities within the Dynatrace environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself.
    - The `README.md` provides guidance on the *minimum* required permissions, implicitly suggesting to avoid granting excessive permissions.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Principle of Least Privilege Enforcement in Documentation:** The extension documentation should explicitly and strongly recommend the principle of least privilege for API token creation. It should clearly state the *minimum* required permissions (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`) and warn against granting broader permissions.
    - **API Token Permission Validation (Enhancement):** As a future enhancement, the extension could include a check during initialization to verify that the API token has *only* the necessary permissions. If overly broad permissions are detected, the extension could log a warning or refuse to start, prompting the user to review and restrict the token permissions.
- Preconditions:
    - A Dynatrace environment with the "Log all audit-related system events" setting enabled.
    - An API token configured for the Dynatrace environment with *overly broad permissions* (beyond `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest`).
    - The extension is configured to use this overly permissive API token.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`
    - Function: `initialize()`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```python
      self.headers = {
          'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(),
      }
      ```
    - The `initialize` function in `AuditActiveGatePlugin.py` retrieves the API token from the plugin configuration (`config['apiToken']`) and sets it in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
    - The code directly uses the provided API token without any validation of its permissions.
    - If a user configures the extension with an API token that has permissions beyond the documented minimum requirements (e.g., including `ReadConfig`, `DataExport`, or even write permissions), the extension will inherit and utilize these excessive permissions for all its Dynatrace API interactions.
    - This means that if an attacker were to gain access to an ActiveGate where this extension is deployed or intercept the API token through other means, they could potentially exploit these overly broad permissions to perform actions beyond the intended scope of the extension.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension to a Dynatrace ActiveGate and upload it to the Dynatrace server.
        - Create a Dynatrace API token with permissions *exceeding* the minimum requirements. Include `ReadConfig` permission in addition to `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, and `events.ingest`.
        - Configure the extension in Dynatrace UI using this overly permissive API token.
    2. **Trigger:**
        - As an attacker (assuming access to the overly permissive API token), use a tool like `curl` or a programming language with an HTTP library to make a direct API request to Dynatrace using this token.
        - Target an API endpoint that requires the *excessive* permission (`ReadConfig` in this example), such as `/api/v2/settings/objects` to read Dynatrace configuration settings.
        - Example `curl` command:
          ```bash
          curl -X GET \
            'https://<your-dynatrace-tenant>/api/v2/settings/objects' \
            -H 'Authorization: Api-Token <overly-permissive-api-token>'
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine the response from the API request.
        - If the request is successful (HTTP status code `200 OK`) and returns Dynatrace configuration data in the response body, this confirms the vulnerability.
        - Successful retrieval of configuration data using the overly permissive token demonstrates that the token grants access beyond the intended scope of the extension, validating the "Overly Permissive API Token" vulnerability.
