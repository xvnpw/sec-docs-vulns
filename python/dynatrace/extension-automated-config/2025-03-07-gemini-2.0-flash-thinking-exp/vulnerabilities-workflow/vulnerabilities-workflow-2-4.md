### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Dynatrace API Token Exposure on ActiveGate

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server where the Dynatrace Automated Configuration Audit extension is installed. This could be achieved through various means such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the ActiveGate server itself, using stolen credentials, or social engineering.
    2. Once the attacker has access to the ActiveGate server's file system, they can navigate to the extension's deployment directory. According to the `README.md` file, the extension is deployed in the following locations:
        - Linux: `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment`
        - Windows: `C:\Program Files\dynatrace\remotepluginmodule\plugin_deployment`
    3. Within the plugin deployment directory, the attacker can locate the configuration file for the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension. The exact filename and format of the configuration file are not explicitly defined in the provided files, but it's typically a text-based configuration file (e.g., `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.conf`) that is part of the extension package.
    4. The attacker opens the configuration file and searches for the `apiToken` parameter, which is used to authenticate with the Dynatrace API.
    5. The API token is stored in plaintext within the configuration file. The attacker copies the plaintext API token.
    6. The attacker can now use this stolen API token to make unauthorized requests to the Dynatrace API. They can access sensitive audit logs and entity data within the Dynatrace environment, as the token has `auditLogs.read` and `entities.read` permissions (as stated in `README.md`).

- Impact:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can access sensitive Dynatrace audit logs, which may contain details about configuration changes, user activities, and potentially sensitive data related to monitored entities.
    - **Unauthorized Data Access:** The attacker can access Dynatrace entity data, gaining insights into the monitored infrastructure, applications, and services.
    - **Further Malicious Activities:** With access to audit logs and entity data, the attacker can gain a deeper understanding of the Dynatrace environment and potentially plan further attacks or misuse the information for malicious purposes.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The security of the API token relies entirely on the security of the ActiveGate server and the assumption that access to the ActiveGate server is restricted to authorized personnel.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Encrypted Storage of API Token:** The API token should be stored in an encrypted format within the ActiveGate extension's configuration. This would prevent attackers from easily retrieving the token even if they gain access to the configuration file.
    - **Secure Secret Management:** Implement a secure secret management mechanism on the ActiveGate to store and retrieve the API token. This could involve using dedicated secret storage solutions or leveraging ActiveGate's built-in security features if available.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly code mitigation, regularly review and minimize the permissions granted to the API token. Grant only the necessary permissions (`auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, `events.ingest` as per `README.md`) and avoid granting broader access than required.
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Although not directly related to token exposure, ensure proper input sanitization and validation for all configuration parameters to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities that could lead to server compromise and token exposure.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker must gain unauthorized access to the ActiveGate server where the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension is installed.
    - The extension must be installed and configured with a valid Dynatrace API token.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/AuditActiveGatePlugin.py`:**
    ```python
    class AuditPluginRemote(RemoteBasePlugin):
        # ...
        def initialize(self, **kwargs):
            # ...
            config = kwargs['config']
            self.url = config['url'].strip()
            # ...
            self.headers = {
                'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip(), # API token is read from config
            }
            # ...
    ```
    - The `initialize` method in `AuditActiveGatePlugin.py` reads the `apiToken` directly from the `config` dictionary provided by the ActiveGate plugin framework.
    - The `apiToken` is then stored in the `self.headers` dictionary as a plain text string: `'Authorization': 'Api-Token ' + config['apiToken'].strip()`.
    - This `self.headers` is passed to the `RequestHandler` class.

    2. **File: `/code/RequestHandler.py`:**
    ```python
    class RequestHandler():
        def __init__(self, base_url, headers, verify_ssl=True):
            self.url = base_url
            self.headers = headers # Headers including API token are stored in RequestHandler
            self.verify_ssl = verify_ssl

        def make_dt_api_request(
                self,
                http_method,
                endpoint,
                json_payload=None,
                params=None
        ) -> requests.Response:
            while True:
                response = requests.request(
                        http_method,
                        f"{self.url}{endpoint}",
                        json=json_payload,
                        headers=self.headers, # Headers including API token are used for requests
                        verify=self.verify_ssl,
                        params=params
                )
                # ...
                return response
    ```
    - The `RequestHandler` class stores the `headers` (containing the API token) in `self.headers`.
    - The `make_dt_api_request` method uses `self.headers` to make HTTP requests to the Dynatrace API.
    - The API token, once read from the configuration, is used in plaintext for all subsequent API requests made by the extension.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Configuration File (ActiveGate Server) -->  AuditActiveGatePlugin.py (initialize) -->  RequestHandler.py (__init__) --> API Requests (make_dt_api_request) --> Dynatrace API (Authentication via API Token in Headers)
                      (Plaintext API Token)         (Plaintext API Token in self.headers)   (Plaintext API Token in self.headers)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension to an ActiveGate and configure it with a valid Dynatrace API token. Ensure "Log all audit-related system events" is enabled and the API token has the required `auditLogs.read`, `entities.read`, and `events.ingest` permissions as per `README.md`.
    2. **Gain Access to ActiveGate Server:** Simulate an attacker gaining access to the ActiveGate server's file system. This step is environment-dependent and might involve using SSH if enabled, or simulating local access if testing in a local environment.
    3. **Locate Extension Configuration:** Navigate to the plugin deployment directory on the ActiveGate server:
        - Linux: `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment`
        - Windows: `C:\Program Files\dynatrace\remotepluginmodule\plugin_deployment`
        Inside this directory, find the directory corresponding to the `dt-automated-config-audit` extension. The exact directory name will depend on the extension's packaging.
    4. **Find and Open Configuration File:** Within the extension's directory, locate and open the configuration file. The filename and format are not specified, but it's likely to be a file with a common configuration extension (e.g., `.ini`, `.conf`, `.yaml`). Look for files that seem to contain configuration parameters like `url`, `apiToken`, `pollingInterval`, etc.
    5. **Extract API Token:** Open the configuration file and search for the line or parameter that defines the `apiToken`. The token value should be visible in plaintext. Copy this token value.
    6. **Verify Unauthorized API Access:** Use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to make a request to the Dynatrace API using the stolen API token. For example, to retrieve audit logs, use the following `curl` command, replacing `<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>` with your Dynatrace tenant URL and `<STOLEN_API_TOKEN>` with the copied API token:

       ```bash
       curl -X GET \
         '<YOUR_DYNATRACE_TENANT_URL>/api/v2/auditlogs?filter=category("CONFIG")' \
         -H 'Authorization: Api-Token <STOLEN_API_TOKEN>'
       ```

    7. **Expected Result:** If the API token is valid and the attacker successfully extracted it, the Dynatrace API should respond with a JSON payload containing audit log data. This confirms that the attacker can use the stolen API token to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information within the Dynatrace environment. If the API call is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.
