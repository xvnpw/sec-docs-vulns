### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Exposure of Dynatrace PaaS Token in Ansible Logs
- Description:
    1. The Ansible role retrieves the Dynatrace PaaS token from the `oneagent_paas_token` variable.
    2. This token is used to authenticate against the Dynatrace Deployment API to download the OneAgent installer.
    3. While the `no_log: true` attribute is used in tasks that directly use the token for downloading installers (`/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-windows.yml`, `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-unix.yml`), there's a risk that the `oneagent_paas_token` variable might be exposed in other Ansible logs or outputs if `no_log: true` is not consistently applied across all tasks that handle or reference this variable, or due to misconfiguration in Ansible logging settings.
    4. If standard Ansible logging is enabled without careful consideration, and if tasks indirectly or accidentally output the `oneagent_paas_token` variable value (e.g., through debugging tasks, error messages that include variable values, or if `no_log: true` is missed in a relevant task), the token could be written to log files on the Ansible control node or even displayed in the Ansible output on the terminal, depending on the Ansible logging verbosity and configuration.
    5. An attacker gaining access to these logs or terminal output could then extract the PaaS token.
- Impact:
    - High: Unauthorized access to the Dynatrace environment. With the PaaS token, an attacker could potentially:
        - Access sensitive monitoring data within the Dynatrace environment.
        - Deploy malicious OneAgents to monitored systems, potentially leading to further compromise.
        - Modify Dynatrace configurations, disrupting monitoring or causing further security issues.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `no_log: true` is used in the tasks that directly use the `oneagent_paas_token` to download the installer (`/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-windows.yml`, `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-unix.yml`). This prevents the token from being directly printed in the Ansible task output for these specific download steps.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Consistent `no_log: true` application:** Ensure that `no_log: true` is applied to *all* tasks that handle or reference the `oneagent_paas_token` variable, not just the download tasks. This includes any debugging tasks, error handling tasks, or any custom tasks that might inadvertently output variable values.
    - **Documentation on Secure Logging Practices:** Add documentation to the role's README advising users on secure Ansible logging practices when using this role. This should include recommendations to:
        - Configure Ansible logging to be minimal and avoid verbose output in production environments.
        - Securely store and manage Ansible logs, restricting access to authorized personnel only.
        - Regularly review Ansible logging configurations and practices to ensure ongoing security.
        - Consider using Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive variables like `oneagent_paas_token` at rest, although this does not prevent runtime exposure if logging is misconfigured.
- Preconditions:
    - Ansible logging must be enabled in a way that captures task outputs or variable values.
    - An attacker needs to gain access to the Ansible logs or the terminal output where Ansible commands are executed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Variable Definition:** The `oneagent_paas_token` variable is defined in `/code/roles/oneagent/defaults/main.yml`.
    ```yaml
    oneagent_paas_token: ""
    ```
    2. **Token Usage in Download Tasks:** The `oneagent_paas_token` is used in the download tasks within `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download.yml`, specifically included by `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-unix.yml` and `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-windows.yml`.
    - Example from `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/download-unix.yml`:
    ```yaml
    - name: Download OneAgent installer
      ansible.builtin.get_url:
        url: "{{ _oneagent_installer_url }}"
        dest: "{{ oneagent_installer_path }}"
        validate_certs: "{{ oneagent_validate_certs | default(true) }}"
        mode: "0755"
        headers:
          Authorization: Api-Token {{ oneagent_paas_token }}
      environment:
        SSL_CERT_FILE: "{{ oneagent_installer_download_cert | default(omit) }}"
      no_log: true # Mitigation: no_log is set here
      ignore_errors: true
      register: _oneagent_download_result
    ```
    - The `no_log: true` attribute is correctly used in these download tasks to prevent the `Authorization` header, which includes the token, from being logged directly by Ansible for this step.
    3. **Potential Logging Misconfigurations:** While direct logging in download tasks is mitigated, the risk remains if:
        - `no_log: true` is not applied to other tasks that might reference or process `oneagent_paas_token` (though no such tasks are immediately apparent in the provided code, future modifications could introduce this).
        - Ansible's global logging configuration is set to a very high verbosity level (e.g., `-vvvv`) which might override `no_log: true` in certain scenarios or capture variable values in other contexts.
        - Custom logging handlers are configured in Ansible that might not respect `no_log: true`.
        - Error messages generated by other tasks might inadvertently include the token if variable substitution occurs in error outputs and `no_log: true` is not universally applied.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Configure an Ansible control node and a target host.
        - Set up the Ansible collection as described in the README.
        - Configure the Ansible playbook to use the `dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent` role for installation.
        - Set `oneagent_environment_url` and `oneagent_paas_token` variables in the playbook or inventory with valid, but *test* Dynatrace environment credentials.
        - **Crucially, enable Ansible logging to a file.** This can be done by setting the `ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configuring `log_path` in the Ansible configuration file (`ansible.cfg`). Set a reasonably verbose logging level (e.g., `-v` or `-vv`) to capture task output without going to extreme debug levels.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Run the Ansible playbook against the target host.
    3. **Verification:**
        - **Examine the Ansible log file.** Search the log file for the value of the `oneagent_paas_token`.
        - **Check Terminal Output (if applicable):** If Ansible output to the terminal is also enabled and captured, examine it for the PaaS token value.
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerability Present):** If the `oneagent_paas_token` value is found in the Ansible log file (outside of highly specific debug output which is less likely in normal operation, but even its presence would be a concern), or in the terminal output (depending on verbosity and misconfiguration), then the vulnerability is present. This indicates that despite `no_log: true` in download tasks, the token could still be exposed through general Ansible logging mechanisms if not carefully configured and managed.
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerability Mitigated):** If the `oneagent_paas_token` value is *not* found in the Ansible logs (under reasonable verbosity levels and standard configurations, and excluding highly verbose debug logs unless those are unintentionally enabled in production), and not in the terminal output (again, under standard configurations), then the implemented `no_log: true` in download tasks is effectively preventing *direct* logging of the token in those specific tasks. However, the missing mitigations regarding consistent `no_log` and documentation should still be noted as areas for improvement to enhance overall security posture against accidental token exposure in broader Ansible operations.

This test case aims to demonstrate the *potential* for token exposure through Ansible logging, even with `no_log: true` applied in specific tasks, highlighting the need for comprehensive secure logging practices and consistent `no_log` usage across all sensitive variable handling within the Ansible role.
