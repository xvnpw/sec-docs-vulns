* Vulnerability Name: Unauthorized Dynatrace OneAgent Deployment
  * Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to an Ansible control machine where the Dynatrace OneAgent Ansible collection is installed and configured.
    2. The attacker modifies existing Ansible playbooks or creates new playbooks that utilize the `dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent` role.
    3. The attacker sets the target hosts in the Ansible inventory to systems they do not have legitimate access to or management rights over.
    4. The attacker executes the modified or newly created Ansible playbook.
    5. The Ansible playbook uses the `dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent` role to deploy Dynatrace OneAgent onto the attacker-specified target systems.
    6. Dynatrace OneAgent is successfully installed and starts monitoring the unauthorized systems, sending data back to the attacker's Dynatrace environment (if the attacker also controls the `oneagent_environment_url` and `oneagent_paas_token` parameters).
  * Impact:
    - Unauthorized monitoring of systems.
    - Potential exfiltration of sensitive system data to the attacker's Dynatrace environment.
    - Violation of data privacy and compliance regulations.
    - Resource consumption on target systems due to the running OneAgent.
  * Vulnerability Rank: High
  * Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project itself relies on the user to secure their Ansible control machine and manage access to it.
    - The documentation encourages secure handling of credentials like PaaS tokens.
  * Missing Mitigations:
    - Implementation of access control mechanisms within the Ansible collection itself to restrict who can use it (this is generally outside the scope of an Ansible collection and is handled at the Ansible control machine level).
    - Built-in auditing or logging of deployments initiated by the collection (Ansible itself provides logging, but not specific to this collection's actions).
    - Mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of target systems before deployment.
  * Preconditions:
    - Attacker gains unauthorized access to an Ansible control machine with the Dynatrace OneAgent Ansible collection installed.
    - Attacker has sufficient privileges on the Ansible control machine to modify or execute Ansible playbooks.
    - Attacker has knowledge of Ansible and this specific collection.
  * Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Entry Point:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing an Ansible playbook that includes the `dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent` role.
    2. **Role Execution:** The `roles/oneagent/tasks/main.yml` file orchestrates the OneAgent deployment based on variables.
    3. **Parameter Handling:** The `roles/oneagent/tasks/params/params.yml` and related files validate parameters like `oneagent_environment_url`, `oneagent_paas_token`, and `oneagent_local_installer`. However, these checks are for valid input format and existence, not for authorization or legitimate use.
    4. **Installer Provisioning:** `roles/oneagent/tasks/provide-installer/provide-installer.yml` handles downloading or transferring the OneAgent installer.  The download process uses the provided `oneagent_environment_url` and `oneagent_paas_token`.
    5. **Installation and Configuration:** `roles/oneagent/tasks/install/install.yml` and `roles/oneagent/tasks/config/config.yml` perform the actual installation and configuration of OneAgent using the downloaded installer and provided parameters.
    6. **Lack of Authorization:** There are no checks within the Ansible role to verify if the target systems are authorized for monitoring by the Dynatrace environment associated with `oneagent_environment_url` and `oneagent_paas_token`. The role simply executes the deployment commands based on the provided configuration.
  * Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up an Ansible control machine with Ansible >= 2.15.0 and pywinrm (if targeting Windows).
        - Install the `dynatrace.oneagent` Ansible collection using `ansible-galaxy collection install dynatrace.oneagent`.
        - Configure a basic Ansible inventory file with a target host that you *do not* have authorization to monitor with Dynatrace.
        - Create a playbook that uses the `dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent` role. In this playbook:
            - Set `hosts` to the unauthorized target host from your inventory.
            - Provide valid `oneagent_environment_url` and `oneagent_paas_token` for a Dynatrace environment that you *do* control (or an attacker controls).
            - Do not use `oneagent_local_installer` to trigger direct download from Dynatrace.
    2. **Execution:**
        - As an attacker with access to the Ansible control machine, execute the playbook using `ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> <playbook_file>`.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Log in to the Dynatrace environment specified in `oneagent_environment_url`.
        - Check if the unauthorized target host is now listed as a monitored host in Dynatrace.
        - Verify that monitoring data (metrics, logs, etc.) is being received from the unauthorized target host in the Dynatrace environment.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The Dynatrace OneAgent should be successfully deployed to the unauthorized target host.
        - The unauthorized target host should appear in the Dynatrace environment and monitoring data should be visible, demonstrating successful unauthorized deployment and monitoring.
