### Vulnerability Name
Malicious Custom Configuration File Injection leading to Weakened Security Rules

### Description
A user can be tricked into using a maliciously crafted custom configuration file when running `LogAgentSecurityRuleChecker.py` with the `-c` or `-g` options. This malicious file can define overly permissive security rules (e.g., using broad directory or file patterns with "INCLUDE" action). When these weakened rules are deployed to the Dynatrace Log Agent, they can override the default security configurations and inadvertently allow the ingestion of sensitive log files that should have been excluded, potentially exposing sensitive data. The attacker needs to socially engineer a user to use their malicious configuration file with the tool.

### Impact
Exposure of sensitive data. If a user is tricked into using a malicious configuration, and deploys the generated or checked configuration to Dynatrace Log Agent, sensitive logs that should have been excluded by default might be ingested and become accessible.

### Vulnerability Rank
Medium

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
None. The tool processes custom configuration files without any validation of the security rules they contain.

### Missing Mitigations
- Input validation and sanitization for custom configuration files to prevent overly permissive rules.
- Security warnings to users about the risks of using custom configurations and especially generated configurations without careful review.
- Guidance and examples on how to create secure custom configuration files.

### Preconditions
- An attacker must socially engineer a user into using a malicious custom configuration file with `LogAgentSecurityRuleChecker.py`.
- The user must then deploy the resulting (potentially weakened) configuration to their Dynatrace Log Agent.

### Source Code Analysis
1. The script uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments, including `-c` (`--config_filenames`) and `-g` (`--generate_include_config`) which handle custom configuration files.
2. The `config_filepath_sort` function sorts configuration files by name, but does not validate their content.
3. The script reads the JSON configuration file using `json.loads()` and iterates through the `"allowed-log-paths-configuration"` section.
4. For each rule in the configuration, it extracts "directory-pattern", "file-pattern", and "action" and appends them to the `rules` list using `append_rule` and `append_rule_impl`.
5. **Crucially, there is no validation of the rules themselves.** The script blindly accepts and applies the rules defined in the custom configuration file.
6. When generating a configuration file with `-g`, the script includes rules to include the excluded paths, but the user controls the `--generate_using` option which can lead to overly broad rules if misused.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a file named `malicious_config.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "@version": "1.0.0",
     "allowed-log-paths-configuration": [
       {
         "directory-pattern": "/",
         "file-pattern": "*",
         "action": "INCLUDE"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   This configuration file contains a rule that includes all files and directories, effectively disabling almost all default exclusions.
2. Assume a sensitive log file exists at `/etc/shadow` (on Linux). This file should be excluded by default security rules.
3. Run the LogAgentSecurityRuleChecker.py script with the malicious configuration file:
   ```bash
   python LogAgentSecurityRulesChecker.py -o linux -c malicious_config.json /etc/shadow -v
   ```
4. Observe the output. The verbose output should show that the malicious rule `{ / }{ * }{ INCLUDE }` is matched and `/etc/shadow` is reported as "INCLUDED", despite default rules excluding `/etc/**/`.
5. This demonstrates that a malicious configuration file can override default security rules and lead to sensitive files being included.
