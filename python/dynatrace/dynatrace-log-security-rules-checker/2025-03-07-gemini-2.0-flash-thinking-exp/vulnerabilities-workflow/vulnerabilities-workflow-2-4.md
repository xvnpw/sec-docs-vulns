- Vulnerability Name: Security Rule Overriding via Malicious Custom Configuration File
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious custom configuration file (e.g., `malicious_config.json`).
    2. This malicious configuration file contains rules that weaken the default security rules or override them entirely. For example, it could include a rule that broadly includes all files, or specifically includes sensitive directories that are meant to be excluded by default.
    3. The attacker uses social engineering to trick a user into using the `LogAgentSecurityRulesChecker.py` script with the `-c` option, providing the path to the malicious configuration file.
    4. The user, believing they are testing or generating a legitimate configuration, runs the script with the malicious config.
    5. The script loads and applies the rules from the malicious configuration file, potentially overriding secure default rules.
    6. If the user then deploys a configuration based on the output of this script (especially if they use the `-g` option to generate a config file based on potentially weakened rules), the Dynatrace Log Agent might start ingesting logs from file paths that should be excluded for security reasons.
    7. This could lead to sensitive data being ingested into Dynatrace, violating security and privacy.
- Impact: Ingestion of sensitive data into Dynatrace that should have been excluded by security rules. This could include configuration files, secrets, or other confidential information, leading to potential data breaches or compliance violations.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The tool itself is a standalone script and doesn't directly deploy configurations. It only helps in testing and generating them. This limits the direct impact, as the user has to manually deploy the generated configuration.
    - The README.md provides some context on security rules and their importance, but it doesn't explicitly warn against using untrusted custom configuration files.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Warning about using untrusted configuration files:** The script should display a clear warning to users about the security risks of using custom configuration files from untrusted sources. This warning should be prominent in the help text and potentially when a custom configuration file is loaded.
    - **Input validation for configuration files:** The script could perform some basic validation on the structure and content of the custom configuration files to detect potentially malicious rules (e.g., overly broad INCLUDE rules that might override important EXCLUDE rules). However, this might be complex to implement effectively without hindering legitimate use cases.
    - **Principle of least privilege in generated configurations:** When generating configurations (using `-g`), the script should aim to generate the most restrictive rules necessary to include the desired log files, rather than overly broad rules. The current implementation seems to generate rules based on whole paths or parts of paths, which is a reasonable approach, but it's worth considering if there are ways to make the generated rules even more specific and less prone to accidental over-inclusion.
- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to create a malicious custom configuration file.
    2. The attacker needs to socially engineer a user into using the `LogAgentSecurityRulesChecker.py` script with the `-c` option and providing the path to the malicious configuration file.
    3. The user needs to deploy a configuration file based on the potentially weakened rules, either manually created or generated by the tool with the malicious config loaded.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Argument Parsing:** The script uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments, including `-c` or `--config_filenames` to load custom configuration files.
    ```python
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(...)
    parser.add_argument("-c", "--config_filenames", nargs='*', help="optional config file with custom rules")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    ```
    2. **Configuration File Loading:** The script iterates through the provided configuration filenames and loads JSON content from each file.
    ```python
    if args.config_filenames:
        args.config_filenames.sort(reverse=True, key=config_filepath_sort)
        for config_filename in args.config_filenames:
            if args.verbose:
                print("loading configuration file with custom rules: " + config_filename)
            with open(config_filename, 'r') as config_file:
                for item in json.loads(config_file.read())["allowed-log-paths-configuration"]:
                    rule = (item["directory-pattern"], item["file-pattern"], item["action"])
                    if rule[2] != "INCLUDE" and rule[2] != "EXCLUDE":
                        raise RuntimeError("invalid action type (only INCLUDE and EXCLUDE are allowed): " + rule[2])
                    append_rule(rules, rule, agent_adds_rule_with_suffix_automatically, args.verbose)
    ```
    - The code reads the JSON file and extracts rules from the `"allowed-log-paths-configuration"` array.
    - It validates that the "action" is either "INCLUDE" or "EXCLUDE".
    - It appends each rule using the `append_rule` function.
    - **Vulnerability Point:** There is no validation of the directory-pattern and file-pattern within the custom configuration file. A malicious user can define overly permissive patterns like `"directory-pattern": "/"`, `"file-pattern": "*"`, `"action": "INCLUDE"` which would effectively bypass most default EXCLUDE rules if loaded as a custom configuration. The sorting of configuration files using `config_filepath_sort` prioritizes `_migratedloganalytics.conf.json` and then `_loganalyticsconf.ctl.json`, but any other custom config provided via `-c` will be loaded after these, potentially overriding even intended custom configurations if they are loaded later.
    3. **Rule Application:** The script then proceeds to apply these rules (both custom and default) to the provided file paths. The order of rules is determined by the order they are loaded (custom configs first, then defaults). The first matching rule determines the action (INCLUDE or EXCLUDE).
    ```python
    for file_path in file_paths:
        ...
        for (dir_pattern, file_pattern, action) in rules:
            ...
            if dir_match and file_match:
                ...
                if action == "EXCLUDE":
                    excluded_paths.append(file_path)
                ...
                break # First matching rule wins
    ```
    - This logic means that a rule in a custom configuration file loaded via `-c` can override a default rule if it matches the same file path.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a malicious configuration file** named `malicious_config.json` with the following content. This configuration file adds a rule to INCLUDE all files from the root directory, effectively overriding default EXCLUDE rules.
    ```json
    {
      "@version": "1.0.0",
      "allowed-log-paths-configuration": [
        {
          "directory-pattern": "/",
          "file-pattern": "*",
          "action": "INCLUDE"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    2. **Run the `LogAgentSecurityRulesChecker.py` script** with the malicious configuration file and check a sensitive file path, for example, `/etc/shadow` on Linux.
    ```bash
    python LogAgentSecurityRulesChecker.py -o linux -c malicious_config.json /etc/shadow -v
    ```
    3. **Observe the output.** Without the malicious config, `/etc/shadow` should be EXCLUDED due to default rules. With the malicious config, the output should indicate that `/etc/shadow` is INCLUDED because the malicious rule overrides the default rules. In verbose mode, you should see the malicious rule being loaded and matched first.
    ```text
    loading configuration file with custom rules: malicious_config.json
    Adding a new rule with directory pattern = "/" filepattern = "*" and action = "INCLUDE"
    loading default configuration rules
    ...
    Matching '/etc/shadow'...
    Try to match rule { / }{ * }{ INCLUDE } to { / }{ etc/shadow } --- directory part MATCHED, file part MATCHED --- the rule is matched. '/etc/shadow' is INCLUDED.
    '/etc/shadow' is INCLUDED. Check verbose logs for more details.
    ```
    4. **Verify the impact.** If a user were to generate a configuration based on this check (e.g., using `-g`) and deploy it, the Log Agent would start attempting to ingest `/etc/shadow` if it were a log file, which is a clear security violation.

This vulnerability demonstrates how a maliciously crafted custom configuration file can weaken or bypass the intended security rules of the Dynatrace Log Agent, leading to the potential ingestion of sensitive data. The social engineering aspect is that an attacker needs to convince a user to utilize this malicious configuration file with the tool.
