- Vulnerability Name: **Weak Token Authentication in dt_webhook**
- Description:
    1. The `dt_webhook` plugin uses a static token for authentication, configured via the `token` parameter in the event source definition.
    2. This token is intended to be used in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when sending events to the webhook endpoint.
    3. If this token is weak (e.g., easily guessable, default value, exposed in logs or configuration), an attacker can potentially bypass the authentication.
    4. By crafting malicious events and sending them to the `dt_webhook` endpoint with a valid (or guessed) token, the attacker can trigger unintended Ansible actions defined in the rulebooks.
- Impact:
    - **High:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary Ansible actions on the systems managed by the Ansible Automation Platform. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, system disruption, or other malicious activities depending on the configured Ansible rulebooks and job templates.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Token-based authentication is implemented using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and verified in the `check_auth` middleware in `dt_webhook.py`.
    - The plugin checks for the presence of the `Authorization` header and validates the token against the configured token.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Token Complexity Enforcement:** There is no mechanism to enforce strong token generation or complexity requirements. Users might choose weak or easily guessable tokens.
    - **Token Rotation/Management:** No built-in mechanism for token rotation or management is provided. Static tokens are more vulnerable over time.
    - **Rate Limiting/Input Validation:** While JSON parsing is validated, there is no rate limiting on incoming requests or deeper validation of the event payload content to prevent abuse or unexpected behavior.
    - **Secret Storage:** The token is expected to be configured directly in the rulebook or a variable file, which might lead to it being stored in plaintext and potentially exposed in version control or logs. Secure secret storage mechanisms are not enforced or recommended.
- Preconditions:
    - The `dt_webhook` event source plugin must be configured in an Ansible rulebook.
    - The `dt_webhook` endpoint must be exposed and reachable by the attacker (e.g., if running on a publicly accessible EDA controller).
    - The attacker needs to obtain or guess a valid `dt_webhook` token. This could be achieved through:
        - Social engineering to obtain the token from administrators.
        - Guessing a weak or default token if used.
        - Discovering the token if it is inadvertently exposed (e.g., in logs, configuration files, or version control).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`extensions/eda/plugins/event_source/dt_webhook.py`:**
        - The `main` function starts the webhook server using `aiohttp`.
        - The `check_auth` middleware is applied to all routes, enforcing authentication.
        - **`check_auth` middleware:**
            ```python
            @web.middleware
            async def check_auth(request: web.Request, handler: Callable) -> web.StreamResponse:
                try:
                    scheme, token = request.headers["Authorization"].strip().split(" ")
                    _parse_auth_header(scheme, token, request.app["token"]) # Token validation
                except KeyError:
                    msg = "Authorization header is missing or not correct"
                    logger.exception(msg)
                    raise web.HTTPUnauthorized(reason=msg) from None
                except ValueError:
                    msg = "Invalid authorization header"
                    logger.exception(msg)
                    raise web.HTTPUnauthorized(reason=msg) from None
                return await handler(request)
            ```
            - Extracts the `Authorization` header, splits it into scheme and token.
            - Calls `_parse_auth_header` to validate the token.
        - **`_parse_auth_header` function:**
            ```python
            def _parse_auth_header(scheme: str, token: str, configured_token: str) -> None:
                """Check authorization type and token."""
                if scheme != "Bearer":
                    msg = f"Authorization type {scheme} is not allowed"
                    logger.error(msg)
                    raise web.HTTPUnauthorized(reason=msg) from None
                if token != configured_token: # Direct token comparison
                    msg = "Invalid authorization token"
                    logger.error(msg)
                    raise web.HTTPUnauthorized(reason=msg) from None
            ```
            - Checks if the scheme is "Bearer".
            - **Directly compares the provided `token` with the `configured_token` (which is the static token).**
            - Raises `HTTPUnauthorized` if validation fails.
        - **`_set_app_attributes` function:**
            ```python
            def _set_app_attributes(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
                # ... (Input validation for host, port, token presence) ...
                app_attrs = {}
                app_attrs["host"] = args.get("host")
                app_attrs["port"] = args.get("port")
                app_attrs["token"] = args.get("token") # Token is directly taken from args
                return app_attrs
            ```
            - Retrieves the token from the `args` dictionary passed to the `main` function. This `args` dictionary comes from the rulebook configuration.
    2. **`rulebooks/dt_webhook_event_example_rule.yml` and `docs/dt_webhook.md`:**
        - Example rulebooks and documentation show the token being configured directly in the rulebook or a `vars.yml` file as plaintext:
            ```yaml
            token: '{{ var_eda_token }}'
            ```
            ```yaml
            var_eda_token: <your-test-token>
            ```
        - This highlights the risk of storing and managing the token insecurely.

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the `dt_webhook` plugin in an Ansible EDA environment.
        - Configure a rulebook using `dt_webhook` as a source, setting a **weak token** (e.g., "weaktoken123").
        - Expose the `dt_webhook` endpoint (port and host) to be accessible for testing.
        - Configure a simple rule in the rulebook to run a playbook (e.g., `run-task.yml`) when a specific event is received. The playbook can simply print a message to indicate successful execution.
    2. **Attempt Exploit:**
        - **Step 1: No Token (Expected Fail):** Send a `POST` request to the `dt_webhook` endpoint (`/event`) without any `Authorization` header.
            ```bash
            curl -X POST http://<eda-controller-ip>:<dt_webhook-port>/event -d '{"eventData": {"test": "no token"}}'
            ```
            - **Expected Result:** The server should return an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` error, and the rulebook should not be triggered.
        - **Step 2: Incorrect Token (Expected Fail):** Send a `POST` request with an incorrect token in the `Authorization` header.
            ```bash
            curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer incorrecttoken" http://<eda-controller-ip>:<dt_webhook-port>/event -d '{"eventData": {"test": "incorrect token"}}'
            ```
            - **Expected Result:** The server should return an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` error, and the rulebook should not be triggered.
        - **Step 3: Weak Token (Expected Success - Vulnerability):** Send a `POST` request with the **weak token** configured in step 1 in the `Authorization` header.
            ```bash
            curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer weaktoken123" http://<eda-controller-ip>:<dt_webhook-port>/event -d '{"eventData": {"test": "weak token"}}'
            ```
            - **Expected Result:** The server should return an `HTTP 200 OK` response. The rulebook should be triggered, and the configured playbook (e.g., `run-task.yml`) should execute, printing the message defined in it. This successful execution demonstrates the vulnerability, as an attacker with the weak token could trigger actions.
    3. **Cleanup:**
        - Stop the `dt_webhook` plugin and EDA environment.

This test case demonstrates that if an attacker can guess or obtain the weak token, they can successfully bypass the authentication and trigger Ansible actions. This confirms the vulnerability.
