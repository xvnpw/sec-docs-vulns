### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Dynatrace API Token Exposure in dt_esa_api Plugin
- Description:
  - The `dt_esa_api` event source plugin is designed to poll Dynatrace for problem events using the Dynatrace API.
  - To authenticate with the Dynatrace API, the plugin requires a Dynatrace API token with `Read problems` and `Write problems` scopes.
  - This API token is configured as a parameter (`dt_api_token`) within the Ansible rulebook's source configuration.
  - If the Ansible rulebook or related configuration files (e.g., vars files) are not properly secured, the Dynatrace API token can be exposed to unauthorized users.
  - An attacker gaining access to this token can then directly interact with the Dynatrace API using the compromised token.
- Impact:
  - **Unauthorized Access to Dynatrace API:** An attacker who obtains the Dynatrace API token can use it to make API calls to the Dynatrace environment.
  - **Data Breach (Read Access):** With `Read problems` scope, the attacker can access sensitive problem data within Dynatrace, potentially including details about infrastructure, applications, and security issues.
  - **Data Manipulation (Write Access):** With `Write problems` scope, the attacker can modify problem data, such as adding misleading comments or manipulating problem states. This could disrupt incident response and monitoring efforts.
  - **Wider Dynatrace Environment Compromise:** Depending on the permissions associated with the compromised API token in Dynatrace, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges or gain access to other parts of the Dynatrace environment beyond problem data.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the code itself. The code directly uses the provided token for API authentication without any secure handling mechanisms.
  - The `README.md` provides example rulebooks that show the `dt_api_token` parameter, but it does not explicitly warn about the security risks of exposing the token or recommend secure storage practices.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secure Token Storage:** The project lacks any mechanism for secure storage or retrieval of the Dynatrace API token. It should not be stored in plaintext in rulebooks or easily accessible configuration files.
  - **Documentation on Secure Token Handling:** The documentation should explicitly warn users about the risks of exposing the API token and strongly recommend using secure methods for storing and managing secrets in Ansible, such as:
    - **Ansible Vault:** Encrypting sensitive data within Ansible files.
    - **Secrets Management Systems:** Integrating with external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk) to retrieve tokens at runtime.
    - **Environment Variables (with caution):**  Using environment variables to pass the token, but emphasizing the need to secure the environment where these variables are set.
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization (Limited Applicability):** While not directly mitigating token exposure, input validation on other parameters could prevent injection attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities (not present in this code).
- Preconditions:
  - **Access to Ansible Rulebooks or Configuration:** An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Ansible rulebooks or configuration files where the `dt_api_token` is stored in plaintext. This could be through:
    - **Compromised Version Control System:** If rulebooks are stored in a publicly accessible or compromised Git repository.
    - **Compromised Ansible Control Node:** If the attacker gains access to the Ansible control node's filesystem.
    - **Insider Threat:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to Ansible configurations.
  - **Plaintext Token Storage:** The user must have configured the `dt_esa_api` plugin by directly embedding the Dynatrace API token as a plaintext string in the `dt_api_token` parameter within the rulebook or a related configuration file.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/extensions/eda/plugins/event_source/dt_esa_api.py`
  - Function: `main(queue: asyncio.Queue, args: dict[str, Any])`
  - Line: `dt_api_token = args.get("dt_api_token")`
    - The `main` function retrieves the `dt_api_token` directly from the `args` dictionary, which is populated from the Ansible rulebook's `sources` configuration.
  - Function: `getproblems(dt_host: str, dt_token: str, proxy: str)` and `updatedtproblem(prob_id: str, dtapihost: str, dtapitoken: str, proxy: str)`
    - Both functions directly use the `dt_token` and `dtapitoken` parameters to construct the `Authorization` header for API requests to Dynatrace: `headers={"Authorization": f"Api-Token {dt_token}"}`.
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      Ansible Rulebook --> args (dict) --> dt_esa_api.py (main function) --> dt_api_token (plaintext) --> getproblems/updatedtproblem --> Dynatrace API Request (Authorization Header: Api-Token <plaintext_token>)
      ```
  - **No Secure Handling:** There is no code in `dt_esa_api.py` that implements any form of secure storage, encryption, or retrieval of the Dynatrace API token. The token is treated as a regular string parameter.
  - File: `/code/README.md`
  - Example rulebook:
    ```yaml
    sources:
      - dynatrace.event_driven_ansible.dt_esa_api:
          dt_api_host: "https://abc.live.dynatrace.com"
          dt_api_token: "asjfsjkfjfjh" # <--- Plaintext token in example
    ```
    - The example rulebook in the `README.md` explicitly shows the `dt_api_token` being set in plaintext, which, while intended as an example, can mislead users into insecure practices if they directly copy and paste this configuration into production environments without understanding the security implications.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Create a public GitHub repository (for demonstration purposes only; in a real security test, a private or internal testing environment would be used).
     - Create an Ansible rulebook `test_rulebook.yml` that uses the `dynatrace.event_driven_ansible.dt_esa_api` event source plugin.
     - In the `dt_api_token` parameter of the rulebook, directly embed a **test** Dynatrace API token with `Read problems` and `Write problems` scopes (create a dedicated test token for this purpose, **never use production tokens**).
     - Commit and push `test_rulebook.yml` to the public GitHub repository.
  2. **Attacker Action:**
     - An attacker (or security tester) browses the public GitHub repository and views the `test_rulebook.yml` file.
     - The attacker extracts the plaintext Dynatrace API token from the `dt_api_token` parameter in the rulebook.
  3. **Verification:**
     - The attacker uses a tool like `curl` or a Dynatrace API client to make an authenticated request to the Dynatrace API, using the extracted token. For example, to list problems:
       ```bash
       curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token <extracted_token>" "https://<your-dynatrace-environment>/api/v2/problems"
       ```
     - **Successful API Access:** If the attacker receives a valid response from the Dynatrace API (e.g., a JSON list of problems), it confirms that the API token has been successfully compromised and can be used to access the Dynatrace environment.
  4. **Cleanup:**
     - **Immediately revoke or delete the test Dynatrace API token** after the test to prevent any further unauthorized access.
     - Remove the `test_rulebook.yml` file from the public repository or make the repository private.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Webhook Token Exposure in dt_webhook Plugin
- Description:
  - The `dt_webhook` event source plugin is designed to receive events from Dynatrace via webhooks.
  - To secure the webhook endpoint, the plugin uses a token-based authentication mechanism.
  - This webhook token is configured as a parameter (`token`) within the Ansible rulebook's source configuration.
  - Similar to the `dt_esa_api` token, if the Ansible rulebook or related configuration files are not properly secured, the webhook token can be exposed.
  - An attacker obtaining this token could then send unauthorized events to the webhook endpoint, potentially triggering unintended Ansible automation.
- Impact:
  - **Unauthorized Event Injection:** An attacker with the webhook token can send arbitrary events to the `dt_webhook` endpoint.
  - **Triggering Unintended Automation:** By sending crafted events, the attacker could trigger Ansible rules and actions that are not intended to be executed, potentially leading to:
    - **Disruption of Services:** Triggering actions that disrupt normal operations.
    - **Resource Misuse:**  Causing Ansible to consume resources unnecessarily.
    - **Information Disclosure (Indirect):**  If the triggered Ansible actions involve accessing or processing sensitive data, the attacker might indirectly gain access to or manipulate this information.
  - **Limited Direct Dynatrace Impact:** This vulnerability primarily affects the Ansible automation triggered by the webhook and does not directly compromise the Dynatrace environment itself (unlike the `dt_esa_api` token exposure).
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the code itself. The code directly uses the provided token for webhook authentication without secure handling.
  - The `README.md` and example rulebooks use variables for the token (e.g., `'{{ <token_variable_name> }}'`), suggesting the use of Ansible variables, but do not explicitly address secure variable management.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Secure Token Storage (Same as dt_esa_api):**  The project lacks mechanisms for secure storage of the webhook token.
  - **Documentation on Secure Token Handling (Same as dt_esa_api):** The documentation should explicitly warn about the risks and recommend secure practices for managing the webhook token in Ansible.
- Preconditions:
  - **Access to Ansible Rulebooks or Configuration (Same as dt_esa_api):** An attacker must gain unauthorized access to the Ansible rulebooks or configuration files where the webhook `token` is stored, typically as a variable value in a `vars.yml` file or directly in the rulebook if inlined.
  - **Plaintext Token Storage (Similar to dt_esa_api):** The user must have configured the `dt_webhook` plugin by storing the webhook token in a way that is easily accessible in plaintext, rather than using secure variable management practices.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/extensions/eda/plugins/event_source/dt_webhook.py`
  - Function: `main(queue: asyncio.Queue, args: dict[str, Any])`
  - Line: `app["token"] = app_attrs["token"]`
    - The `main` function retrieves the `token` from the `args` dictionary and stores it in the application context (`app["token"]`). This token is then used for authentication.
  - Middleware: `check_auth(request: web.Request, handler: Callable)`
  - Function: `_parse_auth_header(scheme: str, token: str, configured_token: str)`
    - The `check_auth` middleware intercepts incoming webhook requests and calls `_parse_auth_header` to validate the `Authorization` header against the `configured_token` (which is `app["token"]` from `main`).
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      Ansible Rulebook --> args (dict) --> dt_webhook.py (main function) --> token (plaintext) --> check_auth middleware --> _parse_auth_header --> Webhook Request (Authorization Header: Bearer <plaintext_token>)
      ```
  - **No Secure Handling:** Similar to `dt_esa_api`, the `dt_webhook` plugin code does not implement secure token storage or handling.
  - File: `/code/README.md` and `/code/rulebooks/dt_webhook_event_example_rule.yml`
  - Example Rulebook Snippets:
    ```yaml
    # README.md
    sources:
      - dynatrace.event_driven_ansible.dt_webhook:
          token: '{{ <token_variable_name> }}'

    # rulebooks/dt_webhook_event_example_rule.yml
    sources:
      - dynatrace.event_driven_ansible.dt_webhook:
          token: '{{ var_eda_token }}'
    ```
    - The examples use Ansible variables to represent the token, which is a step towards better practice compared to hardcoding. However, they rely on the user to properly define and secure these variables (e.g., in `vars.yml`), and the documentation does not provide explicit guidance on secure variable management for tokens.
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup:**
     - Create a public GitHub repository (for demonstration purposes).
     - Create an Ansible rulebook `webhook_rulebook.yml` that uses the `dynatrace.event_driven_ansible.dt_webhook` event source plugin.
     - In the `webhook_rulebook.yml`, configure the `token` parameter to use a variable, e.g., `token: '{{ webhook_test_token }}'`.
     - Create a `vars.yml` file in the same directory as `webhook_rulebook.yml`.
     - In `vars.yml`, define the `webhook_test_token` variable and set its value to a **test** webhook token (generate a random string for this test).
     - Commit and push both `webhook_rulebook.yml` and `vars.yml` to the public GitHub repository.
  2. **Attacker Action:**
     - An attacker browses the public GitHub repository and views the `vars.yml` file.
     - The attacker extracts the plaintext webhook token from the `webhook_test_token` variable.
  3. **Verification:**
     - The attacker uses `curl` to send a POST request to the `dt_webhook` endpoint, including the extracted token in the `Authorization` header:
       ```bash
       curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <extracted_webhook_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"eventData": {"test": "event"}}' http://<ansible-rulebook-host>:<port>/event
       ```
     - **Successful Event Reception:** If the Ansible rulebook processes the event (e.g., logs the event details or triggers an action), it confirms that the attacker was able to successfully authenticate with the webhook using the compromised token and send events.
  4. **Cleanup:**
     - **Immediately change or invalidate the test webhook token** after the test.
     - Remove the `webhook_rulebook.yml` and `vars.yml` files from the public repository or make the repository private.
