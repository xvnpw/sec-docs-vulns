#### Vulnerability 1: Insecure Storage of Dynatrace API Tokens in Extension Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the ActiveGate file system where the Insightify extension is deployed.
    2. The attacker locates the extension's configuration file (typically within the ActiveGate's plugin deployment directory).
    3. The configuration file stores Dynatrace API tokens in plain text, including tokens for both data retrieval and metric publishing.
    4. The attacker extracts these plain text API tokens from the configuration file.
    5. Using these tokens, the attacker can now directly access the configured Dynatrace tenant, bypassing any extension-level access controls.
    6. The attacker can read sensitive monitoring data using the read token and potentially manipulate Dynatrace configurations or ingest malicious metrics using the publish token, depending on the scopes of the compromised tokens.

* Impact:
    * **Critical impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace monitoring data.
    * Potential for data exfiltration, allowing attackers to gain insights into the monitored environment's performance, security posture, and business operations.
    * Possibility of configuration manipulation in the Dynatrace tenant if the publish token has write scopes, leading to disruption of monitoring, data corruption, or even further security breaches within the monitored environment.
    * Potential for ingesting malicious metrics, leading to false alerts, skewed dashboards, and undermining the integrity of the monitoring data.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The code directly retrieves and uses tokens from the configuration without any evident security measures.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Secure storage of API tokens:** Implement encryption for storing API tokens in the extension configuration file. Use a secure vault or key management system if possible within the ActiveGate environment.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Dynatrace:**  While not a mitigation in the extension itself, proper RBAC in Dynatrace is crucial to limit the impact of compromised tokens. Ensure tokens are granted only the minimum necessary permissions (least privilege principle).
    * **Input validation and sanitization:** Although not directly related to token storage, ensure all configuration inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks, which could indirectly lead to configuration file manipulation.

* Preconditions:
    * The Insightify extension must be deployed on an ActiveGate.
    * An attacker must gain access to the ActiveGate's file system. This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities in the ActiveGate itself, compromised credentials, or insider threats.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/EF1.0/src/insightify.py, File: /code/src/EF2.0/src/insightify/__main__.py**
    2. **`initialize` function:**
        ```python
        self.url = self.config.get("url", "https://demo.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/")
        self.password = self.config.get("token", "admin")
        self.confurl = self.config.get("confurl","https://push.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/")
        self.conf_password = self.config.get("conftoken", "Token")
        ```
        ```python
        for endpoint in self.activation_config["endpoints"]:
           url = endpoint["url"]
           # ...
        ```
    3. The `initialize` function in both `EF1.0` and `EF2.0` versions retrieves `token` and `conftoken` using `self.config.get()`. Similarly, in `EF2.0`, the `query` function iterates through `self.activation_config["endpoints"]` and accesses `endpoint["token"]` and `endpoint["conftoken"]`.
    4. **Visualization:**

    ```
    Configuration File --> config.get("token") --> self.password (plain text in memory) --> dtApi* functions (used in API calls)
                      \--> config.get("conftoken") -> self.conf_password (plain text in memory) -> dtApi* functions (used in API calls)
    ```
    5. The code directly uses these retrieved tokens (`self.password`, `self.conf_password`, `endpoint["token"]`, `endpoint["conftoken"]`) in subsequent API calls within functions like `dtApiQuery`, `dtApiV2GetQuery`, `dtApiIngestMetrics`, and others.
    6. There is no code present to encrypt or securely handle these tokens at any point within the provided source code.  The tokens are treated as plain text strings throughout the extension's lifecycle.
    7. This indicates that the extension relies on storing API tokens in plain text within its configuration, making them easily accessible if the configuration file is compromised.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** You need access to an ActiveGate where the Insightify extension is installed and configured with Dynatrace API tokens. For testing purposes, you can set up a local ActiveGate and deploy the extension.
    2. **Step 1: Locate Extension Configuration:** Access the ActiveGate file system. Navigate to the plugin deployment directory (e.g., `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/` or `/var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/` depending on the ActiveGate type and OS). Find the directory for the Insightify extension (likely named `custom.remote.python.insightify` or similar based on `extension.yaml` name).
    3. **Step 2: Examine Configuration File:** Inside the extension directory, look for configuration files. The exact file name might vary, but it could be named something like `config.json`, `plugin.json`, or similar.  If using Extension Framework 2.0, check `activation.json` or files referenced in `extension.yaml`.
    4. **Step 3: Verify Plain Text Tokens:** Open the configuration file in a text editor. Search for the configuration parameters related to Dynatrace API tokens, such as "token", "conftoken", "password", "conf_password", or similar parameter names used in the `initialize` and `query` functions.
    5. **Step 4: Confirm Plain Text Storage:** Verify that the values associated with these parameters are the actual Dynatrace API tokens in plain text. They should be directly readable strings without any encryption or obfuscation.
    6. **Step 5: (Optional) API Access Verification:** Copy one of the extracted plain text API tokens. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to make a direct API request to the configured Dynatrace tenant using the extracted token for authorization. For example:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token <extracted_token>" "<tenant_url>/api/v2/problems"
        ```
        Replace `<extracted_token>` with the token and `<tenant_url>` with the tenant URL from the configuration.
    7. **Step 6: Verify Successful API Access:** If the API request in Step 6 is successful (returns a 200 OK status and problem data in the response), it confirms that the extracted plain text token is valid and grants unauthorized access to the Dynatrace tenant.

This test case demonstrates that API tokens are stored in plain text in the extension configuration, confirming the vulnerability.
