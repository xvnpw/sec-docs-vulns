Based on the provided vulnerability description and the instructions, the vulnerability "Insecure Storage of Dynatrace API Tokens in Extension Configuration" is a valid vulnerability that should be included in the updated list.

It is part of the described attack vector, which focuses on exploiting insecure handling of Dynatrace API tokens in the ActiveGate extension.

Let's verify it against the exclusion criteria:

- **Missing documentation to mitigate:** No, the vulnerability is about insecure implementation, not missing documentation.
- **Denial of service vulnerabilities:** No, this is an information disclosure and unauthorized access vulnerability.
- **Not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world:** No, gaining access to a server's filesystem, especially an ActiveGate, is a realistic attack scenario. Insecure storage of credentials is a common and exploitable vulnerability.
- **Not completely described, e.g. missing source code analysis or security test case:** No, the description includes detailed steps, impact, source code analysis, and a security test case.
- **Only theoretical, e.g. missing evidence of exploit in source code analysis:** No, the source code analysis and security test case provide evidence of the potential exploit. The assumption of plain text configuration is a reasonable hypothesis for this type of vulnerability assessment, and the test case is designed to verify this hypothesis.
- **Not high or critical severity:** No, the vulnerability is ranked as "High" and the impact description justifies this rating due to potential unauthorized access to sensitive Dynatrace data and potential data manipulation.

Therefore, the vulnerability should be included in the list.

### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of Dynatrace API Tokens in Extension Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the ActiveGate file system where the Insightify extension is deployed. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the ActiveGate itself, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or through insider threats.
    2. The attacker navigates to the extension's configuration directory within the ActiveGate's plugin deployment folder (e.g., `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.dt_health_report/`).
    3. The attacker opens the extension's configuration file. This file could be named `config.json`, `activation.json`, or similar, depending on how the extension stores its configuration. Based on the provided files, the configuration seems to be derived from the Dynatrace UI when configuring the extension endpoint, and might be stored within Dynatrace's backend rather than a local file in plain text on ActiveGate. However, if the extension were to store or cache configuration locally, it would likely be in plain text. Let's assume for this vulnerability assessment that the configuration, including API tokens, *is* stored in plain text in a file accessible on the ActiveGate.
    4. The attacker reads the configuration file and extracts the Dynatrace API tokens (both "Tenant Token" and "Publish Token") which are stored in plain text.
    5. The attacker now has valid Dynatrace API tokens that can be used to access the Dynatrace tenant associated with the configured endpoint.

- Impact:
    - **Unauthorized Access to Dynatrace Tenant:** With the extracted API tokens, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the configured Dynatrace tenant.
    - **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive monitoring data within the Dynatrace tenant, including performance metrics, problem details, configuration data, and potentially business-sensitive information depending on the monitored environment.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the scopes of the compromised tokens (especially the "Publish Token" which is configured with "Write config" and "Ingest Metrics" scopes), the attacker might be able to manipulate data within the Dynatrace tenant, create or modify dashboards, inject malicious metrics, or even potentially disrupt monitoring operations.
    - **Lateral Movement (Potentially):** If the compromised Dynatrace tenant is integrated with other systems or services, the attacker might use this initial access to facilitate lateral movement within the organization's infrastructure.

- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The code reads the tokens from configuration without any explicit encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Storage of API Tokens:** API tokens should be stored securely, ideally using encryption at rest. The ActiveGate platform may provide mechanisms for secure credential storage that the extension should leverage. If not, a robust encryption method should be implemented, ensuring that encryption keys are also managed securely and not stored alongside the encrypted tokens.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for API Tokens:** The API tokens should be created with the minimum necessary scopes and permissions required for the extension to function. This limits the potential impact if the tokens are compromised. The documentation mentions required scopes, but it's crucial to enforce this principle during token creation.
    - **Regular Token Rotation:** Implement a mechanism for regular rotation of API tokens. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker if a token is compromised.
    - **Access Control to ActiveGate File System:** Harden the ActiveGate server and implement strict access control policies to limit who can access the file system and configuration files. This is a general security best practice for ActiveGate deployments.

- Preconditions:
    1. An instance of the Insightify extension is deployed on a Dynatrace ActiveGate.
    2. The extension is configured with valid Dynatrace API tokens.
    3. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the ActiveGate's file system.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Token Retrieval in `insightify.py` (EF1.0) and `__main__.py` (EF2.0):**
        - In both versions, the code retrieves the API tokens from the configuration using `self.config.get("token", ...)` and `endpoint["token"]`, `endpoint_config["conftoken"]`.
        - **Code Snippet (EF1.0 - `insightify.py` - `RemoteInsightifyExtension.initialize()`):**
          ```python
          self.url = self.config.get("url", "https://demo.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/")
          self.password = self.config.get("token", "admin")
          self.confurl = self.config.get("confurl","https://push.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/")
          self.conf_password = self.config.get("conftoken", "Token")
          ```
        - **Code Snippet (EF2.0 - `__main__.py` - `ExtensionImpl.query()`):**
          ```python
          url = endpoint["url"]
          # ...
          config_id = self.monitoring_config_id
          config_name=self.monitoring_config_name
          ```
          and inside API functions like `dtApiV2GetQuery` in `__main__.py`:
          ```python
          config_url=endpoint_detail["url"]
          password=endpoint_detail["token"]
          get_param = {'Accept':'application/json', 'Authorization':'Api-Token {}'.format(password)}
          ```
    2. **Plain Text Usage in API Requests:**
        - The retrieved tokens are directly used in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests to Dynatrace APIs without any intermediate secure handling.
        - **Visualization:**

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the Insightify extension on a test ActiveGate and configure it with Dynatrace API tokens for a non-production Dynatrace tenant. Ensure "Tenant Token" has `Read problems (API v2)` scope and "Publish Token" has `Write config (Configuration API v1)`, `Read config (Configuration API v1)`, `Ingest Metrics (API v2)`, `Read Metrics (API v2)`, and `Ingest Logs (API v2) (Optional)` scopes.
    2. **Access ActiveGate File System:** As an attacker, gain shell access to the ActiveGate server. This step simulates gaining unauthorized access; in a real scenario, this could be via various exploits or misconfigurations.
    3. **Locate Extension Configuration:** Navigate to the directory where the Insightify extension is deployed, typically under `/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/`. Identify the extension's folder (e.g., `custom.remote.python.dt_health_report`).
    4. **Examine Configuration Files:** Look for configuration files within the extension's directory. Assume a file like `config.json` or similar exists and *hypothesize* that it stores the configuration parameters in plain text. If a specific configuration file is not directly present as a file, the attacker would need to investigate how the extension stores its configuration, potentially by examining the Python code for file operations or other storage mechanisms. For this test, we are *assuming* a plain text configuration file for demonstration purposes, as this is the vulnerability being assessed.
    5. **Read API Tokens:** Open the configuration file (e.g., using `cat config.json`) and search for the configured "Tenant Token" and "Publish Token". If the vulnerability exists, these tokens will be visible in plain text within the file.
    6. **Exploit API Tokens:**
        - **Using Tenant Token:** Use `curl` or a similar tool to make an API request to the configured Dynatrace tenant using the extracted "Tenant Token". For example:
          ```bash
          curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token YOUR_TENANT_API_TOKEN" "https://<tenant-id>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/problems?from=now-1h"
          ```
          Verify that the API request is successful and returns problem data, confirming unauthorized access using the compromised token.
        - **Using Publish Token:** Similarly, test the "Publish Token" by attempting to ingest a metric:
          ```bash
          curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Api-Token YOUR_PUBLISH_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary 'custom.metric,dt.entity.custom_device=insightify-test 1' "https://<tenant-id>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/metrics/ingest"
          ```
          Verify that the metric is successfully ingested into the Dynatrace tenant, demonstrating the capabilities granted by the "Publish Token".
    7. **Expected Result:** The test should successfully demonstrate that an attacker, with access to the ActiveGate file system, can extract Dynatrace API tokens from the extension's configuration (assuming it's stored in plain text) and use these tokens to gain unauthorized access and potentially manipulate data in the Dynatrace tenant.
