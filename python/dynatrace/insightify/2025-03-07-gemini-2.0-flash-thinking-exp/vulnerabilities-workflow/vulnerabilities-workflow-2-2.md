- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of Dynatrace API Tokens in Extension Configuration

- **Description:**
  1. A user configures the Insightify extension within their Dynatrace tenant.
  2. During configuration, the user is required to input sensitive Dynatrace API tokens (Tenant Token and Publish Token) directly into the extension's configuration fields within the Dynatrace UI.
  3. These tokens, once configured, are stored as part of the extension's configuration.
  4. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Dynatrace tenant's settings or the ActiveGate where the extension is deployed, they could potentially retrieve these stored API tokens from the extension's configuration.
  5. With the stolen API tokens, the attacker can then gain unauthorized access to the Dynatrace tenant, potentially allowing them to read sensitive monitoring data, modify configurations, or perform other actions depending on the scopes of the compromised tokens.

- **Impact:**
  - **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive monitoring data within the Dynatrace tenant.
  - **Integrity Breach:** Attackers might be able to modify Dynatrace configurations if the stolen tokens have write scopes.
  - **Account Takeover:** In severe cases, depending on the token scopes, attackers could potentially gain control over aspects of the Dynatrace tenant.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None in the provided project files. The project relies on the user to securely manage the API tokens during configuration.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Masking/Obfuscation:** While not full mitigation, masking the token input fields in the Dynatrace UI can reduce accidental exposure during configuration.
  - **Warning Documentation:**  Documentation should strongly emphasize the critical importance of securely managing Dynatrace API tokens. It should advise users against using highly privileged tokens if not necessary and highlight the risks of exposing these tokens.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Documentation should guide users to create API tokens with the minimum necessary scopes required for the extension to function, limiting the potential impact of token compromise.
  - **Secure Configuration Practices Guidance:** Documentation should recommend best practices for securing Dynatrace tenant configurations and ActiveGate access to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to extension configurations.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. The Insightify extension is installed and configured within a Dynatrace tenant.
  2. A user with sufficient privileges to manage Dynatrace extensions exists.
  3. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Dynatrace tenant's settings or the ActiveGate environment where the extension is deployed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. **Configuration Retrieval:** In both `src/EF1.0/src/insightify.py` and `src/EF2.0/src/insightify/__main__.py`, the code retrieves API tokens from the extension's configuration using `self.config.get("token", ...)` and `endpoint["token"]` respectively.
  2. **Token Usage:** The retrieved tokens are used directly in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests made to the Dynatrace API. For example, in `dtApiV2GetQuery` and `dtApiIngestMetrics` functions in both versions of the code.
  3. **No Secure Storage:** There is no evidence in the provided code of any attempt to securely store or encrypt the API tokens. The tokens are treated as plain strings within the configuration.
  4. **Vulnerable Configuration UI (External to Code):** The vulnerability is not within the provided Python code itself but rather in the inherent risk of storing sensitive credentials in extension configurations within the Dynatrace platform, if access to these configurations is not sufficiently controlled. The extension code directly uses the configured tokens, making it reliant on the security of the Dynatrace configuration mechanism.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Install and configure the Insightify extension on a Dynatrace ActiveGate and tenant.
     - Configure the extension with valid Dynatrace API tokens (both Tenant Token and Publish Token).
     - Ensure the extension is functioning and collecting metrics.
  2. **Access Extension Configuration (Simulate Attacker Access):**
     - **Scenario 1: Tenant UI Access:** As an attacker with unauthorized access to the Dynatrace tenant UI (e.g., through compromised credentials or session hijacking), navigate to the extension's configuration page within **Settings > Monitored technologies > Custom extensions > Insightify > [Your Endpoint]**.
     - **Scenario 2: ActiveGate File System Access (If possible in test environment):**  If you have access to the ActiveGate file system (e.g., through compromised ActiveGate credentials), attempt to locate the extension's configuration files. (Note: Direct file system access to configuration might be restricted by Dynatrace).
  3. **Retrieve API Tokens:**
     - **Scenario 1:** Examine the configuration fields in the Dynatrace UI. Observe if the API tokens are displayed in plaintext or can be revealed through browser developer tools or API calls to the Dynatrace configuration API.
     - **Scenario 2:** If file system access is possible, inspect the configuration files for plaintext API tokens.
  4. **Verify Unauthorized Access:**
     - Using the retrieved API tokens, attempt to authenticate against the Dynatrace API (e.g., using `curl` or `Postman) and perform actions that should be authorized by the token scopes (e.g., retrieve monitoring data, modify settings if write scopes are present).
  5. **Expected Result:**
     - The API tokens should be retrievable from the extension configuration (either via UI or potentially file system if accessible).
     - Using the retrieved tokens, the attacker should be able to successfully authenticate to the Dynatrace API and perform actions, demonstrating unauthorized access.

This test case proves that if an attacker gains access to the Dynatrace tenant configuration or the ActiveGate, they can potentially retrieve and misuse the API tokens configured for the Insightify extension, leading to unauthorized access.
