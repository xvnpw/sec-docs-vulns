Based on the provided vulnerability report and the instructions, let's evaluate if the vulnerability should be included in the updated list.

The vulnerability is:

- Vulnerability Name: HTTP Header Injection in Web Request Tracing
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

According to the instructions, we should:

**Include** only valid vulnerabilities that are part of attack vector.
**Exclude** vulnerabilities that:
- are only missing documentation to mitigate.
- are deny of service vulnerabilities.
- are not realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world.
- are not completely described.
- are only theoretical.
- are not high or critical severity.

The provided vulnerability:

- Is a valid vulnerability and part of attack vector (HTTP Header Injection is a known attack).
- Is not only missing documentation.
- Is not a deny of service vulnerability.
- Is realistic for attacker to exploit in real-world.
- Is completely described with source code analysis and security test case.
- Is not theoretical, evidence of exploit in source code analysis and test case are provided.
- Is ranked as **Medium severity**, which means it falls under the exclusion criteria of "not high or critical severity".

Since the vulnerability is ranked as Medium severity and the instruction is to exclude vulnerabilities that are not high or critical severity, this vulnerability should be excluded from the list.

Therefore, the updated list should be empty.
