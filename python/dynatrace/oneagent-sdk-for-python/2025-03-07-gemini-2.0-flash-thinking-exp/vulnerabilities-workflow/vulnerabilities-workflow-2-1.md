- Vulnerability Name: Unsanitized Input in Tracing Functions
- Description:
    - An attacker can inject malicious data into various input fields of the SDK tracing functions, specifically `trace_incoming_web_request` and `trace_incoming_remote_call`.
    - These input fields include:
        - For `trace_incoming_web_request`: URI, headers, and parameters.
        - For `trace_incoming_remote_call`: method, service, and endpoint.
    - The SDK, as a wrapper, passes this data to the Dynatrace backend.
    - If Dynatrace dashboards or alerts do not properly sanitize or encode this data before displaying it, an attacker could potentially manipulate the Dynatrace UI.
    - This could lead to various issues, such as:
        - Displaying misleading or incorrect information in dashboards.
        - Triggering false alerts or suppressing genuine alerts by injecting crafted data that bypasses alert conditions or mimics normal behavior.
        - In extreme cases, if Dynatrace UI is vulnerable to client-side injection, it might lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if malicious scripts are injected through these fields and executed within the Dynatrace dashboard context (though this is less likely and depends on Dynatrace's UI security).
- Impact:
    - Manipulation of Dynatrace dashboards and alerts.
    - Injection of misleading information, potentially causing confusion and incorrect interpretations of monitoring data.
    - Masking of real issues or triggering false alarms, leading to operational disruptions or ignored critical events.
    - Potential, but less likely, client-side injection vulnerabilities in the Dynatrace UI if it improperly handles the unsanitized data from the SDK.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input sanitization or output encoding is implemented within the provided Python SDK code.
    - The SDK functions appear to directly pass the provided input strings to the underlying C/C++ SDK without any validation or sanitization.
    - There is no evidence of mitigation within the provided project files.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization within the Python SDK before passing data to the C/C++ SDK.
    - Implementations of sanitization should focus on escaping or encoding special characters in the input fields of tracing functions to prevent injection attacks.
    - Consider input validation to limit the length and allowed characters for these fields to further reduce the attack surface.
- Preconditions:
    - A Python application that utilizes the Dynatrace OneAgent SDK for Python.
    - The application must be using `trace_incoming_web_request` or `trace_incoming_remote_call` functions.
    - User-controlled input or data derived from external requests is used as arguments for these tracing functions (e.g., URI, headers, parameters, method, service, endpoint).
    - Dynatrace environment is configured to display dashboards or generate alerts based on the data monitored by the OneAgent SDK.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Review of `README.md` examples for `trace_incoming_web_request` and `trace_incoming_remote_call` shows direct usage of input data without sanitization before being passed to the SDK functions.
    - Analysis of `/code/src/oneagent/sdk/tracers.py` and `/code/src/oneagent/sdk/__init__.py` reveals that these files primarily define the SDK's Python interface and act as wrappers around the underlying C/C++ SDK.
    - No explicit sanitization or encoding logic is present in the Python SDK code for the input fields of the mentioned tracing functions.
    - The code in `src/oneagent/_impl/native/sdkctypesiface.py` indicates that the Python SDK calls C/C++ functions, suggesting that the input strings are passed to the native C/C++ SDK for further processing.
    - Without inspecting the C/C++ SDK source code (which is in a separate repository not provided), we must assume no sanitization occurs in the Python SDK layer based on the provided files.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a Python application instrumented with Dynatrace OneAgent SDK for Python. Ensure that the application uses `trace_incoming_web_request` to trace incoming HTTP requests, using the request URI and headers directly as input to the tracing function.
    2. Access the application with a crafted HTTP request designed to inject potentially malicious content into Dynatrace. Example malicious requests:
        - Send a GET request to `/vulnerable-path?attribute=<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
        - Send a GET request with a header `User-Agent: <script>alert('header-xss')</script>`
    3. Log in to the Dynatrace monitoring environment and navigate to the dashboard or views that display data from the instrumented application (e.g., service overview, request attributes, logs if integrated).
    4. Examine the Dynatrace UI to see if the injected payloads are rendered as intended by the attacker, indicating a potential injection vulnerability. Specifically, check if:
        - The injected JavaScript code (e.g., `alert('XSS')`) executes within the Dynatrace dashboard.
        - HTML tags (e.g., `<img>`) are rendered as HTML instead of being displayed as plain text.
        - Any injected data is displayed in a way that could be misleading or disruptive in the context of monitoring data.
    5. If the injected code is executed or rendered without sanitization within the Dynatrace UI, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    6. Repeat the test for `trace_incoming_remote_call`, injecting malicious data into the `method`, `service`, and `endpoint` parameters and checking for similar unsanitized rendering in the Dynatrace UI.
