- vulnerability name: Potential Chaincode Query/Invoke Injection
- description: |
    1. An attacker provides malicious input data through the application's user interface.
    2. The application, without proper sanitization, uses this input as arguments (`args`) in a `chaincode_query` or `chaincode_invoke` API call of the Fabric SDK.
    3. The Fabric SDK constructs a Hyperledger Fabric transaction proposal using these unsanitized arguments.
    4. This transaction proposal is sent to the Hyperledger Fabric network.
    5. If the chaincode is vulnerable to injection (e.g., due to dynamic query construction in the chaincode logic using the unsanitized input), the attacker's malicious input can be executed within the chaincode's context.
- impact: |
    - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker may be able to read, modify, or delete data on the Hyperledger Fabric ledger depending on the chaincode's logic and the nature of the injection vulnerability within the chaincode.
    - **Chaincode Logic Bypass:** An attacker might bypass intended chaincode logic or access functionalities not meant for public access.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data stored on the ledger could be exposed to the attacker.
- vulnerability rank: medium
- currently implemented mitigations: No direct mitigations are implemented in the SDK to sanitize user input within the `chaincode_query` or `chaincode_invoke` API calls. The SDK relies on the application developer to perform input sanitization.
- missing mitigations: |
    - **Input Sanitization Guidance:** The SDK documentation should prominently feature guidelines and best practices for sanitizing user inputs before using them in SDK API calls, particularly `chaincode_query` and `chaincode_invoke`.
    - **Example Sanitization Code:**  Providing code examples demonstrating input sanitization techniques within the SDK's tutorial and documentation would be beneficial.
- preconditions: |
    - The application using the Fabric SDK must accept user-provided input that is incorporated into chaincode API calls.
    - The chaincode deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric network must be susceptible to injection vulnerabilities if it directly processes unsanitized input from the SDK API calls (e.g., using string concatenation to build queries).
- source code analysis: |
    - File: `/code/docs/source/tutorial.md`
    - In the "3. Operate Chaincodes with Fabric Network" section, the tutorial demonstrates the use of `cli.chaincode_query` and `cli.chaincode_invoke` API calls.
    - The `args` parameter in these calls is taken directly as a list of strings:
    ```python
    # Query a chaincode
    args = ['b'] # <-- User input can influence this 'args' list
    # The response should be true if succeed
    response = loop.run_until_complete(cli.chaincode_query(
                   requestor=org1_admin,
                   channel_name='businesschannel',
                   peers=['peer0.org1.example.com'],
                   args=args, # Unsanitized 'args' is passed to chaincode_query
                   cc_name='example_cc'
                   ))
    ```
    - If an application directly takes user input and places it into the `args` list without sanitization, and the chaincode is programmed to dynamically interpret these arguments (e.g., as part of a database query or conditional logic), it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.
- security test case: |
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a vulnerable chaincode to the Hyperledger Fabric network. This chaincode will be designed to be vulnerable to injection attacks if unsanitized input is provided in the `args` parameter of the `chaincode_query` API. For example, the chaincode could construct a query by directly concatenating strings from the `args` input.
    2. **Attack:**
        - Craft a malicious input string designed to exploit the injection vulnerability in the deployed chaincode. For example, if the chaincode is expected to query based on marble name, a malicious input could be something like `'marble' UNION SELECT * FROM marbles; --`.
        - Using the Fabric SDK Python library, construct a `chaincode_query` call.
        - Pass the malicious input string as part of the `args` parameter in the `chaincode_query` call.
        - Execute the `chaincode_query` call against the Hyperledger Fabric network.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the response from the `chaincode_query` call.
        - If the chaincode is indeed vulnerable and the malicious input is successfully injected, the response will reflect the outcome of the injected code execution. For example, in a SQL injection scenario, the response might contain data beyond what a normal query should return, or indicate an error from the database due to the injected SQL.
