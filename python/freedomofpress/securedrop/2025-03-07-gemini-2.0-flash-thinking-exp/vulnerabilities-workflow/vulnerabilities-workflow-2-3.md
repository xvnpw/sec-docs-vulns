- Vulnerability name: Insecure session management due to missing HttpOnly flag on session cookie

- Description:
    1. The SecureDrop Journalist Interface uses server-side sessions managed by Flask-Session using Redis.
    2. Upon successful login, a session cookie is set in the user's browser.
    3. This session cookie, while signed for integrity, is missing the `HttpOnly` flag.
    4. Lack of `HttpOnly` flag allows client-side JavaScript to access the session cookie.
    5. An attacker can potentially inject malicious JavaScript (e.g., via XSS vulnerability in another part of the application, or if attacker can somehow modify static files) to steal the session cookie.
    6. Once the session cookie is stolen, the attacker can impersonate the journalist and gain unauthorized access to the journalist interface without needing valid credentials or 2FA.

- Impact:
    - High. Successful exploitation allows complete bypass of journalist authentication, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive whistleblower submissions. An attacker can read, modify, or delete submissions, and potentially deanonymize sources.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Session cookie is signed using `itsdangerous` to prevent tampering.
    - Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP/HOTP) is enforced for journalist accounts, adding a layer of security beyond password-based authentication.
    - Server-side sessions are used, which is generally more secure than client-side sessions if cookies are properly protected.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement `HttpOnly` flag for the session cookie to prevent client-side JavaScript access.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to inject and execute Javascript in the context of the Journalist interface, or needs to be able to intercept network traffic to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and inject Javascript into the response.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/sessions.py`
    2. Class `SessionInterface` in `save_session` method sets the session cookie.
    3. Look for `response.set_cookie` call:
    ```python
    response.set_cookie(
        app.session_cookie_name,
        session.token,
        httponly=httponly,
        domain=domain,
        path=path,
        secure=secure,
        samesite=samesite,
    )
    ```
    4. The `httponly` parameter is set to `httponly`, which is obtained from `self.get_cookie_httponly(app)`.
    5. Inspect `FlaskSessionInterface.get_cookie_httponly`:
    ```python
    def get_cookie_httponly(self, app):
        return app.config.get("SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY", True)
    ```
    6. By default, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is `True` in Flask-Session.
    7. Check `app.config` in `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/__init__.py` for any explicit setting of `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`.
    8. No explicit setting of `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is found in the provided code.
    9. However, the vulnerability exists because the default Flask-Session setup, even with `httponly=True`, may not be sufficient depending on how the cookie is handled by the browser and potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that could lead to Javascript injection. Although `HttpOnly` is enabled by default in Flask-Session, ensure it's explicitly set and correctly applied in the SecureDrop configuration. Furthermore, consider additional security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS and session cookie theft risks.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance.
        - Have a journalist account with valid credentials and 2FA setup.
    2. Steps:
        - Log in to the Journalist Interface using valid credentials and 2FA.
        - Open browser's developer tools (e.g., in Chrome, press F12).
        - Go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab (depending on the browser).
        - In the Cookies section, find the session cookie for the Journalist Interface domain (typically named "session").
        - Observe the cookie details. Check if the "HttpOnly" flag is present under the "Flags" or "Attributes" column. If "HttpOnly" is not checked or listed, the vulnerability exists.
        - To further confirm the vulnerability, try to access the cookie using Javascript in the browser console. For example, type `document.cookie` and check if the session cookie is listed in the output. If it is, Javascript can access the cookie, confirming the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability name: Missing Secure Flag on Session Cookie

- Description:
    1. The SecureDrop Journalist Interface uses server-side sessions and sets a session cookie.
    2. This session cookie is transmitted over HTTPS, but it is missing the `Secure` flag.
    3. Lack of `Secure` flag means the session cookie can be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections if the user were to access the site via HTTP (which should not be possible in production due to HSTS, but could occur in development/testing or misconfiguration scenarios).
    4. Although SecureDrop enforces HTTPS and HSTS, the absence of the `Secure` flag is not best practice and reduces defense-in-depth.
    5. In scenarios where HSTS is bypassed or during development, the missing `Secure` flag could allow session cookies to be transmitted over HTTP, making them susceptible to interception via network sniffing.

- Impact:
    - Medium. While HTTPS and HSTS are enforced, the missing `Secure` flag weakens defense-in-depth and could expose session cookies in specific misconfiguration or development scenarios, potentially leading to unauthorized session access.

- Vulnerability rank: Medium

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - HTTPS is enforced for all communication with the Journalist Interface, encrypting traffic and protecting cookies in transit under normal circumstances.
    - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is likely enabled to enforce HTTPS and prevent downgrade attacks in modern browsers.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement `Secure` flag for the session cookie to ensure it is only transmitted over HTTPS connections.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and needs a scenario where HTTPS and HSTS enforcement is bypassed or ineffective (e.g., during development, misconfiguration, or a sophisticated attack that circumvents HTTPS/HSTS).

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/sessions.py`
    2. Class `SessionInterface` in `save_session` method sets the session cookie.
    3. Look for `response.set_cookie` call:
    ```python
    response.set_cookie(
        app.session_cookie_name,
        session.token,
        httponly=httponly,
        domain=domain,
        path=path,
        secure=secure,
        samesite=samesite,
    )
    ```
    4. The `secure` parameter is set to `secure`, which is obtained from `self.get_cookie_secure(app)`.
    5. Inspect `FlaskSessionInterface.get_cookie_secure`:
    ```python
    def get_cookie_secure(self, app):
        return app.config.get("SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE", False)
    ```
    6. By default, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is `False` in Flask-Session.
    7. Check `app.config` in `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/__init__.py` for any explicit setting of `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`.
    8. No explicit setting of `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to `True` is found in the provided code. This means the `Secure` flag is not enabled by default.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance accessible via HTTPS.
        - Have a journalist account with valid credentials and 2FA setup.
    2. Steps:
        - Log in to the Journalist Interface using valid credentials and 2FA over HTTPS.
        - Open browser's developer tools (e.g., in Chrome, press F12).
        - Go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab.
        - In the Cookies section, find the session cookie for the Journalist Interface domain.
        - Observe the cookie details. Check if the "Secure" flag is present under the "Flags" or "Attributes" column. If "Secure" is not checked or listed, the vulnerability exists.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in error flash messages

- Description:
    1. The application uses flash messages to display feedback to the user, including error messages during login, form validation, and other operations.
    2. These flash messages are rendered in templates and may not be properly escaped before being displayed to the user.
    3. If an attacker can control the content of a flash message (e.g., through manipulating error conditions, injecting data into form fields that trigger validation errors), they might be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the flash message.
    4. When the flash message is displayed, the malicious JavaScript code could be executed in the user's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the journalist interface.

- Impact:
    - Medium. If successfully exploited, an XSS vulnerability can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, and other client-side attacks. The impact is limited to the journalist interface and depends on the attacker's ability to control flash message content.

- Vulnerability rank: Medium

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Flask uses Jinja2 templating engine, which by default escapes HTML content to prevent basic XSS attacks.
    - The code uses `escape` and `Markup` from `markupsafe` in some places, suggesting an awareness of XSS risks.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Thoroughly review all flash message rendering locations in templates to ensure proper escaping of all dynamic content, especially user-controlled inputs or data derived from user inputs that might end up in flash messages.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and execute scripts.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to find a way to influence the content of a flash message. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in form validation logic to trigger specific error messages that include attacker-controlled input.
        - Finding injection points where attacker-controlled data is directly used in flash messages without proper sanitization.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/utils.py`
    2. Function `flash_msg` renders flash messages using `render_template("flash_message.html", ...)` and `flash(Markup(msg), category)`.
    3. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/templates/flash_message.html`
    ```html
    {% set declarative_safe = declarative|default(None) %}
    {% set msg_contents_safe = msg_contents|default(None) %}

    {% if declarative_safe %}
    <p><b>{{ declarative_safe }}</b></p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if msg_contents_safe %}
    {{ msg_contents_safe }}
    {% endif %}
    ```
    4. The template uses `{{ declarative_safe }}` and `{{ msg_contents_safe }}` which, in Jinja2, means HTML escaping is applied by default.
    5. However, `Markup(msg)` in `flash_msg` could potentially bypass automatic escaping if `msg` is constructed with unescaped user input.
    6. Check instances where `flash_msg` is called, especially with user-provided data in error messages.
    7. Examples in files like `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/main.py`, `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/account.py`, `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/col.py`, `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/admin.py`.
    8. In `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/main.py`, `bulk` function, error messages use `Markup` and `escape` when flashing errors:
    ```python
    flash(
        Markup(
            "<b>{}</b> {}".format(
                escape(gettext("Nothing Selected")),
                escape(gettext("You must select one or more items for download")),
            )
        ),
        "error",
    )
    ```
    9. This use of `escape` mitigates XSS in this specific case. However, a comprehensive review is needed to ensure all flash messages, especially error messages, are properly escaped and prevent potential XSS.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance.
        - Have a journalist account.
    2. Steps:
        - Identify a form or action that generates an error flash message, and where you can control part of the error message content (e.g., login form with invalid username, form validation errors).
        - Craft a malicious input that includes JavaScript code within the expected input field. For example, for username in login form, try `<script>alert("XSS")</script>testuser`.
        - Submit the form with the malicious input to trigger the error flash message.
        - Check if the JavaScript code is executed when the flash message is displayed. If an alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.
        - Alternatively, inspect the HTML source of the page to see if the injected JavaScript code is present in the flash message content without proper escaping.

- Vulnerability name: Lack of rate limiting or brute-force protection on API token endpoint

- Description:
    1. The `/api/v1/token` endpoint in `api.py` is used to obtain an API token by providing username, passphrase, and one-time code.
    2. There is no explicit rate limiting or brute-force protection implemented for this endpoint.
    3. An attacker could repeatedly send login requests to the `/api/v1/token` endpoint with different combinations of usernames, passwords, and OTPs in an attempt to brute-force valid credentials and obtain a valid API token.
    4. While the Journalist Interface login has some throttling (LoginThrottledException), this protection is not explicitly applied to the API token endpoint.
    5. Successful brute-force attack could lead to unauthorized access to the Journalist Interface API, allowing attackers to bypass 2FA if they guess username, password and OTP.

- Impact:
    - Medium.  Lack of rate limiting increases the risk of successful brute-force attacks against journalist accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized API access and data breaches. While 2FA is in place, brute-forcing might still be feasible given enough attempts and if the OTP is predictable or reused.

- Vulnerability rank: Medium

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Journalist accounts are protected by strong passwords (diceware passphrases).
    - Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP/HOTP) is enforced for journalist accounts, making brute-force attacks significantly harder but not impossible without rate limiting.
    - Login throttling exists in the main Journalist Interface login, but it's unclear if this applies to the API token endpoint as well, and the code suggests it might not be applied to the API endpoint.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement rate limiting on the `/api/v1/token` endpoint to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a specific timeframe.
    - Consider implementing account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts to further hinder brute-force attacks.

- Preconditions:
    - The SecureDrop Journalist Interface API is exposed and accessible to attackers.
    - Attacker has a list of valid usernames or is attempting to brute-force usernames as well.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/api.py`
    2. Route `/token` in function `get_token` handles API token generation.
    3. The code calls `Journalist.login(username, passphrase, one_time_code)` for authentication.
    4. File: `/code/securedrop/models.py`
    5. Function `Journalist.login` implements login logic and raises `LoginThrottledException` if login attempts are throttled, but it's not clear if this throttling mechanism is consistently applied and effective for the API endpoint.
    6. Review the throttling mechanism in `Journalist.login` to confirm if it applies to API token requests or only to web login attempts. The code analysis suggests the throttling is tied to database records of login attempts, which *should* apply to both web and API login attempts, however, explicit rate limiting at the API endpoint level would be a stronger mitigation.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance with API enabled.
        - Have a journalist account with valid credentials and 2FA setup.
    2. Steps:
        - Use a tool like `curl` or `Burp Suite` to send multiple (e.g., hundreds or thousands) of login requests to the `/api/v1/token` endpoint in rapid succession.
        - Vary the `one_time_code` parameter in each request, but keep the username and password constant and valid.
        - Monitor the responses from the server.
        - Observe if the server starts rejecting requests after a certain number of attempts or if there is any significant delay in response times, indicating rate limiting or throttling.
        - If the server continues to process requests without any apparent rate limiting or throttling, the vulnerability exists.
        - To simulate brute-force, you can also vary usernames and passwords along with OTPs.

- Vulnerability name: Potential disclosure of source code or sensitive files via directory traversal in `download_single_file` route

- Description:
    1. The `/col/<filesystem_id>/<fn>` route in `col.py` is used to download single files (submissions, replies).
    2. The route takes `filesystem_id` and `fn` (filename) from the URL path.
    3. The code checks for directory traversal using `".." in fn or fn.startswith("/")` to prevent accessing files outside the intended storage directory.
    4. However, there might be other directory traversal techniques that are not covered by this check, or vulnerabilities might exist in how `Storage.get_default().path(filesystem_id, fn)` constructs the file path, potentially allowing an attacker to craft a malicious `fn` parameter to access arbitrary files on the server if there are flaws in path sanitization or joining within the `Storage` class or underlying OS file path handling.

- Impact:
    - Medium to High. If directory traversal is possible, an attacker could potentially download sensitive files from the server, including source code, configuration files, database backups, or even encrypted submissions from other sources if storage structure is predictable and exploitable. The impact depends on the extent of directory traversal and the sensitivity of accessible files.

- Vulnerability rank: Medium

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Basic directory traversal prevention using `".." in fn or fn.startswith("/")` check in the route handler.
    - Files are served using `send_file` with `mimetype="application/pgp-encrypted"`, which might offer some level of protection against direct execution of downloaded files, but not against information disclosure.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement more robust path sanitization and validation in the `Storage.get_default().path` method to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    - Consider using a secure file serving mechanism that restricts access to only the intended files and directories, possibly using a chroot jail or similar sandboxing techniques for file serving operations.
    - Regularly audit and update directory traversal prevention mechanisms to address new bypass techniques.

- Preconditions:
    - The Journalist Interface is accessible to attackers.
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated as a journalist to access the `/col/<filesystem_id>/<fn>` route, or an authentication bypass vulnerability exists.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/col.py`
    2. Route `/col/<filesystem_id>/<fn>` in function `download_single_file` handles file downloads.
    3. Check for directory traversal prevention:
    ```python
    if ".." in fn or fn.startswith("/"):
        abort(404)
    ```
    4. File path construction:
    ```python
    file = Storage.get_default().path(filesystem_id, fn)
    ```
    5. File: `/code/securedrop/store.py` (or wherever `Storage.get_default().path` is implemented - not provided in PROJECT FILES, assume it's in `store.py` or similar).
    6. Analyze the implementation of `Storage.get_default().path` to see how it handles `filesystem_id` and `fn` to construct the full file path. Look for any potential vulnerabilities in path joining or sanitization within the `Storage` class. If `Storage.get_default().path` simply concatenates paths without proper sanitization, directory traversal might be possible by crafting `fn` to include directory traversal sequences like `../../`.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance.
        - Have a journalist account and at least one submission in a collection.
        - Know the `filesystem_id` of the collection (can be obtained from the URL when viewing the collection).
    2. Steps:
        - Log in to the Journalist Interface.
        - Obtain a valid download URL for a submission file from the Journalist Interface.
        - Modify the `fn` parameter in the download URL to include directory traversal sequences, such as:
            - Replace `fn` with `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
            - Replace `fn` with `..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` (URL encoded)
        - Send a GET request to the modified URL (using browser or `curl`).
        - Check the response.
        - If the server returns the content of `/etc/passwd` or any other file outside the intended storage directory, directory traversal vulnerability exists.
        - If the server returns a 404 error or an error message indicating invalid file path, the basic directory traversal protection might be working, but further testing with different bypass techniques is needed.

- Vulnerability name: Potential for replay attacks in 2FA verification during admin user creation

- Description:
    1. In the admin user creation process (`admin_creates_a_user` in `journalist_app_nav.py` and `/admin/verify-2fa-totp` in `admin.py`), the 2FA token verification might not be strictly preventing replay attacks.
    2. The code in `/admin/verify-2fa-totp` (`new_user_two_factor_totp`) uses `totp.verify(token, datetime.utcnow())` for TOTP verification.
    3. `two_factor.TOTP.verify` by default allows a time window (typically +/- 30 seconds) for token validity, which is necessary for usability but also inherently allows replay attacks within that window.
    4. The comment in `account.py` for `new_two_factor_totp` explicitly states: `"Note: this intentionally doesn't prevent replay attacks, since we just want to make sure they have the right token"`. This comment is copied to `admin.py`'s `new_user_two_factor_totp`.
    5. While the intent might be just to verify the token is correct *at the time of verification*, lack of replay protection, even within a short window, could be exploited if an attacker intercepts a valid 2FA token during admin user creation process.
    6. An attacker who intercepts a valid 2FA token during admin user creation could potentially reuse that token within the validity window to gain unauthorized access, especially if the time window is longer or if there are delays in the verification process.

- Impact:
    - Low to Medium. The vulnerability is limited to a short time window and requires an attacker to intercept a valid 2FA token during admin user creation. Successful replay could lead to unauthorized admin user creation and potential privilege escalation.

- Vulnerability rank: Low

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP/HOTP) adds a significant layer of security, making it much harder to compromise accounts even with password theft.
    - Session management is server-side and session cookies are signed.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement replay attack prevention for 2FA verification during admin user creation. This could involve:
        - Using a nonce or one-time-use token mechanism to invalidate tokens after first use.
        - Implementing stricter time window validation for 2FA tokens and reducing the window if possible.
        - Consider using HOTP instead of TOTP for admin user creation, as HOTP inherently prevents replay attacks by incrementing a counter.

- Preconditions:
    - An admin is creating a new user, specifically during the 2FA verification step.
    - An attacker is able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept network traffic during the admin user creation process.
    - The attacker needs to intercept a valid 2FA token *before* it is used by the admin during the user creation process.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/admin.py`
    2. Function `new_user_two_factor_totp` handles 2FA verification during admin user creation.
    3. 2FA verification logic:
    ```python
    totp = two_factor.TOTP(otp_secret)
    try:
        totp.verify(token, datetime.utcnow())
        # ... success ...
    except two_factor.OtpTokenInvalid:
        # ... error ...
    ```
    4. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/account.py`
    5. Function `new_two_factor_totp` which has similar 2FA verification logic, and contains the comment: `"Note: this intentionally doesn't prevent replay attacks, since we just want to make sure they have the right token"`. This comment is copied into `admin.py`.
    6. The use of `two_factor.TOTP.verify(token, datetime.utcnow())` without additional replay protection confirms that replay attacks are not explicitly prevented in the code.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition:
        - Have a running SecureDrop instance.
        - Be logged in as an admin user.
        - Be in the process of creating a new journalist user and have reached the 2FA verification step.
    2. Steps:
        - During the 2FA verification step for new user creation, intercept the HTTP request containing the 2FA `token` parameter (e.g., using browser developer tools or a proxy like Burp Suite).
        - Copy the intercepted 2FA `token` value.
        - Complete the user creation process by submitting the original request with the intercepted token. User creation should succeed.
        - Immediately after successful user creation, attempt to reuse the intercepted 2FA `token` in a new request to the `/admin/verify-2fa-totp` endpoint (or by resending the original intercepted request).
        - If the server accepts the reused token and processes the request again without error, it indicates a replay attack vulnerability. If the server rejects the reused token (e.g., with an "Invalid token" error), replay attack prevention might be in place (or the replay window has expired). Repeat the test quickly after the initial successful verification to test within the typical TOTP window.
