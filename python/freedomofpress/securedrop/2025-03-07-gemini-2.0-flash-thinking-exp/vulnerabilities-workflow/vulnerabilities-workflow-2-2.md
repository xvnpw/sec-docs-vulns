- Vulnerability name: API Reply UUID Collision Vulnerability
- Description:
    1. A malicious journalist or an attacker who somehow gains access to the journalist interface can craft a reply to a source.
    2. When creating a reply through the API endpoint `/api/v1/sources/<source_uuid>/replies` (POST), the API allows specifying a `uuid` for the reply object in the request body.
    3. If an attacker provides a UUID that already exists for another reply, the system, instead of generating a new UUID, attempts to insert the reply with the attacker-provided, colliding UUID.
    4. Due to a missing check for UUID collision before insertion, this can lead to an IntegrityError in the database if the UUID already exists, but under certain race conditions or specific database states, it might be possible to overwrite or corrupt existing reply data if the uniqueness constraint is not properly enforced during concurrent requests or specific database operations.
    5. While the code attempts to handle IntegrityError and returns a 409 Conflict in case of a collision, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the API *accepts* and attempts to use a client-provided UUID without proper server-side generation or validation of uniqueness *before* database insertion, which is a deviation from secure practices. This could potentially be exploited to manipulate reply UUIDs, although a direct exploit leading to data corruption or unauthorized access to other replies is not immediately obvious from the code, further investigation would be required to assess the full impact under concurrent scenarios or specific database states.
- Impact:
    - Potential for reply data corruption or manipulation if UUID collision leads to unintended database operations.
    - Denial of service if repeated requests with colliding UUIDs cause database errors and disrupt reply creation.
    - Confusion and potential data integrity issues in the journalist interface due to inconsistent or overwritten reply data.
- Vulnerability rank: Medium
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The code attempts to catch `IntegrityError` during reply creation and returns a 409 Conflict response, preventing a complete server crash or unhandled exception.
    - UUIDs are used which are statistically unique, reducing the probability of accidental collisions in normal usage.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Server-side generation of Reply UUIDs instead of relying on client-provided values.
    - Database-level enforcement of UUID uniqueness *before* attempting insertion, to reliably prevent collisions even under race conditions.
    - Clear validation and rejection of client-provided UUIDs if the API is intended to auto-generate them server-side.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker has access to the journalist interface API, either as a legitimate journalist or through some form of API access compromise.
    - Attacker needs to know or guess an existing Reply UUID to cause a collision.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/securedrop/journalist_app/api.py`
    2. Function: `all_source_replies(source_uuid: str)` in `make_blueprint` function
    3. Code snippet:
```python
            reply_uuid = data.get("uuid", None)
            if reply_uuid is not None:
                # check that is is parseable
                try:
                    UUID(reply_uuid)
                except ValueError:
                    abort(400, "'uuid' was not a valid UUID")
                reply.uuid = reply_uuid

            try:
                db.session.add(reply)
                seen_reply = SeenReply(reply=reply, journalist=session.get_user())
                db.session.add(seen_reply)
                db.session.add(source)
                db.session.commit()
            except IntegrityError as e:
                db.session.rollback()
                if "UNIQUE constraint failed: replies.uuid" in str(e):
                    abort(409, "That UUID is already in use.")
                else:
                    raise e
```
    4. Walkthrough:
        - The code retrieves the `uuid` from the JSON request body using `data.get("uuid", None)`.
        - It checks if `reply_uuid` is not None, meaning a UUID was provided by the client.
        - It attempts to parse the provided `reply_uuid` to ensure it's a valid UUID format. If not, it aborts with a 400 error.
        - Critically, if the `reply_uuid` is valid, it's directly assigned to `reply.uuid` without checking for its uniqueness in the database.
        - When `db.session.add(reply)` and `db.session.commit()` are called, the database attempts to insert the reply with the client-provided UUID.
        - If a UUID collision occurs (due to the uniqueness constraint on `replies.uuid`), an `IntegrityError` is caught.
        - The code specifically checks for the SQLite "UNIQUE constraint failed: replies.uuid" error and aborts with a 409 Conflict if detected.
        - However, the code does not prevent the attempt to insert a reply with a client-provided UUID in the first place, and the error handling, while present, only kicks in *after* the database operation fails due to collision.

- Security test case:
    1. Precondition: Access to the journalist interface API with valid journalist credentials.
    2. Step 1: Log in to the journalist interface API and obtain a valid authentication token.
    3. Step 2: Create a source using the journalist interface (if one doesn't exist already) and obtain its `source_uuid`.
    4. Step 3: Send a POST request to `/api/v1/sources/<source_uuid>/replies` with a valid JSON payload to create an initial reply. Note the `uuid` of the created reply from the API response (or let it be auto-generated).
    5. Step 4: Send another POST request to `/api/v1/sources/<source_uuid>/replies` with a different reply message but *reuse* the `uuid` from the reply created in Step 3 in the JSON payload.
    6. Step 5: Observe the API response.
    7. Expected result: The API should return a `409 Conflict` error with a message indicating that the UUID is already in use.
    8. Step 6: (Optional - to further investigate potential race conditions or overwrite issues): Attempt to send concurrent POST requests to `/api/v1/sources/<source_uuid>/replies` with colliding UUIDs, possibly under load, and observe database behavior and data integrity. Check if, under any circumstance, data corruption or unexpected overwrites occur beyond the expected 409 responses.
