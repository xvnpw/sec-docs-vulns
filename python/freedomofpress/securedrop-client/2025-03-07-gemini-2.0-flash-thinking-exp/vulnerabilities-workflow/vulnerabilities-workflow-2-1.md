- Vulnerability Name: Path Manipulation/Traversal in SDK (CVE-2025-24888)
  - Description:
    - An attacker could potentially exploit a path manipulation vulnerability within the SecureDrop Client SDK.
    - This could be triggered by sending a maliciously crafted file to the journalist through the SecureDrop source interface.
    - When the journalist attempts to process or export this submission using the SecureDrop Client, the vulnerability in the SDK's file path handling logic is triggered.
    - This could allow the attacker to manipulate file paths in a way that leads to path traversal.
  - Impact:
    - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions.
    - This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories within the SecureDrop Workstation's Qubes OS environment.
    - In a Qubes OS environment, this could potentially compromise the confidentiality of data within the isolated VMs, if the attacker manages to read files from dom0 or other VMs, depending on the exact nature of the vulnerability.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The changelog for version 0.14.1 mentions a security fix that prevents path manipulation/traversal attacks in the SDK.
    - This fix is likely implemented within the `securedrop-sdk` component, although the specific location in the code is not provided in these PROJECT FILES.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - While a fix is mentioned as implemented in version 0.14.1, more details on the specific mitigation techniques used in the code are missing from the provided documentation.
    - It's unclear if there are additional layers of defense, such as input validation or sanitization, beyond the mentioned fix.
  - Preconditions:
    - The journalist must be logged into the SecureDrop Client.
    - The attacker must be able to submit a file to the SecureDrop instance that is processed by the vulnerable SecureDrop Client.
    - The SecureDrop Client version must be vulnerable (prior to 0.14.1).
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code for the SDK is not included in PROJECT FILES, so a detailed code analysis is not possible at this time.
    - Based on the vulnerability description (path manipulation/traversal attacks in SDK), it is likely that the vulnerability exists in code within the `securedrop-sdk` repository, specifically in modules responsible for handling file paths during file operations (e.g., file download, export, opening).
    - Further analysis of the `securedrop-sdk` codebase is needed to pinpoint the exact location and nature of the vulnerability and the implemented fix.
  - Security Test Case:
    - To validate this vulnerability, a test case would involve crafting a malicious submission file with a manipulated path designed to exploit a path traversal vulnerability in the SecureDrop Client SDK.
    - Steps for a test case would include:
      1. Set up a SecureDrop testing environment with a vulnerable version of the SecureDrop Client (prior to 0.14.1).
      2. As an attacker, submit a file to the Source Interface with a filename or content designed to trigger path traversal when processed by the client. For example, the filename could be crafted to include "../" sequences to attempt to access directories outside the intended submission directory.
      3. As a journalist, log in to the SecureDrop Client and access the source containing the malicious submission.
      4. Attempt to download, open or export the submission file.
      5. Observe if the operation results in accessing files outside the intended submission directory, which would confirm the vulnerability.
      6. Verify that in version 0.14.1 or later, this path traversal is prevented and the test case fails.
