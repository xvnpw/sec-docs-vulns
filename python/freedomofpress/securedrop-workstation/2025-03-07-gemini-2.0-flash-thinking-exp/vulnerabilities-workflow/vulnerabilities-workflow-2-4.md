### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** MIME Type Processing Vulnerability in Disposable Viewer VM

- **Description:**
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious submission file designed to exploit a vulnerability in a document viewer application (e.g., Evince, LibreOffice) within the `sd-viewer` disposable VM.
  2. The journalist downloads and attempts to view the malicious submission file using the SecureDrop Client in the `sd-app` VM.
  3. The SecureDrop Client, configured to open files in disposable VMs, correctly launches a disposable VM based on the `sd-viewer` template.
  4. Due to a vulnerability in the document viewer application within the `sd-viewer` template, processing the malicious submission file triggers the vulnerability.
  5. This vulnerability exploitation occurs within the disposable VM environment.

- **Impact:**
  - **Direct Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the `sd-viewer` disposable VM.
  - **Secondary Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability and attacker's payload, it could lead to:
    - **Compromise of Decrypted Submission Content:** The attacker could gain access to the decrypted submission data being viewed in the disposable VM.
    - **Disposable VM Escape:** The attacker might be able to escape the disposable VM sandbox and potentially gain access to the `sd-app` VM, which contains all decrypted submissions and is considered a higher-value target.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information from the decrypted submission or the disposable VM environment could be exfiltrated.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - **Disposable VMs for Document Viewing:** The SecureDrop Workstation architecture relies heavily on disposable VMs (`sd-viewer`) for opening and processing submission files. This is intended to isolate potential exploits within a short-lived, non-persistent VM, limiting the attack surface and preventing persistence on the main `sd-app` VM. This is configured through Qubes OS and SecureDrop Client settings, as seen in `test_app.py` and `test_viewer.py` which test the `open-in-dvm.desktop` configuration.
  - **AppArmor Profiles:** AppArmor profiles are enforced on document viewer applications within `sd-viewer` VM, as validated by `test_viewer.py` in `test_enforced_apparmor_profiles`. This aims to restrict the capabilities of these applications, limiting the potential damage from exploits.
  - **MIME Type Handling Service:** The `securedrop-mime-handling` service, tested in `test_viewer.py` and `test_proxy_vm.py`, is implemented to ensure that files are opened with appropriate applications within disposable VMs based on their MIME types.
  - **Mailcap Hardening:** Mailcap is hardened to prevent fallback to potentially insecure mailcap rules for application selection, as tested in `test_viewer.py`, `test_app.py`, and `test_proxy_vm.py` using `test_mailcap_hardened`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Vulnerability Scanning and Patching of Document Viewers:** While disposable VMs and AppArmor provide containment, proactive vulnerability management for document viewers (Evince, LibreOffice, Totem, etc.) within the `sd-viewer` template is crucial. Regularly scanning these applications for known vulnerabilities and applying security patches would reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation.
  - **Sandboxing within Disposable VMs:** Further sandboxing mechanisms within the disposable VMs, beyond AppArmor profiles, could be considered. Technologies like seccomp or stronger containerization within the disposable VM could add another layer of defense, making it harder for an attacker to escape the disposable VM even if a document viewer vulnerability is exploited.
  - **Input Sanitization/Strict Parsing:** Implementing stricter input sanitization and parsing within the document viewers themselves (if feasible and without breaking functionality) could help prevent certain types of exploits. However, this is a complex mitigation and might be better addressed by using inherently safer document processing libraries or applications if available.
  - **Regular TemplateVM Updates:** While the `sdw-updater` is in place to update TemplateVMs, ensuring a very aggressive update schedule for `sd-viewer` template, specifically targeting security updates for document processing software, would be a significant mitigation.

- **Preconditions:**
  1. The attacker must be able to submit a malicious file through the SecureDrop source interface.
  2. The journalist must download the malicious submission and attempt to view the file within the SecureDrop Workstation environment.
  3. A vulnerability must exist in one of the document viewer applications installed in the `sd-viewer` template VM.
  4. The malicious submission file must be crafted to successfully trigger this vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable document viewer.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File: `/code/tests/test_viewer.py` and `/code/tests/test_app.py`**
    - These test files demonstrate the project's awareness of MIME type handling and disposable VMs. They include tests for:
      - Installation of viewer packages (Evince, LibreOffice, Totem) in `sd-viewer` (`test_viewer_evince_installed`, `test_sd_viewer_libreoffice_installed`).
      - Configuration of MIME type associations to `open-in-dvm.desktop` in `sd-app` and `sd-proxy` (`test_mimeapps` in `test_app.py` and `test_proxy_vm.py`).
      - Verification that `sd-viewer` is used as the DispVM for opening files (`test_open_in_dvm_desktop` in `test_app.py` and `test_sd_devices.py`).
      - Enforcement of AppArmor profiles for viewer applications in `sd-viewer` (`test_enforced_apparmor_profiles` in `base.py` and used in `test_viewer.py`).
      - Hardening of mailcap to avoid insecure application launching (`test_mailcap_hardened` in `base.py` and used in `test_viewer.py`, `test_app.py`, `test_proxy_vm.py`, `test_sd_devices.py`).
      - Activation of `securedrop-mime-handling` service (`test_mimetypes_service` in `test_viewer.py`, `test_sd_proxy_config` and `test_sd_proxy_dvm` in `test_vms_exist.py`).
    - These tests confirm that the intended security mechanisms are in place. However, they do not prevent vulnerabilities within the document viewers themselves.

  - **File: `/code/securedrop_salt/mime-handling.sls` (Not provided in PROJECT FILES, but assumed to exist based on tests)**
    - This file (hypothetically) would contain the SaltStack configuration that sets up the MIME type handling service, configures `open-in-dvm.desktop`, and enforces AppArmor profiles. Analysis of this file (if available) would be needed to understand the specific MIME types handled, the applications configured, and the details of the AppArmor profiles.

  - **File: `/code/files/sdw-admin.py` and `/code/securedrop_salt/*.sls`**
    - These files manage the overall system provisioning and configuration, including VM creation, service setup, and applying Salt states. They are responsible for ensuring that the `sd-viewer` VM is correctly configured as a disposable VM template and that the MIME handling service is enabled.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Set up a SecureDrop Workstation environment according to the project's documentation.
     - Identify the document viewer applications installed in the `sd-viewer` template VM (e.g., Evince, LibreOffice Writer).
     - Find a known vulnerability (CVE) in one of these document viewers that can be triggered by a malicious document. For example, research recent CVEs for Evince or LibreOffice related to PDF or document processing.
  2. **Craft Malicious Submission:**
     - Create a malicious document (e.g., a specially crafted PDF or DOCX file) designed to trigger the identified CVE in the chosen document viewer. Publicly available exploit PoCs or vulnerability details can be used to craft this file.
  3. **Submit Malicious File:**
     - As an attacker, submit the crafted malicious document through the SecureDrop source interface.
  4. **Journalist Workflow:**
     - As a journalist, log into the SecureDrop Journalist Interface using the SecureDrop Client in the `sd-app` VM.
     - Download the malicious submission.
     - Attempt to view the downloaded submission file using the SecureDrop Client. This should automatically open the file in a disposable VM based on `sd-viewer`.
  5. **Observe and Verify:**
     - Monitor the `sd-viewer` disposable VM.
     - If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, observe the expected behavior based on the CVE details. This might include:
       - Unexpected application crash in `sd-viewer`.
       - Arbitrary code execution within `sd-viewer` (e.g., try to create a file in `/tmp` within the disposable VM, or attempt network communication if possible, though `sd-viewer` should be networkless).
       - If aiming for VM escape, attempt to interact with `sd-app` VM from within the exploited `sd-viewer` disposable VM (e.g., using `qvm-run` if escape is possible).
  6. **Analyze Logs:**
     - Check logs in `sd-log` VM and dom0 for any error messages, crash reports, or unusual activity related to the document viewer or disposable VM execution.

If the test case successfully demonstrates code execution or VM escape from the `sd-viewer` disposable VM after opening the malicious document, it validates the MIME Type Processing Vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights the inherent risks of relying on complex document processing software, even within sandboxed environments. Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities in document viewers and proactive patching are essential mitigations for this type of risk.
