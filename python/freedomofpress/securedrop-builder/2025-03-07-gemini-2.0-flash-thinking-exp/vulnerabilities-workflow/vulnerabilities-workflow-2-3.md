### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Git Repository Cloning in Wheel Building Process
- Description:
    1. The `build-sync-wheels` script, used to build Python wheels, clones a Git repository (e.g., `freedomofpress/securedrop-client`) from a hardcoded URL, likely `https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client`.
    2. The script proceeds to build Python wheels from the cloned repository without verifying the integrity of the cloned Git repository itself.
    3. An attacker who can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during the Git clone operation, or compromise the GitHub repository itself, could inject malicious code into the repository.
    4. The `build-sync-wheels` script would then unknowingly build wheels containing the malicious code from the compromised repository.
- Impact:
    - SecureDrop Workstation components built using these wheels would be compromised.
    - This could lead to arbitrary code execution on systems using SecureDrop Workstation, potentially compromising sensitive data and system integrity.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Dependency integrity verification using sha256 sums in `build-requirements.txt` and `poetry.lock`.
    - Tests for reproducible builds, checking for file modifications after the build process, which might detect some forms of tampering after wheel building, but not before or during cloning.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Verification of the Git repository's integrity after cloning. This could involve:
        - Verifying the Git remote URL against an expected value to prevent redirection attacks.
        - Verifying the Git commit hash against a known good commit hash (e.g., using a detached signature on a commit hash) to ensure the cloned code is from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
        - Using Git's built-in verification mechanisms (if available and configured) to ensure the integrity of the cloned repository.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker's ability to perform a MITM attack during the Git clone operation, OR
    - Attacker's ability to compromise the GitHub repository `freedomofpress/securedrop-client`.
    - Execution of `build-sync-wheels` script after the repository is compromised.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided files, specifically `utils.py`, `test_utils.py`, `test_update_requirements.py`, and `test_reproducible_wheels.py`, the project focuses on verifying the integrity of *dependencies* using sha256 sums. There is no code or test that explicitly verifies the integrity of the Git repository cloned during the wheel building process.
    - The `test_reproducible_wheels.py` test clones the repository and runs `build-sync-wheels`. However, this test only checks for modifications *after* the build process by using `git diff --exit-code` and `git status --porcelain`. It does not verify the integrity of the cloned repository at the time of cloning.
    - The absence of repository verification in the provided code and tests suggests that the `build-sync-wheels` script likely uses a standard `git clone` command without additional integrity checks, making it vulnerable to repository compromise.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup a malicious Git repository**: Create a Git repository that is a copy of `freedomofpress/securedrop-client` but contains a simple, detectable malicious change (e.g., adding a print statement in one of the Python modules that will be part of the wheel). Host this repository on a server you control, for example, using `attacker-repo.com/malicious-client`.
    2. **Modify `test_reproducible_wheels.py`**: In the `test_wheel_builds_match_version_control` test within `tests/test_reproducible_wheels.py`, temporarily change the Git clone URL from `https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client` to `https://attacker-repo.com/malicious-client`.
    3. **Run the test**: Execute the specific test using pytest: `pytest tests/test_reproducible_wheels.py::test_wheel_builds_match_version_control`.
    4. **Observe the output and artifacts**: If the vulnerability is present, the test should still pass in terms of not detecting local changes after the build (as the malicious repo is designed to be a valid project). However, the built wheels in the `wheels` directory will now be built from the malicious repository. To verify the exploit, you would need to:
        - Extract the built wheel.
        - Install the wheel in a test environment.
        - Execute the part of the code modified to include the malicious change. If the malicious change (e.g., print statement) is executed, it confirms that the wheel was indeed built from the malicious repository.
    5. **Revert the change**: After confirming the vulnerability, revert the modification in `test_reproducible_wheels.py` to use the original `freedomofpress/securedrop-client` URL to ensure future tests use the correct repository.

This test case demonstrates that if the Git repository is replaced with a malicious one (simulating a MITM attack or repository compromise), the `securedrop-builder` will build wheels from this malicious source without detecting the source code manipulation during the cloning process.
