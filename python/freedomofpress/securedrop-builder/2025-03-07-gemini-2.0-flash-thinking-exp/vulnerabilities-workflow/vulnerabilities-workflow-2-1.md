### Vulnerability List

*   #### TOCTOU vulnerability in build-requirements.txt processing

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `securedrop-builder` project uses `build-requirements.txt` to specify Python wheel dependencies for SecureDrop Workstation components.
        2.  The integrity of the `build-requirements.txt` is protected by signing the `sha256sums.txt` file, which is assumed to be related to the wheels listed in `build-requirements.txt`.
        3.  However, there is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. The signature of `sha256sums.txt` is verified, but the `build-requirements.txt` file itself is not directly signed or verified.
        4.  After the signature verification of `sha256sums.txt` (presumably in `scripts/build-sync-wheels`), and before the wheels are downloaded based on `build-requirements.txt` (also presumably in `scripts/build-sync-wheels`), an attacker with write access to the filesystem (or through a supply chain attack) could modify the `build-requirements.txt` file.
        5.  This modification could replace legitimate package requirements with malicious ones, or alter the versions to point to compromised wheels on PyPI or a malicious index.
        6.  When the `scripts/build-sync-wheels` script proceeds to download and install wheels based on the now-modified `build-requirements.txt`, it will fetch and install the attacker's chosen malicious wheels, even though the signature of `sha256sums.txt` was initially verified. The signature verification does not cover the integrity of `build-requirements.txt` at the point of use.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary malicious Python packages into the SecureDrop Workstation build process.
        *   This can lead to the distribution of compromised SecureDrop Workstation components to end-users.
        *   The attacker gains full control over the software build, potentially leading to supply chain compromise, malware injection, data exfiltration, and other severe security breaches within SecureDrop Workstation installations.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   The project uses signed `sha256sums.txt` to verify the integrity of downloaded wheels. (Mentioned in `README.md` and tested in `tests/test_update_requirements.py`).
        *   The `verify_sha256sum-signature` script is mentioned in `README.md`, suggesting signature verification is part of the process.
        *   The `test_build_fails_if_sha256_signature_absent` test in `tests/test_update_requirements.py` confirms that the tool checks for the presence of a signature.

        *However, these mitigations only address the integrity of the wheel files themselves after download and the signature of `sha256sums.txt`, but not the integrity of `build-requirements.txt` during the critical window between signature verification and wheel download.*

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Directly sign `build-requirements.txt`:** Instead of (or in addition to) signing `sha256sums.txt`, the `build-requirements.txt` file itself should be cryptographically signed. This would ensure its integrity is verified at the point of use.
        *   **Atomic Verification and Usage:** The process of verifying the dependency list and using it to download wheels should be made atomic. This could involve loading the verified dependency information into memory immediately after verification and using that in-memory representation for subsequent wheel download, instead of re-reading `build-requirements.txt` from disk.
        *   **Integrity Check at Wheel Download:**  Before downloading each wheel, the tool should re-verify the integrity of the `build-requirements.txt` or the in-memory representation to ensure it hasn't been tampered with since the initial signature verification.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   Attacker needs to be able to modify files in the filesystem after the `sha256sums.txt` signature is verified but before wheels are downloaded based on `build-requirements.txt`. This could be achieved through:
            *   Compromising the build environment itself.
            *   Supply chain attack targeting the infrastructure where `securedrop-builder` is executed.
            *   If the build process involves multiple stages or scripts with intermediate file system operations, a vulnerability in process separation could also allow for manipulation.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        *   Due to the project files provided not containing the scripts `scripts/build-sync-wheels` and `scripts/update-requirements`, a complete code walkthrough is not possible. However, based on the file names, `README.md`, and test files, we can infer the following vulnerable workflow:
            1.  **`scripts/update-requirements` (inferred functionality):**
                *   Generates `build-requirements.txt` based on `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.
                *   Generates `sha256sums.txt` containing checksums of wheels (and possibly sources).
                *   Signs `sha256sums.txt` to create `sha256sums.txt.asc`.
            2.  **`scripts/build-sync-wheels` (inferred vulnerable functionality):**
                *   Verifies the signature of `sha256sums.txt.asc` using `scripts/verify-sha256sum-signature` or similar logic. (Test `test_build_fails_if_sha256_signature_absent` suggests this verification).
                *   **Vulnerable Point:** After successful signature verification of `sha256sums.txt`, the script proceeds to read and parse `build-requirements.txt` to determine the wheels to download and install.
                *   If an attacker modifies `build-requirements.txt` *after* the signature check of `sha256sums.txt.asc` but *before* `scripts/build-sync-wheels` uses `build-requirements.txt` to download wheels, the script will use the attacker-modified file.
                *   The script then downloads and installs wheels based on the potentially malicious `build-requirements.txt`.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:** Prepare a test environment mirroring the SecureDrop build process as closely as possible. This would ideally involve setting up a local instance of `securedrop-builder` and a mock package index.
        2.  **Initial State:** Ensure the `build-requirements.txt` and `sha256sums.txt.asc` are correctly generated and signed by a legitimate key.
        3.  **Verification Point:** Locate or infer the point in `scripts/build-sync-wheels` where the `sha256sums.txt.asc` signature is verified.
        4.  **Attack Simulation:** Introduce a pause or hook *after* the signature verification step in `scripts/build-sync-wheels` but *before* it reads `build-requirements.txt` to download wheels. During this pause, replace the legitimate `build-requirements.txt` with a malicious version. The malicious `build-requirements.txt` should specify a known malicious package (e.g., a package that simply prints a message to stdout or creates a file in `/tmp` as proof of execution) instead of a legitimate dependency.
        5.  **Execution:** Continue the `scripts/build-sync-wheels` script execution.
        6.  **Verification:**
            *   Check if the malicious package specified in the modified `build-requirements.txt` is installed.
            *   Observe the output or side-effects of the malicious package (e.g., the message printed to stdout, the file created in `/tmp`).
            *   Verify that the build process proceeds without signature errors, despite the injected malicious dependency.
        7.  **Expected Result:** The test should demonstrate that even though the signature of `sha256sums.txt.asc` was verified, the build process installs the malicious package due to the modification of `build-requirements.txt` after signature verification, confirming the TOCTOU vulnerability.
