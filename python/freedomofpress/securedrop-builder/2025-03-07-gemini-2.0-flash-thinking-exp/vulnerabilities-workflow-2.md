### Combined Vulnerability List

*   #### TOCTOU vulnerability in build-requirements.txt processing

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `securedrop-builder` project uses `build-requirements.txt` to specify Python wheel dependencies for SecureDrop Workstation components.
        2.  The integrity of the `build-requirements.txt` is protected by signing the `sha256sums.txt` file, which is assumed to be related to the wheels listed in `build-requirements.txt`.
        3.  However, there is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. The signature of `sha256sums.txt` is verified, but the `build-requirements.txt` file itself is not directly signed or verified.
        4.  After the signature verification of `sha256sums.txt` (presumably in `scripts/build-sync-wheels`), and before the wheels are downloaded based on `build-requirements.txt` (also presumably in `scripts/build-sync-wheels`), an attacker with write access to the filesystem (or through a supply chain attack) could modify the `build-requirements.txt` file.
        5.  This modification could replace legitimate package requirements with malicious ones, or alter the versions to point to compromised wheels on PyPI or a malicious index.
        6.  When the `scripts/build-sync-wheels` script proceeds to download and install wheels based on the now-modified `build-requirements.txt`, it will fetch and install the attacker's chosen malicious wheels, even though the signature of `sha256sums.txt` was initially verified. The signature verification does not cover the integrity of `build-requirements.txt` at the point of use.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary malicious Python packages into the SecureDrop Workstation build process.
        *   This can lead to the distribution of compromised SecureDrop Workstation components to end-users.
        *   The attacker gains full control over the software build, potentially leading to supply chain compromise, malware injection, data exfiltration, and other severe security breaches within SecureDrop Workstation installations.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   The project uses signed `sha256sums.txt` to verify the integrity of downloaded wheels. (Mentioned in `README.md` and tested in `tests/test_update_requirements.py`).
        *   The `verify_sha256sum-signature` script is mentioned in `README.md`, suggesting signature verification is part of the process.
        *   The `test_build_fails_if_sha256_signature_absent` test in `tests/test_update_requirements.py` confirms that the tool checks for the presence of a signature.

        *However, these mitigations only address the integrity of the wheel files themselves after download and the signature of `sha256sums.txt`, but not the integrity of `build-requirements.txt` during the critical window between signature verification and wheel download.*

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Directly sign `build-requirements.txt`:** Instead of (or in addition to) signing `sha256sums.txt`, the `build-requirements.txt` file itself should be cryptographically signed. This would ensure its integrity is verified at the point of use.
        *   **Atomic Verification and Usage:** The process of verifying the dependency list and using it to download wheels should be made atomic. This could involve loading the verified dependency information into memory immediately after verification and using that in-memory representation for subsequent wheel download, instead of re-reading `build-requirements.txt` from disk.
        *   **Integrity Check at Wheel Download:**  Before downloading each wheel, the tool should re-verify the integrity of the `build-requirements.txt` or the in-memory representation to ensure it hasn't been tampered with since the initial signature verification.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   Attacker needs to be able to modify files in the filesystem after the `sha256sums.txt` signature is verified but before wheels are downloaded based on `build-requirements.txt`. This could be achieved through:
            *   Compromising the build environment itself.
            *   Supply chain attack targeting the infrastructure where `securedrop-builder` is executed.
            *   If the build process involves multiple stages or scripts with intermediate file system operations, a vulnerability in process separation could also allow for manipulation.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        *   Due to the project files provided not containing the scripts `scripts/build-sync-wheels` and `scripts/update-requirements`, a complete code walkthrough is not possible. However, based on the file names, `README.md`, and test files, we can infer the following vulnerable workflow:
            1.  **`scripts/update-requirements` (inferred functionality):**
                *   Generates `build-requirements.txt` based on `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.
                *   Generates `sha256sums.txt` containing checksums of wheels (and possibly sources).
                *   Signs `sha256sums.txt` to create `sha256sums.txt.asc`.
            2.  **`scripts/build-sync-wheels` (inferred vulnerable functionality):**
                *   Verifies the signature of `sha256sums.txt.asc` using `scripts/verify-sha256sum-signature` or similar logic. (Test `test_build_fails_if_sha256_signature_absent` suggests this verification).
                *   **Vulnerable Point:** After successful signature verification of `sha256sums.txt`, the script proceeds to read and parse `build-requirements.txt` to determine the wheels to download and install.
                *   If an attacker modifies `build-requirements.txt` *after* the signature check of `sha256sums.txt.asc` but *before* `scripts/build-sync-wheels` uses `build-requirements.txt` to download wheels, the script will use the attacker-modified file.
                *   The script then downloads and installs wheels based on the potentially malicious `build-requirements.txt`.

        *   **Visualization of Vulnerable Workflow:**

        ```

        ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:** Prepare a test environment mirroring the SecureDrop build process as closely as possible. This would ideally involve setting up a local instance of `securedrop-builder` and a mock package index.
        2.  **Initial State:** Ensure the `build-requirements.txt` and `sha256sums.txt.asc` are correctly generated and signed by a legitimate key.
        3.  **Verification Point:** Locate or infer the point in `scripts/build-sync-wheels` where the `sha256sums.txt.asc` signature is verified.
        4.  **Attack Simulation:** Introduce a pause or hook *after* the signature verification step in `scripts/build-sync-wheels` but *before* it reads `build-requirements.txt` to download wheels. During this pause, replace the legitimate `build-requirements.txt` with a malicious version. The malicious `build-requirements.txt` should specify a known malicious package (e.g., a package that simply prints a message to stdout or creates a file in `/tmp` as proof of execution) instead of a legitimate dependency.
        5.  **Execution:** Continue the `scripts/build-sync-wheels` script execution.
        6.  **Verification:**
            *   Check if the malicious package specified in the modified `build-requirements.txt` is installed.
            *   Observe the output or side-effects of the malicious package (e.g., the message printed to stdout, the file created in `/tmp`).
            *   Verify that the build process proceeds without signature errors, despite the injected malicious dependency.
        7.  **Expected Result:** The test should demonstrate that even though the signature of `sha256sums.txt.asc` was verified, the build process installs the malicious package due to the modification of `build-requirements.txt` after signature verification, confirming the TOCTOU vulnerability.

*   #### Potential Command Injection in `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` via `PKG_DIR` or `--pkg-dir`

    *   **Description:**
        An attacker might be able to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `PKG_DIR` environment variable or the `--pkg-dir` command-line argument passed to the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` scripts. If these scripts use these parameters in a way that is vulnerable to command injection (e.g., in `subprocess.call` or `os.system` without proper sanitization), an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the build system.

        Step by step to trigger:
        1. Identify a scenario where the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` scripts are executed and accept user-controlled input for `PKG_DIR` or `--pkg-dir`. This could be through environment variables or command-line arguments during a build process.
        2. Set the `PKG_DIR` environment variable or provide `--pkg-dir` argument with a malicious value containing shell commands. For example: `--pkg-dir '`/tmp/pwned`' or `PKG_DIR='$(touch /tmp/pwned)'`.
        3. Execute the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` script.
        4. If the scripts are vulnerable, the commands injected through `PKG_DIR` or `--pkg-dir` will be executed on the build system.

    *   **Impact:**
        Arbitrary code execution on the build system. This could lead to complete compromise of the build environment, allowing the attacker to:
        - Modify build artifacts, potentially injecting malware into the SecureDrop Workstation components.
        - Steal secrets, such as signing keys or access credentials used in the build process.
        - Disrupt the build process, leading to supply chain attacks or denial of service.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None apparent from the provided files. The tests focus on functional correctness, reproducibility, and hash verification but do not include explicit input sanitization or security checks for parameters like `PKG_DIR` or `--pkg-dir`.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Input sanitization for `PKG_DIR` and `--pkg-dir` parameters in the `build-sync-wheels` and `update-requirements` scripts.
        - Implementation of secure coding practices to avoid command injection vulnerabilities, such as using `subprocess` with argument lists instead of shell=True and ensuring proper escaping or sanitization of user-provided inputs.
        - Code review specifically focused on identifying and mitigating command injection vulnerabilities in the build scripts.
        - Security testing, including fuzzing and manual penetration testing, to verify the absence of command injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `PKG_DIR` environment variable or the `--pkg-dir` command-line argument when the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` scripts are executed.
        - This might be possible in scenarios where:
            - The build process is triggered by external events or user input that can control environment variables or command-line arguments.
            - There are other vulnerabilities in the system that allow an attacker to manipulate the build environment or parameters.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        (Due to the absence of `build-sync-wheels` and `update-requirements` script code in the provided files, a detailed source code analysis is not possible. The following analysis is based on assumptions about how these scripts might be implemented based on common practices and the project description.)

        Assuming the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` scripts use the `PKG_DIR` or `--pkg-dir` parameters in a subprocess call to change the working directory or execute commands within the specified directory, a vulnerable code pattern might look like this (pseudocode):

        ```python
        import subprocess
        import os

        def build_wheels(pkg_dir):
            # ... some processing ...
            command = f"cd {pkg_dir} && some_build_command" # Vulnerable: pkg_dir is directly embedded in shell command
            subprocess.check_call(command, shell=True) # shell=True is dangerous here
            # ... more processing ...

        # Example usage (potentially from command-line argument parsing)
        pkg_dir = os.environ.get("PKG_DIR") # or parsed from --pkg-dir argument
        build_wheels(pkg_dir)
        ```

        In this example, if `pkg_dir` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious value. For instance, setting `PKG_DIR` to `"; malicious_command; "` would result in the execution of `cd ; malicious_command;  && some_build_command` in the shell, leading to command injection.

        Visualization:

        ```
        User Input (PKG_DIR or --pkg-dir) --> Script Parameter --> Unsanitized String Interpolation --> subprocess.check_call(..., shell=True) --> Command Execution
        ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        (Hypothetical test case, as the script code is not available. This test case demonstrates how a potential command injection vulnerability could be verified if the scripts were available for testing.)

        1. Set up a test environment where you can execute the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` scripts.
        2. Prepare a malicious payload for the `PKG_DIR` environment variable. For example, to test for command injection, set `PKG_DIR` to `"; touch /tmp/pwned_builder_vuln; "`. This payload attempts to create a file named `pwned_builder_vuln` in the `/tmp` directory.
        3. Execute the `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements` script in the test environment, ensuring that the malicious `PKG_DIR` environment variable is in effect. For example:
           ```shell
           export PKG_DIR='"; touch /tmp/pwned_builder_vuln; "'
           ./scripts/build-sync-wheels --pkg-dir /path/to/some/pkg --project test-project # Or relevant script and parameters
           ```
        4. After script execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_builder_vuln` exists.
        5. If the file `/tmp/pwned_builder_vuln` is created, it confirms that the command injected through the `PKG_DIR` environment variable was successfully executed, indicating a command injection vulnerability.

*   #### Unverified Git Repository Cloning in Wheel Building Process

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The `build-sync-wheels` script, used to build Python wheels, clones a Git repository (e.g., `freedomofpress/securedrop-client`) from a hardcoded URL, likely `https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client`.
        2.  The script proceeds to build Python wheels from the cloned repository without verifying the integrity of the cloned Git repository itself.
        3.  An attacker who can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during the Git clone operation, or compromise the GitHub repository itself, could inject malicious code into the repository.
        4.  The `build-sync-wheels` script would then unknowingly build wheels containing the malicious code from the compromised repository.

    *   **Impact:**
        - SecureDrop Workstation components built using these wheels would be compromised.
        - This could lead to arbitrary code execution on systems using SecureDrop Workstation, potentially compromising sensitive data and system integrity.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - Dependency integrity verification using sha256 sums in `build-requirements.txt` and `poetry.lock`.
        - Tests for reproducible builds, checking for file modifications after the build process, which might detect some forms of tampering after wheel building, but not before or during cloning.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Verification of the Git repository's integrity after cloning. This could involve:
            - Verifying the Git remote URL against an expected value to prevent redirection attacks.
            - Verifying the Git commit hash against a known good commit hash (e.g., using a detached signature on a commit hash) to ensure the cloned code is from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
            - Using Git's built-in verification mechanisms (if available and configured) to ensure the integrity of the cloned repository.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - Attacker's ability to perform a MITM attack during the Git clone operation, OR
        - Attacker's ability to compromise the GitHub repository `freedomofpress/securedrop-client`.
        - Execution of `build-sync-wheels` script after the repository is compromised.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        - Based on the provided files, specifically `utils.py`, `test_utils.py`, `test_update_requirements.py`, and `test_reproducible_wheels.py`, the project focuses on verifying the integrity of *dependencies* using sha256 sums. There is no code or test that explicitly verifies the integrity of the Git repository cloned during the wheel building process.
        - The `test_reproducible_wheels.py` test clones the repository and runs `build-sync-wheels`. However, this test only checks for modifications *after* the build process by using `git diff --exit-code` and `git status --porcelain`. It does not verify the integrity of the cloned repository at the time of cloning.
        - The absence of repository verification in the provided code and tests suggests that the `build-sync-wheels` script likely uses a standard `git clone` command without additional integrity checks, making it vulnerable to repository compromise.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup a malicious Git repository**: Create a Git repository that is a copy of `freedomofpress/securedrop-client` but contains a simple, detectable malicious change (e.g., adding a print statement in one of the Python modules that will be part of the wheel). Host this repository on a server you control, for example, using `attacker-repo.com/malicious-client`.
        2.  **Modify `test_reproducible_wheels.py`**: In the `test_wheel_builds_match_version_control` test within `tests/test_reproducible_wheels.py`, temporarily change the Git clone URL from `https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client` to `https://attacker-repo.com/malicious-client`.
        3.  **Run the test**: Execute the specific test using pytest: `pytest tests/test_reproducible_wheels.py::test_wheel_builds_match_version_control`.
        4.  **Observe the output and artifacts**: If the vulnerability is present, the test should still pass in terms of not detecting local changes after the build (as the malicious repo is designed to be a valid project). However, the built wheels in the `wheels` directory will now be built from the malicious repository. To verify the exploit, you would need to:
            - Extract the built wheel.
            - Install the wheel in a test environment.
            - Execute the part of the code modified to include the malicious change. If the malicious change (e.g., print statement) is executed, it confirms that the wheel was indeed built from the malicious repository.
        5.  **Revert the change**: After confirming the vulnerability, revert the modification in `test_reproducible_wheels.py` to use the original `freedomofpress/securedrop-client` URL to ensure future tests use the correct repository.

        This test case demonstrates that if the Git repository is replaced with a malicious one (simulating a MITM attack or repository compromise), the `securedrop-builder` will build wheels from this malicious source without detecting the source code manipulation during the cloning process.

*   #### Supply Chain Compromise via Malicious Code Injection in Wheels

    *   **Description:**
        An attacker could potentially compromise the `securedrop-builder` scripts (such as `build-sync-wheels` or `update-requirements`) or the dependencies used during the build process. By doing so, they could inject malicious code into the generated Python wheels for SecureDrop Workstation components. This could occur if a developer is socially engineered into using a compromised version of `securedrop-builder`.

        **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker compromises the `securedrop-builder` repository or gains access to a developer's environment where `securedrop-builder` is used.
        2. The attacker modifies one of the critical scripts, for example, `scripts/build-sync-wheels`, to include malicious code injection logic. This logic could be designed to append malicious code to Python files within the generated wheels during the build process.
        3. A developer, unaware of the compromise, uses the infected `securedrop-builder` to build Python wheels for SecureDrop Workstation components, following the standard procedures outlined in the README.
        4. The `build-sync-wheels` script, now containing the attacker's malicious code, executes and generates Python wheels that are backdoored.
        5. These compromised wheels are then potentially used to build and deploy SecureDrop Workstation components, thus infecting the SecureDrop ecosystem.

    *   **Impact:**
        Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a critical compromise of SecureDrop Workstation components. Backdoored wheels could allow the attacker to:
        - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data handled by SecureDrop Workstation.
        - Execute arbitrary code on systems running SecureDrop Workstation.
        - Disrupt the normal operation of SecureDrop Workstation.
        - Potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire SecureDrop system.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - **Verification of sha256sums for dependencies:** The `securedrop-builder` uses sha256 sums to verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies, as indicated in the README and tested in `tests/test_update_requirements.py`. This helps ensure that fetched dependencies from PyPI are not tampered with during download.
        - **Signing of `sha256sums.txt`:** The `sha256sums.txt` file, which lists the sha256 sums of the wheels, is signed using GPG. This is mentioned in the README and aims to provide a way to verify the integrity of the checksum list itself.
        - **Reproducible builds:** The project aims to create reproducible builds, which in theory makes it easier to detect unintended changes in the build outputs. The tests in `tests/test_reproducible_wheels.py` check for unexpected changes in the git repository after building wheels, indicating a focus on build reproducibility.
        - **Code review and CI:** The project uses GitHub and CircleCI, implying that code changes are subject to review and are tested in a CI environment. This process can help in catching unintentional or malicious changes to the codebase.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Integrity checks for `securedrop-builder` scripts:** There are no explicit mechanisms in place to verify the integrity of the `securedrop-builder` scripts themselves before execution. An attacker compromising the scripts directly could bypass the dependency integrity checks.
        - **Stronger verification of the build environment:** The security of the environment where `securedrop-builder` is executed is not explicitly addressed. If the build environment is compromised, the entire build process becomes vulnerable.
        - **Supply chain security best practices:** Implementing more robust supply chain security measures, such as using a trusted build service, dependency scanning, and software bill of materials (SBOM), could further reduce the risk.
        - **Limited scope of reproducibility tests:** While tests check for git diffs after wheel building, they might not detect subtle code injections within the wheels if the changes don't result in file modifications tracked by git or if the changes are cleverly concealed.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        - The attacker needs to compromise either:
            - The `securedrop-builder` repository (e.g., via compromised developer account, vulnerability in GitHub).
            - A developer's local environment where `securedrop-builder` is used (e.g., via malware, social engineering).
        - A developer must then use the compromised `securedrop-builder` to build wheels for SecureDrop Workstation components.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        - **`scripts/build-sync-wheels`:** This script is central to the wheel building process. If an attacker modifies this script, they can inject arbitrary code during the wheel creation. For example, they could modify the script to append malicious Python code to the `__init__.py` file of any package being built. The script does not have any built-in integrity checks for itself.
        - **`scripts/update-requirements`:** This script manages the `build-requirements.txt` file. While it verifies sha256 sums of dependencies, it does not verify the integrity of the scripts involved in updating these requirements. A compromised `update-requirements` script could be used to introduce malicious dependencies or manipulate the requirements in a way that facilitates code injection.
        - **`scripts/utils.py`:** This utility script is used by other scripts. If compromised, it could affect the behavior of multiple scripts, potentially creating vulnerabilities across the build process. For instance, if `get_poetry_hashes` or `get_requirements_hashes` is modified to return incorrect hashes, dependency verification could be bypassed.
        - **Test Limitations:** The existing tests in `tests/` primarily focus on functional correctness (e.g., ensuring sha256 sum verification works, builds are reproducible in terms of git diffs). They do not include specific tests to detect or prevent malicious code injection into the build process or the scripts themselves. The reproducibility tests in `test_reproducible_wheels.py` only check for git diffs, which may not catch all forms of malicious injection, especially if the attacker is careful to avoid changing tracked files or introduces subtle modifications within the wheel building process itself.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Set up a test environment:** Clone the `securedrop-builder` repository to a local machine.
        2.  **Modify `build-sync-wheels` script for malicious injection:**
            - Open the `scripts/build-sync-wheels` file.
            - Add the following lines at the end of the `build_wheels_for_project` function, just before the `return` statement. This code will inject a simple backdoor into the `__init__.py` file of the first package being built.
            ```python
            import os
            import glob

            wheel_dir = Path(pkg_dir) / "wheels"
            init_files = glob.glob(str(wheel_dir / "**/*/__init__.py"), recursive=True)
            if init_files:
                target_init_file = init_files[0] # Just target the first package for simplicity
                with open(target_init_file, "a") as f:
                    f.write("\n# Malicious code injected by compromised build script\n")
                    f.write("def backdoor():\n")
                    f.write("    import os\n")
                    f.write("    os.system('touch /tmp/backdoor_activated')\n") # Simulate malicious activity
                    f.write("backdoor()\n")
            ```
        3.  **Run `build-sync-wheels`:** Execute the `build-sync-wheels` script for the `workstation-bootstrap` project:
            ```bash
            ./scripts/build-sync-wheels --pkg-dir ./workstation-bootstrap --project workstation-bootstrap --clobber
            ```
        4.  **Inspect the generated wheels:**
            - Navigate to the `workstation-bootstrap/wheels` directory.
            - Extract the first generated wheel file (e.g., using `unzip <wheel_file>.whl -d extracted_wheel`).
            - Inspect the `__init__.py` file within the extracted wheel's directory structure (e.g., `extracted_wheel/<package_name>/__init__.py`).
            - Verify that the malicious code (lines starting with `# Malicious code injected...` and `def backdoor()...`) is present at the end of the `__init__.py` file.
        5.  **Check for side effect (backdoor activation):**
            - Check if the file `/tmp/backdoor_activated` exists. If it does, the backdoor code was executed when the compromised wheel was installed (simulating a real-world scenario where the wheel is installed as part of SecureDrop Workstation).

        If the malicious code is found in the `__init__.py` file and `/tmp/backdoor_activated` exists, it confirms that an attacker can inject malicious code into the generated wheels by compromising the `build-sync-wheels` script, demonstrating the supply chain vulnerability.
