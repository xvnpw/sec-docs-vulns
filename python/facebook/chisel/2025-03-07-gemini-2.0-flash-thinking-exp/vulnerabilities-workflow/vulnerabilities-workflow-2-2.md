### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Commands
* Description:
    1. A developer installs Chisel and configures their `~/.lldbinit` file to load Chisel commands as described in the installation instructions.
    2. An attacker creates a malicious Python script containing a Chisel command (or modifies an existing command).
    3. The attacker socially engineers a developer into adding a line to their `~/.lldbinit` file that loads this malicious script. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques, such as:
        - Convincing the developer to install a "helpful" Chisel extension from an untrusted source.
        - Tricking the developer into copying a malicious configuration snippet from a compromised website or forum.
        - Embedding the malicious configuration in a seemingly harmless tutorial or blog post about iOS debugging.
    4. The developer adds the malicious line to their `~/.lldbinit` file, which instructs Chisel to load commands from a directory controlled by the attacker or containing the attacker's malicious command script.
    5. The next time the developer starts Xcode and LLDB, or sources their `.lldbinit` file, LLDB executes the `fbchisellldb.py` script.
    6. The `fbchisellldb.py` script, through the `loadCommandsInDirectory` function, loads and executes the malicious Python script from the attacker-specified location.
    7. The malicious code within the script is executed within the context of the developer's LLDB session, granting the attacker arbitrary code execution within the developer's environment.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine with the privileges of the developer running LLDB and Xcode.
    - Potential for sensitive data exfiltration from the developer's machine, including source code, credentials, and debugging information.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors on the developer's system.
    - Modification of project files or other sensitive data accessible to the developer.
    - Compromise of the developer's development environment and potentially further systems if the developer has access to internal networks or resources.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project code does not implement any mitigations against loading and executing arbitrary custom commands.
    - The `README.md` provides instructions on how to load custom commands but does not include any security warnings about the risks of loading untrusted code into `.lldbinit`.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Security Warning in `README.md`: A prominent warning should be added to the "Custom Commands" section of the `README.md` file, explicitly stating the security risks associated with loading custom commands from untrusted sources. This warning should advise developers to only load custom commands from sources they fully trust and understand.
    - Input Validation (Limited Applicability): While full input validation of directory paths might be overly restrictive and hinder the intended functionality of custom commands, basic checks could be considered. However, the primary mitigation should be developer awareness and caution.
    - Code Signing (Limited Effectiveness): Code signing Chisel itself would not prevent the loading of external, malicious Python scripts via the custom commands mechanism.

* Preconditions:
    - Developer has installed Chisel.
    - Developer has configured their `~/.lldbinit` file to load Chisel.
    - Attacker successfully socially engineers the developer into adding a malicious `command script import` or `script fbobjclldb.loadCommandsInDirectory` line to their `~/.lldbinit` file, pointing to a malicious Python script or directory.
    - Developer restarts Xcode/LLDB or sources their `.lldbinit` file after adding the malicious configuration.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/fbchisellldb.py`
    - Function: `loadCommandsInDirectory(commandsDirectory)`
    ```python
    def loadCommandsInDirectory(commandsDirectory):
        for file in os.listdir(commandsDirectory):
            fileName, fileExtension = os.path.splitext(file)
            if fileExtension == ".py":
                module = imp.load_source(fileName, os.path.join(commandsDirectory, file)) # [CRITICAL]: Loads Python module from file path
                if hasattr(module, "lldbinit"):
                    module.lldbinit() # [CRITICAL]: Executes lldbinit function if exists
                if hasattr(module, "lldbcommands"):
                    module._loadedFunctions = {}
                    for command in module.lldbcommands(): # [CRITICAL]: Iterates through commands defined in module
                        loadCommand(
                            module, command, commandsDirectory, fileName, fileExtension
                        )
    ```
    - The `loadCommandsInDirectory` function is the entry point for loading custom commands.
    - `os.listdir(commandsDirectory)`: Retrieves a list of files and directories within the provided `commandsDirectory`.
    - `imp.load_source(fileName, os.path.join(commandsDirectory, file))`: This line is the core of the vulnerability. It dynamically loads a Python module from the file path constructed from `commandsDirectory` and each file found within it (if the extension is `.py`). This allows execution of arbitrary Python code if a malicious script is placed in the loaded directory.
    - `module.lldbinit()` and `module.lldbcommands()`: If the loaded module defines these functions, they are executed, further enabling arbitrary actions within the LLDB environment.
    - Function: `loadCommand(module, command, directory, filename, extension)`
    ```python
    def loadCommand(module, command, directory, filename, extension):
        func = makeRunCommand(command, os.path.join(directory, filename + extension)) # Wraps command's run method
        name = command.name()
        helpText = command.description().strip().splitlines()[0] # Extracts help text
        key = filename + "_" + name
        module._loadedFunctions[key] = func
        functionName = "__" + key
        lldb.debugger.HandleCommand( # [CRITICAL]: Registers a new LLDB command
            "script "
            + functionName
            + " = sys.modules['"
            + module.__name__
            + "']._loadedFunctions['"
            + key
            + "']"
        )
        lldb.debugger.HandleCommand( # [CRITICAL]: Adds LLDB command with help and function
            'command script add --help "{help}" --function {function} {name}'.format(
                help=helpText.replace('"', '\\"'),  # escape quotes
                function=functionName,
                name=name,
            )
        )
    ```
    - `loadCommand` registers each custom command with LLDB, making them available for execution within the debugger.
    - `lldb.debugger.HandleCommand('command script add ...')`: This LLDB API is used to register the custom command, linking it to the Python `runCommand` function, which ultimately executes the `run` method of the custom command class.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a directory named `malicious_commands` in your home directory: `mkdir ~/malicious_commands`
    2. Create a file named `malicious_command.py` inside `malicious_commands` directory with the following content:
    ```python
    import fbchisellldbbase as fb
    import os

    def lldbcommands():
      return [ MaliciousCommand() ]

    class MaliciousCommand(fb.FBCommand):
      def name(self):
        return 'evilcmd'

      def description(self):
        return 'This is a malicious command that creates a file in /tmp.'

      def run(self, arguments, options):
        os.system('touch /tmp/evil_chisel_command_executed')
        print("Malicious command executed and file created in /tmp")
    ```
    3. Open your `~/.lldbinit` file (create it if it doesn't exist: `touch ~/.lldbinit; open ~/.lldbinit`).
    4. Add the following lines to your `~/.lldbinit` file:
    ```python
    command script import /path/to/fbchisellldb.py # Replace with the actual path to fbchisellldb.py if needed
    script fbobjclldb.loadCommandsInDirectory('/Users/$USER/malicious_commands/') # Replace $USER with your username
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `/path/to/fbchisellldb.py` with the correct path to `fbchisellldb.py` if necessary. Replace `$USER` with your actual username in the second line.
    5. Save the `~/.lldbinit` file.
    6. Start Xcode and run any iOS project in the debugger. Alternatively, if Xcode is already running, either restart it or execute `command source ~/.lldbinit` in the LLDB console.
    7. In the LLDB console, type `help evilcmd` to verify the malicious command is loaded.
    8. Execute the malicious command by typing `evilcmd` in the LLDB console.
    9. Check if the file `/tmp/evil_chisel_command_executed` has been created: `ls /tmp/evil_chisel_command_executed`. If the file exists, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    10. Remove the malicious line from your `~/.lldbinit` file and delete the `malicious_commands` directory and `evil_chisel_command_executed` file to clean up your system.
