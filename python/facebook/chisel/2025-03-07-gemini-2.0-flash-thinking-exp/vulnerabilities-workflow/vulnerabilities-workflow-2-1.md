- Vulnerability Name: Unverified Installation and Load of Code Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. A developer follows the Chisel installation instructions, which involve downloading Chisel and adding a line to their `~/.lldbinit` file to import the `fbchisellldb.py` script.
    2. An attacker creates a malicious version of Chisel, containing backdoored `fbchisellldb.py` or other components.
    3. The attacker tricks the developer into installing this malicious version of Chisel. This could be done through various means, such as:
        - Hosting the malicious Chisel on a website that appears legitimate or is easily mistaken for the official source.
        - Performing a man-in-the-middle attack during download if the developer is downloading Chisel over an unencrypted connection.
        - Social engineering tactics to convince the developer to download and install the malicious version.
    4. The developer, unknowingly, installs the malicious Chisel onto their system.
    5. When the developer starts Xcode and begins debugging an iOS application, LLDB is initialized and executes the commands in `~/.lldbinit`.
    6. The `command script import /path/to/fbchisellldb.py` line in `.lldbinit` causes LLDB to load and execute the malicious `fbchisellldb.py` script from the attacker-controlled Chisel installation.
    7. The malicious code within `fbchisellldb.py` (or any other malicious component loaded by it) executes with the privileges of the developer user, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. This can have severe consequences, including:
    - Data theft: The attacker can steal sensitive information, such as source code, certificates, private keys, and credentials stored on the developer's machine.
    - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware, ransomware, or other malicious software on the developer's system.
    - Supply chain compromise: If the developer's machine is compromised, it could be used as a stepping stone to further attacks, potentially compromising the software development and distribution pipeline.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided project files do not include any mechanisms for verifying the integrity or authenticity of the Chisel installation. The installation instructions in `README.md` rely on external package managers like Homebrew, which may offer some level of integrity but are not part of the Chisel project itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Code Signing: Signing the Chisel Python scripts with a digital signature would allow developers to verify that the code originates from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
    - Checksum Verification: Providing checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of the official Chisel release files would enable developers to verify the integrity of downloaded files before installation. These checksums should be published on a trusted channel (e.g., the official Chisel GitHub repository).
    - Secure Installation Instructions: The installation documentation should strongly emphasize the importance of downloading Chisel only from trusted sources, such as the official GitHub releases or reputable package managers like Homebrew. It should also advise developers to verify the integrity of downloaded files using provided checksums if manual installation is performed.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully trick a developer into installing a malicious version of Chisel.
    - The developer must have followed the installation instructions for Chisel and configured their `~/.lldbinit` file to import `fbchisellldb.py`.
    - The developer must start Xcode and initiate a debugging session, which triggers LLDB to load and execute the scripts from `.lldbinit`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/README.md`: The `Installation` section instructs users to download and install Chisel and then modify their `~/.lldbinit` file to load `fbchisellldb.py` using `command script import`. This is the primary entry point for the vulnerability.
    - `/code/fbchisellldb.py`: This Python script is the main entry point for Chisel, loaded by LLDB via `.lldbinit`. It contains the `loadCommandsInDirectory` function, which recursively loads Python files from the `commands` directory. If a malicious version of this file is present, it will be executed without any integrity checks when LLDB starts.
    - `/code/fbchisellldb.py` - `loadCommandsInDirectory` function:
        ```python
        def loadCommandsInDirectory(commandsDirectory):
            for file in os.listdir(commandsDirectory):
                fileName, fileExtension = os.path.splitext(file)
                if fileExtension == ".py":
                    module = imp.load_source(fileName, os.path.join(commandsDirectory, file))
                    # ...
        ```
        This function iterates through files in the `commandsDirectory`. For each `.py` file, it uses `imp.load_source` to load and execute the Python code. There is no verification of the source or content of these files. An attacker could place malicious Python files in the `commands` directory, and they would be automatically loaded and executed when Chisel is initialized in LLDB.
    - `/code/fbchisellldb.py` - `loadCommand` function:
        ```python
        def loadCommand(module, command, directory, filename, extension):
            func = makeRunCommand(command, os.path.join(directory, filename + extension))
            # ...
            lldb.debugger.HandleCommand(
                'command script add --help "{help}" --function {function} {name}'.format(
                    # ...
                    function=functionName,
                    name=name,
                )
            )
        ```
        This function defines how Chisel commands are loaded into LLDB. It uses `makeRunCommand` to create a function that will be executed when a Chisel command is invoked in LLDB. If a malicious command is loaded, this function will be executed when the developer uses that command.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Set up a malicious Chisel environment:**
        a. Create a directory named `malicious_chisel`.
        b. Inside `malicious_chisel`, create a file named `fbchisellldb.py` with the following malicious code:
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/python
        import os
        import lldb

        def __lldb_init_module(debugger, dict):
            print("Malicious Chisel Loaded!")
            os.system("touch /tmp/pwned_by_chisel") # Simulate malicious action

        ```
        c. Create a directory named `commands` inside `malicious_chisel`. You can leave it empty or add malicious command files.
    2. **Prepare the victim environment:**
        a. On a developer machine, ensure Xcode is installed.
        b. Locate the user's home directory and find or create the `.lldbinit` file.
        c. Modify `.lldbinit` to import the malicious `fbchisellldb.py`. Assuming `malicious_chisel` is placed in the user's home directory, the line in `.lldbinit` should be:
        ```python
        command script import ~/malicious_chisel/fbchisellldb.py
        ```
    3. **Trigger the vulnerability:**
        a. Open Xcode.
        b. Create a new iOS project or open an existing one.
        c. Run the application in the simulator or on a device and start a debugging session (e.g., by setting a breakpoint or pausing execution).
    4. **Verify the exploit:**
        a. Observe the LLDB console in Xcode. You should see the output "Malicious Chisel Loaded!".
        b. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_chisel` exists on the developer's machine. The presence of this file confirms that the malicious code in `fbchisellldb.py` was executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
