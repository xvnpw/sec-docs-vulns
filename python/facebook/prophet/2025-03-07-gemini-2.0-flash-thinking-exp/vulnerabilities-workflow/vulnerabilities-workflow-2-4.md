- Vulnerability Name: Input Data Manipulation for Forecast Skewing
- Description:
    1. An attacker can manipulate the input time series data by injecting outliers or strategically crafting data points.
    2. Prophet, by design, attempts to fit the provided time series data, including any manipulated or anomalous points.
    3. If the injected data is not properly pre-processed or filtered by the user, Prophet will incorporate these manipulations into the model.
    4. This leads to a forecast that is skewed or misleading, reflecting the attacker's data manipulation rather than the true underlying trend.
- Impact:
    - Decisions based on these skewed forecasts can be misguided, leading to potentially harmful outcomes. For example, in business contexts, manipulated forecasts could lead to incorrect inventory management, resource allocation, or financial projections. In critical infrastructure, misleading forecasts could impact operational decisions with serious consequences.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation mentions outlier handling by setting outlier values to NA (`/code/docs/_docs/outliers.md`). This requires users to manually identify and mitigate outliers before feeding data to Prophet.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Automated Outlier Detection and Handling:** Prophet lacks built-in mechanisms for automatic outlier detection and mitigation. The library should include optional parameters or methods for users to enable automated outlier handling techniques (e.g., statistical methods like IQR, Z-score, or machine learning-based anomaly detection).
    - **Input Data Validation:** Prophet does not enforce strict validation rules on the input time series data beyond basic type checks. Missing input validation allows arbitrary data to be processed, including malicious inputs designed to skew forecasts. Input validation should include checks for data integrity, reasonable ranges, and consistency.
    - **Data Preprocessing Guidelines and Tools:** While documentation mentions outlier handling, it lacks comprehensive guidelines and tools for data preprocessing. The project should provide more detailed guidance on data cleaning, outlier removal, and data transformation techniques that users should apply before using Prophet to enhance robustness against data manipulation.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the input time series data that is fed to the Prophet model before forecasting. This could be achieved in various scenarios, such as:
        - If the Prophet model is used in an application where users can upload or directly input time series data.
        - If the data pipeline fetching data for Prophet is compromised, allowing for data injection or modification.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The Prophet codebase, particularly the `fit` and `predict` methods in `/code/python/prophet/forecaster.py`, focuses on model fitting and forecasting based on the input data.
    - The `setup_dataframe` method in `/code/python/prophet/forecaster.py` performs basic data type conversions and scaling but does not include checks for data validity or outlier detection.
    - The Stan model (`/code/python/prophet/stan/prophet.stan`) is designed to model the provided data, including any anomalies or manipulations present in the input.
    - Review of documentation files like `/code/docs/_docs/outliers.md`, `/code/docs/_docs/holiday_effects.md`, `/code/docs/_docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.md`, and `/code/docs/_docs/trend_changepoints.md` reveals no built-in input sanitization or outlier detection mechanisms within Prophet itself. The documentation advises users to handle outliers manually.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy a Prophet-based forecasting service that takes time series data as input via a public API endpoint.
        - Use the example dataset (e.g., Peyton Manning Wikipedia page views) for the initial model training.
    2. **Baseline Forecast:**
        - Send a request to the API with clean, unmodified time series data to generate a baseline forecast. Record the forecast output.
    3. **Data Manipulation - Inject Outliers:**
        - Create a modified dataset by injecting artificial outlier data points into the original time series data. For example, introduce sudden spikes or drops in the data for a specific period.
    4. **Malicious Forecast:**
        - Send a new request to the API with the manipulated dataset containing outliers.
        - Compare the forecast generated with the manipulated data to the baseline forecast.
    5. **Verification:**
        - Observe that the forecast generated with manipulated data is significantly skewed and deviates from the baseline forecast. The outliers injected by the attacker unduly influence the forecast, demonstrating the vulnerability.
        - For example, if positive outliers are injected, the forecast should show an artificially inflated trend, and vice versa for negative outliers.
