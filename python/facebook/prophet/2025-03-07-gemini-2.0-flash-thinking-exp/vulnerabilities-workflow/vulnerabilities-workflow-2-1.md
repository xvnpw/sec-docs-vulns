Based on the provided reasoning and instructions, the vulnerability described is not considered a vulnerability within the Prophet library itself, but rather a potential vulnerability in applications that use Prophet if they don't handle output sanitization properly. The reasoning clearly states that no XSS vulnerabilities were found within the PROJECT FILES of Prophet.  Therefore, according to the instructions to only include vulnerabilities introduced by the project and to exclude theoretical vulnerabilities without evidence in the source code of the project, the vulnerability list should be empty.
