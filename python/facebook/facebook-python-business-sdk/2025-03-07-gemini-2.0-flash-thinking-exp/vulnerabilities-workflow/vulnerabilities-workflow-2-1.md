### Vulnerability 1: Insecure Storage of Access Tokens in Example Code

- **Description:**
    - The `README.md` file provides example code in the "Bootstrapping" section that directly embeds sensitive information, including `my_app_id`, `my_app_secret`, and `my_access_token`, directly into the `test.py` script.
    - Step 1: A developer follows the "Quick Start" guide in `README.md` to bootstrap the SDK.
    - Step 2: The developer creates a `test.py` file as instructed, copy-pasting the example code and replacing the placeholder values with their actual App ID, App Secret, and Access Token.
    - Step 3: The developer may inadvertently commit this `test.py` file with the hardcoded credentials into a public or shared repository, or leave it accessible in an insecure location.
    - Step 4: An attacker gains access to this `test.py` file and extracts the `my_access_token`.
    - Step 5: The attacker can use this access token to make unauthorized API calls to Facebook Business APIs, potentially gaining access to the victim's Facebook Business account and managing ads or pages.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Unauthorized access to a user's Facebook Business account. An attacker can manage ads, pages, and potentially sensitive business information. This could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and data breaches.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Partial:** The `README.md` provides a **NOTE** to replace placeholder values, but does not explicitly warn against storing access tokens directly in code or committing them to version control.
    - **File:** `/code/README.md` - "Bootstrapping" section contains example code with placeholders.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Critical:** Explicit warning in the documentation against hardcoding access tokens and storing them in insecure locations.
    - **Essential:** Recommendation of secure storage mechanisms for access tokens, such as environment variables, secure configuration files, or dedicated secret management tools.
    - **Best Practice:** Example code should be modified to read access tokens from environment variables or a secure configuration file instead of hardcoding them.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A developer follows the "Quick Start" guide and uses the example code directly.
    - The developer stores the generated `test.py` file insecurely (e.g., public repository, insecure server).
    - An attacker gains access to this insecurely stored `test.py` file.

    ### Bootstrapping

    ### Create test.py
    Create a test.py file with the contents below (assuming your system is using python 2.7 and installed under /opt/homebrew. Update to your proper python location.):

    ```python
    my_app_id = 'your-app-id'
    my_app_secret = 'your-appsecret'
    my_access_token = 'your-page-access-token'
    FacebookAdsApi.init(my_app_id, my_app_secret, my_access_token)
    ```
    - The example code in `README.md` encourages users to directly assign access tokens (and other sensitive credentials) to variables within a Python script (`test.py`).
    - This practice is inherently insecure as it makes the access token easily discoverable if the script is inadvertently exposed.
    - The documentation lacks a clear warning about the security risks of hardcoding credentials and doesn't offer secure alternatives for managing access tokens in development or production environments.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: As an attacker, find a public GitHub repository that uses the `facebook-python-business-sdk` and contains a `test.py` file.
    - Step 2: Examine the `test.py` file for variables named `my_access_token`, `access_token`, or similar, that are assigned string literals resembling access tokens.
    - Step 3: If an access token is found, copy its value.
    - Step 4: Use a tool like `curl` or a Python script with the SDK to make an API request to Facebook's Graph API using the stolen access token. For example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/me?access_token=<STOLEN_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
    - Step 5: If the API request is successful and returns user data or business account information, the vulnerability is confirmed.

### Vulnerability 2: Lack of Secure Credential Handling Guidance in Multi-User Scenarios

- **Description:**
    - While the documentation mentions using multiple access tokens for multi-user systems, it primarily focuses on the programmatic aspect of handling multiple sessions.
    - The "Multiple Access Tokens" section in `README.md` shows how to initialize `FacebookAdsApi` with different access tokens but lacks explicit guidance on *securely managing and storing these tokens* for multiple users in a real-world application.
    - Step 1: A developer is building a system that needs to interact with Facebook Business APIs on behalf of multiple users.
    - Step 2: The developer consults the SDK documentation for guidance on handling multiple access tokens, specifically the "Multiple Access Tokens" section in `README.md`.
    - Step 3: The developer correctly implements the programmatic logic for multiple sessions as shown in the documentation.
    - Step 4: However, the developer, lacking explicit guidance on secure storage, may still resort to insecure methods like storing tokens in a database without encryption, in easily accessible configuration files, or even hardcoded lists within the application.
    - Step 5: An attacker gains access to this insecure storage and retrieves access tokens for multiple users.
    - Step 6: The attacker can then impersonate these users and perform unauthorized actions on their Facebook Business accounts.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:**  Compromise of multiple user accounts. In a multi-user system, this vulnerability can lead to widespread unauthorized access, potentially affecting numerous business accounts and users.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The documentation provides programmatic examples but no security guidance for multi-user access token management.
    - **File:** `/code/README.md` - "Multiple Access Tokens" section.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Critical:**  Documentation must include explicit and strong recommendations for secure storage of access tokens in multi-user scenarios.
    - **Essential:**  Guidance should cover best practices like:
        - Never storing access tokens in plaintext.
        - Using robust encryption methods for token storage.
        - Leveraging secure secret management services or environment variables.
        - Emphasizing the principle of least privilege when granting access to tokens.
    - **Best Practice:**  Consider adding example code snippets that demonstrate reading access tokens from environment variables or a secure vault in multi-user context.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A developer is building a multi-user system using the SDK.
    - The developer relies solely on the SDK documentation for security guidance regarding multi-user access token management.
    - The developer implements insecure access token storage due to lack of proper guidance.
    - An attacker gains access to the insecure token storage.

    ### MULTIPLE ACCESS TOKENS

    Throughout the docs, the method FacebookAdsApi.init is called before making any API calls. This
    method set up a default FacebookAdsApi object to be used everywhere. That simplifies the usage
    but it's not feasible when a system using the SDK will make calls on behalf of multiple users.

    ...

    session1 = FacebookSession(
        my_app_id,
        my_app_secret,
        my_access_token_1,
        proxies,
    )

    session2 = FacebookSession(
        my_app_id,
        my_app_secret,
        my_access_token_2,
        proxies,
    )
    ```
    - The "Multiple Access Tokens" section demonstrates the correct programmatic approach to handle multiple tokens by creating separate `FacebookSession` and `FacebookAdsApi` instances.
    - However, it only addresses the *how* of using multiple tokens in code, not the *how to securely manage* the tokens themselves in a multi-user environment.
    - The documentation is silent on the crucial security aspects of storing and protecting multiple access tokens, potentially leading developers to implement insecure storage solutions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: As an attacker, identify an application built using `facebook-python-business-sdk` that is designed for multi-user access to Facebook Business APIs. (This might require more targeted reconnaissance than vulnerability 1)
    - Step 2: Attempt to identify the mechanism used by the application to store access tokens for multiple users (e.g., database, configuration files, environment variables).
    - Step 3: Exploit any identified vulnerabilities in the storage mechanism to gain access to the stored access tokens. This might involve SQL injection, file system access, or exploiting misconfigured environment variable access.
    - Step 4: Once access tokens for multiple users are obtained, use them to make unauthorized API requests on behalf of those users, similar to step 4 and 5 in the test case for vulnerability 1.
    - Step 5: Successful unauthorized API calls using tokens of different users confirm the vulnerability.
