- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Credential Storage in Example Code

- Description:
  - The example code provided in `README.md` and `examples/dpa-update/README.md` demonstrates insecure practices by directly embedding Facebook App ID, App Secret, and Access Tokens within the source code (`test.py` and implied in README instructions).
  - Step 1: A developer follows the "Quick Start" guide in `README.md` and creates `test.py` as instructed, directly embedding their `my_app_id`, `my_app_secret`, and `my_access_token` in the file.
  - Step 2: The developer might inadvertently commit this `test.py` file, containing sensitive credentials, to a public or shared repository.
  - Step 3: An attacker gains access to this repository and extracts the exposed credentials.
  - Step 4: Using these credentials, the attacker can then initialize the Facebook Business SDK and gain unauthorized access to the Facebook Business accounts and assets associated with the compromised access token.

- Impact:
  - High. Compromise of Facebook access tokens allows unauthorized access to and control over connected Facebook business accounts. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches: Access to sensitive business data, customer data, and advertising performance data.
    - Financial loss: Unauthorized ad spending, manipulation of advertising campaigns, and potential fraud.
    - Reputational damage: Damage to brand reputation due to unauthorized actions on connected Facebook assets.
    - Account takeover: Full control over Facebook business pages, ad accounts, and other connected assets.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the example code itself.
  - The README.md provides a **NOTE** to "Replace this with the place you installed facebookads using pip", implying that the hardcoded paths should be changed, but it does not address the credential hardcoding issue.
  - The README.md has an **IMPORTANT** section recommending turning on 'App Secret Proof for Server API calls' in app settings, which enhances security but does not prevent token exposure through insecure code.
  - The README.md mentions "MULTIPLE ACCESS TOKENS" and provides an example of using `FacebookSession` with different access tokens, which is a better practice for multi-user systems but doesn't prevent hardcoding in basic examples.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Security warnings in example code:**  Adding prominent warnings in the example code against hardcoding credentials and recommending secure storage mechanisms (environment variables, configuration files, secure vaults).
  - **Best practices documentation:** Providing clear and comprehensive documentation on secure credential management for developers using the SDK, emphasizing not to hardcode credentials in source code.
  - **Secure example code:**  Providing example code that demonstrates loading credentials from environment variables or configuration files instead of directly embedding them.

- Preconditions:
  - Developer follows the "Quick Start" guide and uses the provided example code directly without implementing secure credential management practices.
  - The developer inadvertently exposes the code containing hardcoded credentials (e.g., by committing it to a public repository).

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/README.md`
  - Section: `Bootstrapping` -> `Create test.py`
  - The `test.py` example code directly assigns credentials to variables:
    ```python
    my_app_id = 'your-app-id'
    my_app_secret = 'your-appsecret'
    my_access_token = 'your-page-access-token'
    FacebookAdsApi.init(my_app_id, my_app_secret, my_access_token)
    ```
  - File: `/code/examples/dpa-update/README.md`
  - Section: `How to run` -> `2. Edit dpa_update.py and put your catalog ID in catalog_id variable`
  - Implies editing `dpa_update.py` directly, which, by following other examples, might lead to hardcoding credentials in `dpa_update.py` as well, although not explicitly shown in this file.

- Security Test Case:
  - Step 1: As an attacker, search public repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for files named `test.py` that import `facebookads`.
  - Step 2: Examine the found `test.py` files for variables like `my_app_id`, `my_app_secret`, and `my_access_token`.
  - Step 3: If these variables are assigned string literals that resemble credentials, attempt to use them with the Facebook Business SDK.
  - Step 4: Write a simple script to initialize the FacebookAdsApi with the extracted credentials and attempt to access basic business information (e.g., list ad accounts).
  - Step 5: If successful, this confirms the access token is valid and the credentials were insecurely stored, allowing unauthorized access.
