- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection Vulnerability in Researcher Tools due to Malicious IOC Data
- Description:
  - The project provides IOC data in CSV, JSON, and STIX formats for cybersecurity research.
  - This data includes various indicator types, such as URLs, domain names, and file hashes.
  - An attacker could craft malicious entries within the IOC data files. For example, they could insert a malicious URL as an `indicator_value` that, when processed by a security researcher's tool, could lead to command injection.
  - If a security researcher uses this IOC data in their automated tools without implementing proper input validation and sanitization, they could unknowingly process malicious data.
  - For instance, a researcher's tool might take URLs from the IOC data and execute commands based on them (e.g., using `curl` or `wget` in a subprocess without proper escaping). A malicious URL like `http://example.com/$(malicious_command)` could then execute arbitrary commands on the researcher's system.
  - The project itself does not include any mechanisms to validate or sanitize the IOC data to prevent such malicious entries from being included in the distributed data files.
- Impact:
  - If a security researcher uses the IOC data from this repository in their tools without proper input validation, and if the data contains malicious entries, it could lead to command injection on the researcher's system.
  - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the researcher's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The provided project files do not contain any explicit mitigations for this vulnerability. There are no input validation mechanisms in the provided script, and no warnings in the documentation about the potential risks of using the IOC data without proper validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Add a clear and prominent warning in the README.md file and potentially in other relevant documentation (like CONTRIBUTING.md) about the potential security risks associated with using IOC data without proper input validation. This warning should advise researchers to sanitize and validate all data from this repository before using it in their tools and scripts.
  - Recommend best practices for securely processing IOC data. This could include suggesting input validation techniques, using sandboxed environments for testing, and avoiding direct execution of commands based on untrusted IOC data without careful sanitization.
- Preconditions:
  - A security researcher downloads and uses the IOC data from this repository.
  - The researcher develops or uses automated tools to process this IOC data for threat analysis or other cybersecurity tasks.
  - These tools process certain fields of the IOC data (e.g., `indicator_value` for `url` type) in a way that can lead to command injection if the data is maliciously crafted.
  - The researcher's tools lack sufficient input validation and sanitization mechanisms to handle potentially malicious data from the IOC repository.
  - The IOC data in the repository contains malicious entries specifically crafted to exploit such vulnerabilities in researcher's tools.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - The provided script `utilities/tsv_to_csv_and_json.py` is responsible for converting TSV files into CSV, JSON, and STIX formats.
  - The script reads data from TSV files and directly writes it into the output files without any validation or sanitization of the `indicator_value` or other fields.
  - For example, when processing a TSV line, the script extracts `indicator_value` directly from the input line:
    ```python
    indicator_type, indicator_value, comment, ds = line.rstrip().split("\t")
    data.append({
        "indicator_type" : indicator_type,
        "indicator_value" : indicator_value,
        "comment" : comment,
        "ds" : ds
    })
    ```
  - This `indicator_value` is then written directly to CSV, JSON, and STIX files.
  - There is no code in `tsv_to_csv_and_json.py` or in the provided project files that attempts to validate or sanitize the content of the IOC data, making it possible to include malicious payloads in the data distributed by the project.
  - The vulnerability is not within the script itself, but in the project's data handling practices and lack of user warnings regarding data security.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a malicious TSV file named `malicious_ioc.tsv` with the following content:
     ```tsv
     indicator_type	indicator_value	comment	ds
     url	http://example.com/`touch /tmp/pwned`	Malicious URL for command injection test	test_ds
     ```
     This TSV file contains a malicious URL in the `indicator_value` field that includes a command injection payload (`touch /tmp/pwned`).
  2. Place `malicious_ioc.tsv` in the `indicators/tsv/` directory (you might need to create these directories if they don't exist relative to the script).
  3. Run the `tsv_to_csv_and_json.py` script with `malicious_ioc` as the indicator ID:
     ```bash
     python utilities/tsv_to_csv_and_json.py malicious_ioc
     ```
     This command will generate `malicious_ioc.csv`, `malicious_ioc.json`, `malicious_ioc.xml`, and `malicious_ioc.json` files in the respective `indicators/csv/`, `indicators/json/`, and `indicators/stix1/` directories.
  4. Create a simulated researcher tool script named `researcher_tool.py` that reads and processes the generated CSV file, specifically and *vulnerably* processing the `indicator_value` of type `url`:
     ```python
     import csv
     import subprocess

     def process_url(url):
         print(f"Processing URL: {url}")
         # Vulnerable command execution - DO NOT USE in real code
         subprocess.run(['curl', url])

     with open("indicators/csv/malicious_ioc.csv", mode='r') as csv_file:
         csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
         for row in csv_reader:
             if row['indicator_type'] == 'url':
                 process_url(row['indicator_value'])
     ```
     **Warning:** This `researcher_tool.py` script is intentionally vulnerable for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, executing commands like this without proper sanitization is highly insecure.
  5. Run the `researcher_tool.py` script:
     ```bash
     python researcher_tool.py
     ```
  6. After running the script, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created on your system. If the file exists, it indicates that the command injection payload within the malicious URL was successfully executed by the `curl` command in the `researcher_tool.py` script.
  7. This test case demonstrates that malicious IOC data, distributed by this project, can be used to trigger command injection vulnerabilities in tools that process this data without proper input validation, highlighting the potential risk associated with the project's data distribution.
