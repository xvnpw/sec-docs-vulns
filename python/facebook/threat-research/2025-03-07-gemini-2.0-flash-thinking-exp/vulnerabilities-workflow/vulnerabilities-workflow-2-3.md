### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Lack of Data Integrity Verification (Missing Digital Signatures)
- Description: The repository provides Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and threat intelligence data in CSV, JSON, and STIX formats. However, these files are not digitally signed. This lack of digital signatures allows an attacker to create modified versions of these IOC files and distribute them through social engineering, falsely claiming they are legitimate data from Meta. Unsuspecting security researchers and analysts who rely on this repository might unknowingly use the attacker's manipulated data.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker downloads an IOC file (e.g., a CSV file) from the legitimate repository.
    2. The attacker modifies the downloaded IOC file, replacing legitimate IOCs with malicious or fabricated ones. For example, they could replace benign URLs with URLs leading to malware, or alter file hashes to match harmless files.
    3. The attacker hosts the modified IOC file on a website, shares it via email, or distributes it through other channels, falsely presenting it as an updated or enhanced IOC list from Meta. They might mimic the style and branding of the original repository to increase credibility.
    4. A security researcher, believing the attacker's deceptive claim, downloads and uses the modified IOC file in their threat analysis or security tools.
    5. The researcher's analysis or tools now operate based on falsified threat intelligence data, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions, wasted resources, or even compromised systems if actions are taken based on false information.

- Impact: Researchers using falsified IOC data might misidentify threats, block legitimate traffic, or fail to detect actual attacks. This can lead to wasted resources, incorrect security postures, and potentially compromised systems if security decisions and actions are based on false or manipulated threat intelligence. The credibility of the repository as a reliable source of threat intelligence is also undermined.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The repository does not implement any mechanism for verifying the integrity or authenticity of the IOC data files. There are no digital signatures or checksums provided for the data files.
- Missing Mitigations: Implement digital signatures for all IOC data files (CSV, JSON, STIX) published in the repository. This would involve:
    - Generating digital signatures for each data file using a private key controlled by Meta.
    - Publishing the corresponding public key in a secure and easily accessible location (e.g., within the repository or on Meta's official security website).
    - Providing clear instructions and tools for users to verify the digital signatures of the downloaded IOC files using the public key.
    - Consider using standard signing formats and tools to ensure interoperability and ease of use for researchers.
- Preconditions:
    - The primary precondition is the attacker's ability to successfully execute a social engineering attack, convincing security researchers or analysts to download and use their modified IOC files instead of the legitimate ones from the official repository.
    - The lack of any data integrity verification mechanism in the repository is a necessary precondition for this vulnerability to be exploitable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided source code (`/code/utilities/tsv_to_csv_and_json.py`) is responsible for generating the CSV, JSON, and STIX files from TSV input.
    - Review of the script and the repository files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) reveals no implementation or mention of digital signatures or any other data integrity verification mechanisms for the published IOC data files.
    - The vulnerability is not due to a flaw in the code's functionality but rather the *absence* of a crucial security feature â€“ digital signing â€“ for ensuring data integrity and authenticity.
    - The script focuses on data format conversion and does not address security aspects like data signing.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Access to the public GitHub repository (`https://github.com/facebook/threat-research`).
    2. **Download Legitimate IOC File:** Download a sample IOC file (e.g., a CSV file) from the `/indicators/csv/` directory of the repository using `wget` or `curl`. For example: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/threat-research/main/indicators/csv/example_ioc.csv -O legitimate_ioc.csv` (replace `example_ioc.csv` with an actual file name if available).
    3. **Modify IOC File:** Open the downloaded `legitimate_ioc.csv` file in a text editor. Modify one or more IOC entries. For example, if there are URL indicators, replace a benign URL with `http://malicious-example.com`. Save the modified file as `malicious_ioc.csv`.
    4. **Host Modified File (Simulate Attacker):**  Set up a simple web server (e.g., using Python's `http.server`) or use a file sharing service to host the `malicious_ioc.csv` file. Create a link to this file.
    5. **Craft Social Engineering Message:** Create a plausible social engineering message (e.g., email, social media post, forum post) targeting security researchers. The message should falsely claim that the `malicious_ioc.csv` file is an updated or enhanced IOC list from Meta's Threat Research repository. Include the link to the hosted `malicious_ioc.csv` file. For example: "ðŸš¨ Urgent Security Update: Meta Threat Research has released an updated IOC list for the latest campaign. Download the enhanced list here: [link to malicious_ioc.csv]".
    6. **Simulate Researcher Downloading and Using File:** As a simulated researcher, click on the link in the social engineering message and download `malicious_ioc.csv`.
    7. **Verification:** Examine the downloaded `malicious_ioc.csv` file. Observe that it is structurally identical to the legitimate IOC files from the repository (CSV format). There is no visual indication or metadata within the file itself that distinguishes it as malicious or modified.
    8. **Outcome:**  A researcher who trusts the social engineering message and uses `malicious_ioc.csv` will be processing falsified threat intelligence data. They have no easy way to verify the authenticity of the file because the repository lacks digital signatures. This demonstrates the vulnerability: an attacker can distribute modified IOCs and trick users into using them due to the lack of data integrity verification in the repository.
