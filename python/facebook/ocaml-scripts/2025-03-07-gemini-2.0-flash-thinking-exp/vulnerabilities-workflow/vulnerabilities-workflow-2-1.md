- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Opam Switch Name
- Description:
    1. The `dromedary.py` script takes an optional `-s` or `--switch` argument to specify the opam switch to use.
    2. The `opam_switch_env` function in `dromedary.py` constructs an `opam env` command using an f-string. If a switch name is provided via the `-s` argument, it is directly embedded into the command string.
    3. A malicious user can provide a crafted switch name containing shell metacharacters (e.g., backticks, semicolons, pipes, etc.) through the `-s` argument.
    4. This crafted switch name allows the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `opam env` command. For example, providing a switch name like `test_switch'; touch injected_command_executed; #` will inject the command `touch injected_command_executed`.
    5. The script executes this constructed command using `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)`, which interprets the shell metacharacters in the crafted switch name.
    6. This results in the execution of the injected command along with the intended `opam env` command, effectively allowing arbitrary command execution on the system with the privileges of the user running the script.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server or user's machine where `dromedary.py` is executed, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code directly uses user-provided input in a shell command without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Sanitize and validate the switch name provided by the user to ensure it does not contain shell metacharacters. A whitelist approach for allowed characters in switch names would be beneficial.
    - Secure command execution:  Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run`. Instead, pass the command and its arguments as a list to `subprocess.run`. This prevents shell injection as the shell is not involved in parsing the command.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `dromedary.py` script with the `-s` or `--switch` argument. This is typically possible if the attacker has access to the command line interface where the script is run, or if the script is integrated into a system where user-controlled input can be passed to the `-s` argument.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/dromedary.py`
    - Function: `opam_switch_env(switch: Optional[str])`
    ```python
    def opam_switch_env(switch: Optional[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        cmd = OPAM_SWITCH_ENV_CMD
        if switch is not None:
            cmd = f"{OPAM_SWITCH_ENV_SET_CMD} {switch}" # [VULNERABILITY] User-provided 'switch' is directly embedded in the shell command string via f-string.
        out = subprocess.run(
            cmd,
            shell=True, # [VULNERABILITY] shell=True enables shell interpretation of metacharacters, allowing command injection.
            capture_output=True,
            check=False,
        )  # nosec
        # ... rest of the function ...
    ```
    - Visualization:
    ```
    User Input (switch name via -s argument) --> opam_switch_env function --> String construction using f-string (cmd = f"{OPAM_SWITCH_ENV_SET_CMD} {switch}") --> subprocess.run(shell=True, cmd) --> Command Execution with shell interpretation --> Vulnerability: Command Injection
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a test environment where you can run `dromedary.py`. Ensure you have Python 3 installed and the script is accessible.
    2. Open a terminal in the directory containing `dromedary.py`.
    3. Execute the `dromedary.py` script with a malicious switch name using the `-s` argument. The malicious switch name will be designed to execute a simple command like creating a file. For example:
       ```bash
       python3 dromedary.py -s "test_switch'; touch injected_command_executed; #" -o output.BUCK
       ```
       In this command, `test_switch'; touch injected_command_executed; #` is the malicious switch name.  The intention is to inject the command `touch injected_command_executed`. The `#` is added to comment out any subsequent part of the intended `opam` command, preventing errors.
    4. After running the command, check if a file named `injected_command_executed` has been created in the same directory where you executed the script.
    5. If the file `injected_command_executed` exists, it confirms that the injected command `touch injected_command_executed` was successfully executed. This demonstrates a successful command injection vulnerability via the opam switch name.
    6. To further verify, you can try more harmful commands instead of `touch`, such as `rm -rf /tmp/vulnerable_test` (be extremely cautious when testing destructive commands and use a safe test environment).
