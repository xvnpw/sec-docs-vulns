### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Package Name in JSON Configuration

- Description:
    1. The `dromedary.py` script processes a JSON configuration file to generate Opam switches and install packages.
    2. The script reads the `packages` array from the JSON configuration, which is expected to be a list of package names for `opam install`.
    3. The script then executes the `opam install` command using `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, passing the package names directly from the JSON configuration as arguments.
    4. If an attacker can control the content of the JSON configuration file, they can inject malicious package names containing shell commands.
    5. For example, a malicious package name could be crafted as `'package' ; touch /tmp/pwned`.
    6. When `dromedary.py` executes `opam install` with this malicious package name, the shell interprets the `;` as a command separator and executes the injected command (`touch /tmp/pwned`) after the `opam install` command.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system where `dromedary.py` is run.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the system.
        - System compromise: Gaining complete control over the system.
        - Privilege escalation: Elevating privileges to perform administrative tasks.
        - Denial of Service: Disrupting the normal operation of the system.
        - Malware installation: Installing backdoors or other malicious software.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses user-supplied package names in shell commands without any sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize the package names from the JSON configuration to remove or escape shell metacharacters before passing them to the `opam install` command.
    - Use `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and pass package names as a list to avoid shell interpretation. This is the most effective mitigation.
    - Input validation: Validate the package names to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain suspicious characters.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to provide a malicious JSON configuration file to `dromedary.py`. This could happen if:
        - `dromedary.py` is designed to read configuration from user-supplied files.
        - There is another vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify the JSON configuration file used by `dromedary.py`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`dromedary.py:304`**: `def install_packages(packages: List[str], cmd_env: Dict[str, str]) -> None:` - This function takes a list of package names as input.
    2. **`dromedary.py:312`**: `inst_args = OPAM_INSTALL_COMMAND` -  `OPAM_INSTALL_COMMAND` is defined as `[OPAM_EXE, "install", "--yes"]`.
    3. **`dromedary.py:313`**: `inst_args.extend(packages)` - The package names from the JSON config are directly appended to the `inst_args` list.
    4. **`dromedary.py:314`**: `run_cmd_output(inst_args, cmd_env=cmd_env)` - The `inst_args` (which now includes unsanitized package names) is passed to `run_cmd_output`.
    5. **`dromedary.py:183`**: `def run_cmd_output(cmd_args: List[Any], cmd_env: Optional[Dict[str, str]]) -> None:` - This function executes the command.
    6. **`dromedary.py:200`**: `proc = subprocess.run(...)` -  `subprocess.run` is called with `shell=True`.
    7. **`dromedary.py:201`**: `" ".join(map(lambda e: f"'{str(e)}'", cmd_args))` -  The command arguments are joined by spaces and quoted in single quotes, but this quoting is insufficient to prevent command injection when `shell=True` and malicious package names are used.

        B --> C{inst_args.extend(packages)};
        C --> D[run_cmd_output];
        D --> E[subprocess.run - shell=True];
        E --> F[Shell executes command];
        F --> G{Command Injection if packages are malicious};
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a file named `malicious_config.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "./evil_switch",
        "compiler": "ocaml-base-compiler",
        "packages": [
            "'package' ; touch /tmp/pwned"
        ]
    }
    ```
    2. Run the `dromedary.py` script with the malicious configuration file and specify an output BUCK file:
    ```bash
    python3 dromedary.py -o BUCK malicious_config.json
    ```
    3. After the script executes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists:
    ```bash
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```
    4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful.
    5. To further verify, check the standard output and error output of the `dromedary.py` script for any errors or unusual messages that might indicate the attempted command injection.
