- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web UI via Malicious SARIF Output

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious SARIF output file.
  2. This SARIF file contains specially crafted data in fields that are displayed in the SAPP web UI, such as issue messages, filenames, or code snippets within traces. This crafted data includes malicious JavaScript code.
  3. The attacker imports this malicious SARIF output file into SAPP using the `sapp analyze` command.
  4. A user (victim) accesses the SAPP web UI to explore the static analysis results, including the malicious SARIF output.
  5. When SAPP web UI renders the data from the malicious SARIF file, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the crafted data is executed in the victim's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- Impact:
  - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the SAPP web UI.
  - This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing the victim's session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Defacing the SAPP web UI.
    - Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim within the SAPP application.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Codebase uses `json.dumps` in `sapp/sarif.py` to serialize SARIF output to JSON format, but this is for data serialization, not for sanitizing output against XSS when rendering in HTML.
  - The project uses React for the frontend, which by default escapes values rendered in JSX, but if `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar mechanisms are used without proper sanitization, XSS is still possible.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Output sanitization of user-controlled data, especially when rendering in HTML within the web UI.
  - Context-aware output encoding should be implemented in the frontend components that display data from SARIF files. This would involve escaping HTML special characters and JavaScript code within user-controlled data before rendering it in the web UI.
  - Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the resources that the browser is allowed to load.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SARIF output file to SAPP. This can be done if the SAPP instance processes externally provided static analysis results.
  - A victim needs to access the SAPP web UI and view the analysis results that include the malicious SARIF output.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. **File: `/code/sapp/sarif.py`**: This file is responsible for converting SAPP's internal issue representation into SARIF format. The `SARIF` class and `issue_to_sarif` method are key. This code generates JSON output based on analysis results, which is then consumed by the web UI.
  ```python
  class SARIF:
      # ...
      def issue_to_sarif(
          self,
          session: Session,
          issue: IssueQueryResult,
          severity_level: str = "warning",
      ) -> SARIFResult:
          # ...
          result: SARIFResult = {
              "ruleId": str(issue.code),
              "level": str(SARIFSeverityLevel(severity_level)),
              "message": {
                  "text": issue.message, # Potential user-controlled data from database
              },
              "locations": [location],
              "codeFlows": self.trace_to_sarif(session, issue, output_features=True),
          }
          return result
  ```
  The `issue.message` is directly included in the SARIF output without sanitization.
  2. **File: `/code/setup.py`**: This file indicates that frontend code is included in `sapp.ui` package and served:
  ```python
  package_data={
      "sapp.ui": [
          "frontend/build/*",
          "frontend/build/static/css/*",
          "frontend/build/static/js/*",
      ],
  },
  ```
  3. **File: `/code/sapp/ui/server.py`**: This file sets up the Flask server and serves the frontend build:
  ```python
  application = Flask(
      __name__, static_folder=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "frontend", "build")
  )

  # ...

  @application.route("/", defaults={"path": ""})
  @application.route("/<path:path>")
  def serve(path: str) -> Response:
      # ...
      return send_from_directory(static_folder, "index.html")
  ```
  4. **File: `/code/sapp/ui/frontend/src/...`**: (Frontend React code - not provided in PROJECT FILES, requires separate analysis). Analyze the React components responsible for displaying issue details, traces, and any data from the SARIF output. Check for usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or any components that render raw HTML without proper escaping, especially when displaying `issue.message` or parts of code snippets from traces.

**Visualization:**

Data flow: `Malicious SARIF File` -> `sapp analyze` -> `SAPP Database` -> `SAPP Backend (Flask)` -> `SAPP Frontend (React)` -> `Victim's Browser (XSS)`

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a malicious SARIF file (e.g., `malicious_sarif.json`) with a crafted issue message containing JavaScript code:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "2.1.0",
       "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/master/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json",
       "runs": [
         {
           "tool": {
             "driver": {
               "name": "Pysa",
               "informationUri": "https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/"
             }
           },
           "results": [
             {
               "ruleId": "5000",
               "level": "warning",
               "message": {
                 "text": "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>"
               },
               "locations": [
                 {
                   "physicalLocation": {
                     "artifactLocation": {
                       "uri": "example.py"
                     },
                     "region": {
                       "startLine": 1,
                       "startColumn": 1
                     }
                   }
                 }
               ],
               "codeFlows": []
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
  2. Run SAPP `analyze` command to process the malicious SARIF file, assuming `sapp.db` is the database name:
     ```bash
     sapp --database-name sapp.db analyze malicious_sarif.json
     ```
  3. Start the SAPP web server:
     ```bash
     sapp --database-name sapp.db server --source-directory=.
     ```
  4. Access the SAPP web UI in a browser (usually `http://localhost:13337`).
  5. Navigate to the "Issues" or "Explore" section in the SAPP web UI and find the issue from the `malicious_sarif.json` file (it might be the latest issue).
  6. Observe that an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability!" is displayed in the browser, indicating successful XSS exploitation.

This test case demonstrates that malicious JavaScript injected into the `message.text` field of a SARIF output file can be executed when the SAPP web UI renders the issue details, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
