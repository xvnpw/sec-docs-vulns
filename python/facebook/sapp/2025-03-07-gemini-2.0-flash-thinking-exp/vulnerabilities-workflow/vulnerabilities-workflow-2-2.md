- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Issue Message Display

- Description:
  1. An attacker injects a malicious XSS payload into the message field of a static analysis issue. This can be achieved by manipulating the input to static analysis tools like Pysa or Mariana Trench before feeding the results to SAPP.
  2. SAPP processes the tainted static analysis results and stores them in its database without sufficient sanitization of the message field.
  3. A user accesses the SAPP web UI and views the issue details, which includes the contaminated message.
  4. The web UI retrieves the raw message content from the database and renders it directly in the user's browser, without proper output encoding or sanitization.
  5. The attacker's XSS payload, embedded within the message, executes in the user's browser within the context of the SAPP web application.

- Impact:
  * **High**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they view the affected issue in the SAPP web UI. This can lead to:
    * **Account Takeover**: Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information to impersonate the user.
    * **Data Exfiltration**: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data accessible within the SAPP web application or the user's browser context.
    * **Malware Distribution**: Redirecting the user to malicious websites or injecting malware into their browser session.
    * **Defacement**: Altering the appearance of the SAPP web UI for the user.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  * **None**: Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit evidence of output sanitization or encoding being implemented in the SAPP web UI to prevent XSS when displaying issue messages or other potentially user-controlled data from the database.

- Missing Mitigations:
  * **Output Encoding/Sanitization**: Implement proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) or sanitization for all user-controlled data rendered in the web UI, especially issue messages, feature names, and any other fields derived from static analysis results. This should be applied in the frontend code where data from the backend is dynamically rendered.
  * **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the actions an attacker can perform even if they manage to inject malicious scripts.

- Preconditions:
  1. An attacker must be able to influence the static analysis results processed by SAPP, specifically the message field of an issue. This could involve submitting crafted code to a static analysis tool or directly manipulating the input JSON if access is possible.
  2. A user must access the SAPP web UI and view the details of an issue containing the malicious XSS payload in its message.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. The provided project files do not include the frontend code for the web UI, so direct analysis of the rendering logic for issue messages is not possible from these files alone.
  2. However, the description of SAPP and the focus on XSS as an attack vector strongly suggest that the web UI dynamically renders data from the static analysis results, including issue messages.
  3. The file `/code/sapp/sarif.py` is related to SARIF output, which is a standardized format for static analysis results. This indicates that SAPP processes and potentially displays data originating from static analysis tools.
  4. The `/code/sapp/ui` directory suggests the presence of UI-related code in the backend, possibly for serving data to the frontend.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prepare a malicious payload**: Create a static analysis output file (e.g., a modified `taint-output.json` for Pysa) where the message field of an issue contains a JavaScript payload. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "kind": "issue",
       "data": {
         "callable": "test_callable",
         "callable_line": 1,
         "code": 9999,
         "line": 1,
         "start": 1,
         "end": 1,
         "filename": "test.py",
         "message": "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability');</script>Malicious issue message"
         ...
       }
     }
     ```
  2. **Analyze the payload**: Run SAPP's `analyze` command, providing the modified static analysis output file as input:
     ```shell
     sapp --database-name sapp_xss_test.db analyze malicious_taint_output.json
     ```
  3. **Start the SAPP web server**: Launch the SAPP web server, pointing it to the database created in the previous step and the source code directory:
     ```shell
     sapp --database-name sapp_xss_test.db server --source-directory=/path/to/your/code
     ```
  4. **Access the SAPP web UI**: Open a web browser and navigate to the SAPP web UI (typically http://localhost:13337).
  5. **Explore the issues**: Locate and view the details of the issue that was modified to include the XSS payload (in this example, the issue with code 9999).
  6. **Verify XSS execution**: Observe if the JavaScript payload executes in the browser. In this example, a JavaScript alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" should appear. If the alert box appears, it confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability.
