## Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web UI via Malicious Input

### Description:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious input file, such as a SARIF output file or a taint-output.json file from a static analysis tool.
2. This malicious file contains specially crafted data within fields that are intended for display in the SAPP web UI. These fields can include issue messages, filenames, code snippets in traces, callable names, or other data points originating from the static analysis results. The crafted data embeds malicious JavaScript code.
3. The attacker provides this malicious input file to SAPP, typically by using the `sapp analyze` command to process it. This action imports the malicious data into the SAPP database.
4. A user (victim), such as an administrator or a security analyst, accesses the SAPP web UI to review the static analysis results.
5. When the SAPP web UI renders the data from the processed malicious input file, it retrieves the data from the database and directly embeds it into the HTML of the web page without proper sanitization or output encoding.
6. Consequently, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within the crafted data is executed in the victim's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### Impact:
- **High**: Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session when they are using the SAPP web UI. This can lead to severe security consequences, including:
    - **Account Takeover**: Stealing the victim's session cookies or other authentication tokens, enabling the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to the SAPP application and potentially other services accessible through the victim's session.
    - **Data Exfiltration**: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information displayed within the SAPP web UI or any data accessible within the victim's browser context, potentially including source code, analysis results, or other confidential data.
    - **Malware Distribution**: Redirecting the victim to malicious websites controlled by the attacker, potentially leading to further attacks such as phishing or malware installation on the victim's system.
    - **Defacement**: Modifying the appearance or functionality of the SAPP web UI as seen by the victim, causing disruption and potentially undermining trust in the application.
    - **Performing Actions on Behalf of the Victim**: Using the victim's authenticated session to perform actions within the SAPP application or other web applications, potentially including modifying data, triggering actions, or further compromising the system.

### Vulnerability Rank: High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- **None**: Based on the provided code snippets and descriptions, there are no effective mitigations currently implemented in the SAPP project to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when rendering data from static analysis results in the web UI.
- The codebase uses `json.dumps` in `sapp/sarif.py` for serializing data to JSON format, but this is solely for data serialization and does not provide any protection against XSS when the data is rendered as HTML in the web UI.
- While the project uses React for the frontend, React's default JSX escaping mechanism might offer some protection, but it is insufficient if `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar mechanisms are used to render raw HTML, or if data is not properly escaped before being passed to React components.  The provided analysis suggests that the application is likely vulnerable due to a lack of output sanitization specifically in the frontend rendering logic.

### Missing Mitigations:
- **Output Sanitization/Encoding**: Implement robust output sanitization or context-aware output encoding for all user-controlled data that is rendered in the SAPP web UI. This is crucial for preventing XSS.
    - Specifically, when displaying issue messages, code snippets, filenames, callable names, and any other data originating from static analysis results, the frontend components must ensure that HTML special characters and JavaScript code are properly escaped before being rendered.
    - HTML entity encoding should be applied to text content to prevent browsers from interpreting it as HTML markup.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk and impact of XSS attacks.
    - A properly configured CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and images. This can limit the actions an attacker can perform even if they manage to inject malicious scripts into the page.
- **Input Sanitization at Backend**: While output encoding in the frontend is essential, consider implementing input sanitization on the backend as a defense-in-depth measure. Sanitizing data before storing it in the database can provide an additional layer of protection, although it should not be relied upon as the primary XSS mitigation.

### Preconditions:
1. **Malicious Input Creation**: An attacker must be able to create or modify a static analysis output file (e.g., SARIF or taint-output.json) to include malicious JavaScript code in data fields intended for display in the SAPP web UI. This is generally feasible as the format of these files is often based on documented standards or tool outputs and can be manipulated.
2. **Processing Malicious Input by SAPP**: An administrator or user with access to the SAPP command-line tool must process the malicious input file using SAPP, for instance, by running the `sapp analyze` command. This action imports the malicious data into the SAPP database.
3. **Victim Accessing Web UI**: A victim user, who could be an administrator, developer, or security analyst using the SAPP web UI, must access and view the analysis results that contain the malicious data. This typically involves navigating to the issues list or issue details page in the web UI.

### Source Code Analysis:
1. **Backend Data Handling (`sapp/sarif.py`, `sapp/cli_lib.py`, etc.)**:
   - Files like `sapp/sarif.py` (for SARIF input) and potentially other files handling different static analysis output formats are responsible for parsing and processing input files.
   - The `issue_to_sarif` method in `sapp/sarif.py`, as shown in the provided code, directly includes data like `issue.message` into the SARIF output without any sanitization.
   - This data, originating from potentially attacker-controlled input files, is then stored in the SAPP database.
   - There is no evidence of input sanitization being performed on this data before it is stored in the database.

   ```python
   # File: /code/sapp/sarif.py
   class SARIF:
       # ...
       def issue_to_sarif(
           self,
           session: Session,
           issue: IssueQueryResult,
           severity_level: str = "warning",
       ) -> SARIFResult:
           # ...
           result: SARIFResult = {
               "ruleId": str(issue.code),
               "level": str(SARIFSeverityLevel(severity_level)),
               "message": {
                   "text": issue.message, # POTENTIAL XSS - No sanitization of issue.message
               },
               # ...
           }
           return result
   ```

2. **Web UI Backend (`sapp/ui/server.py`, `sapp/ui/schema.py`, etc.)**:
   - The backend code in `sapp/ui` is responsible for serving data to the frontend web UI.
   - Files like `sapp/ui/schema.py` and `sapp/ui/query_result.py` likely define the GraphQL schema and data retrieval logic used by the frontend to fetch analysis results from the database.
   - The backend serves this data, which includes the unsanitized data originating from the input files, to the frontend.

3. **Web UI Frontend (`sapp/ui/frontend/src/...`)**:
   - **Frontend code is not provided for detailed analysis.**
   - The vulnerability likely resides in the React frontend components that render the analysis results.
   - If these components directly render data received from the backend (such as issue messages, filenames, etc.) into HTML without proper output encoding or sanitization, XSS vulnerabilities will occur.
   - Suspect areas include components responsible for displaying issue details, code snippets in traces, and any other data derived from the processed input files.
   - Look for usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar patterns that might bypass React's default escaping and lead to raw HTML rendering.

**Data Flow Visualization:**

```
Malicious Input File (SARIF/taint-output.json) --> sapp analyze --> SAPP Database (Unsanitized Data) --> SAPP Backend (Flask/GraphQL) --> SAPP Frontend (React - Vulnerable Rendering) --> Victim's Browser (XSS Execution)
```

### Security Test Case:
1. **Create a Malicious SARIF File (e.g., `malicious_xss.sarif.json`)**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "2.1.0",
     "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/master/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json",
     "runs": [
       {
         "tool": {
           "driver": {
             "name": "TestTool"
           }
         },
         "results": [
           {
             "ruleId": "XSS-TEST",
             "level": "warning",
             "message": {
               "text": "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>"
             },
             "locations": [
               {
                 "physicalLocation": {
                   "artifactLocation": {
                     "uri": "test.py"
                   },
                   "region": {
                     "startLine": 1,
                     "startColumn": 1
                   }
                 }
               }
             ],
             "codeFlows": []
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Analyze the Malicious SARIF File with SAPP**:
   ```bash
   sapp --database-name sapp_xss_test.db analyze malicious_xss.sarif.json
   ```

3. **Start the SAPP Web Server**:
   ```bash
   sapp --database-name sapp_xss_test.db server --source-directory=.
   ```

4. **Access the SAPP Web UI**: Open a web browser and navigate to the SAPP web UI, typically `http://localhost:13337`.

5. **Navigate to Issues and Locate the Malicious Issue**: Browse to the "Issues" or "Explore" section of the web UI. Find the issue originating from `malicious_xss.sarif.json` (it might be the most recent issue).

6. **Verify XSS Execution**: View the details of the issue. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" appears in the browser window.

7. **Alternative Verification - Inspect HTML Source**: If the alert box doesn't immediately appear, inspect the HTML source code of the issue details page in the browser's developer tools. Search for the injected JavaScript payload `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>`. If this payload is present in the HTML without being properly encoded (e.g., HTML entities), it confirms the XSS vulnerability even if the alert doesn't trigger due to specific browser behavior or CSP (if any, though none is expected based on analysis).

If the alert box appears or the unencoded JavaScript payload is found in the HTML source, the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is confirmed.
