### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Configuration File Injection leading to Malicious Artifact Distribution

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains write access to the GitHub repository, for example, by compromising a maintainer's account, insider threat, or through a malicious pull request that gets merged.
    2. The attacker modifies the `dotslash-config.json` file within the repository (typically located in `.github/workflows/dotslash-config.json`). This file dictates how DotSlash files are generated, including which release artifacts to include and from where to download them.
    3. In the modified `dotslash-config.json`, the attacker can manipulate several parameters:
        * **Direct URL Injection:** Change the download `url` within a platform entry's `providers` section to point to a malicious binary hosted on an attacker-controlled server or a compromised location.
        * **Digest Manipulation:** Modify the `digest` value to match the hash of a malicious binary that the attacker will upload to the release, or to bypass hash checking if implemented incorrectly in `dotslash-cli` (though this action focuses on generation, not client-side verification).
        * **Artifact Selection Manipulation:** Alter the `regex` or `name` fields within the `outputs` and `platforms` sections to match and select a malicious artifact instead of the intended legitimate one. This malicious artifact could be hosted within the same GitHub release (uploaded by a compromised account or workflow) or, if the HTTP provider is enabled, even from an external malicious URL.
    4. When the GitHub Action `dotslash-publish-release` runs (triggered by a new release or workflow completion), it reads the compromised `dotslash-config.json`.
    5. The action generates a DotSlash file based on the attacker's modified configuration. This DotSlash file now contains instructions to download and execute the malicious artifact, either by embedding a malicious URL directly or by pointing to a maliciously selected artifact within the release.
    6. Users who download and execute the generated DotSlash file will unknowingly download and execute the malicious binary or artifact from the attacker-controlled source or the manipulated release artifact, instead of the intended legitimate software.

* Impact:
    * **Critical:** Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the machines of users who download and use the DotSlash files generated by this GitHub Action. This represents a severe supply chain attack, as users are tricked into downloading malware through a seemingly trusted source (the legitimate software release). This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks. The reputation of the project and repository is also severely damaged.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None in the `dotslash-publish-release` action to prevent configuration file modification or validate its contents. The action processes the configuration file and generates DotSlash files without any validation of the URLs, artifact selection logic (`regex`, `name`), or other critical parameters within the configuration. Hash verification is implemented in `dotslash-cli` for downloaded artifacts, but this action only *generates* the DotSlash files and does not perform any validation on the *configuration* itself or the *source* of the artifacts before including them in the DotSlash manifest.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input Validation for `dotslash-config.json`:** The action should rigorously validate the contents of the `dotslash-config.json` file. Specifically:
        * **URL Validation:** Restrict URLs in `providers` to only originate from trusted domains, such as `github.com` or the official domain of the software project. Sanitize and validate URLs to prevent injection of arbitrary URLs. Consider using URL parsing libraries to enforce allowed schemes (e.g., `https` only) and domains.
        * **Artifact Selection Validation:** Implement checks to ensure that `regex` and `name` configurations for artifact selection are safe and do not allow for overly broad or malicious matching patterns. This is complex, but consider limiting the complexity of allowed regex or using a more restrictive matching mechanism.
        * **Schema Validation:** Enforce a strict JSON schema for `dotslash-config.json` to ensure the file structure and data types are as expected, preventing unexpected or malicious configuration structures.
    * **Content Integrity Check for `dotslash-config.json`:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the `dotslash-config.json` file itself. This could involve:
        * **Configuration Signing:** Sign the configuration file and verify the signature in the action before processing it. This would require a mechanism to securely manage signing keys.
        * **Checksumming:**  Generate a checksum of the configuration file and store it securely (e.g., in a separate file in a protected branch). Verify the checksum before processing the configuration.
        * **Branch Protection and Code Review:** Emphasize and enforce the use of branch protection rules and mandatory code reviews for any changes to `dotslash-config.json` to minimize the risk of unauthorized modifications.
    * **Documentation Enhancement:** Clearly document the security risks associated with using this action and emphasize the critical importance of securing repository write access and diligently monitoring for unauthorized configuration changes. Highlight that the action's security is directly tied to the repository's security posture.

* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs write access to the repository to modify the `dotslash-config.json` file.
    * The GitHub Action workflow that uses `dotslash-publish-release` must be triggered after the malicious modification. This is typically triggered by a new release or workflow completion of artifact upload.
    * Users must download and execute the generated DotSlash file.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`action.yml`:** Defines the action, taking `config` as input, which is the path to `dotslash-config.json`.
    2. **`process_config.py`:**
        * **Configuration Loading (`get_config` function):** Reads and parses the `dotslash-config.json` file. It fetches the config file content using `gh api` from the repository or reads it locally if `--local-config` is used. No validation is performed on the content fetched.
        ```python
        def get_config(
            *, path_to_config: str, config_ref: str, github_repository: str, api_url: str
        ) -> Any:
            args = [
                "gh",
                "api",
                "-X",
                "GET",
                f"{api_url}/repos/{github_repository}/contents/{path_to_config}",
                "-H",
                "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw",
                "-f",
                f"ref={config_ref}",
            ]
            output = subprocess.check_output(args)
            return json.loads(output.decode("utf-8"))
        ```
        * **Processing `outputs` and `platforms` in `map_platforms`:** The `map_platforms` function processes the `outputs` and `platforms` sections from the parsed `dotslash-config.json`. It retrieves `name` or `regex` values directly from the configuration to match release assets.

        ```python
        def map_platforms(output_config, name_to_asset):
            platform_entries = []
            platforms_config = output_config.get(PLATFORMS_PARAM, [])
            if not platforms_config:
                logging.warning(f"no platforms specified in output config: {output_config}")
                return platform_entries

            for platform_name, platform_config in platforms_config.items():
                asset = None
                asset_name = platform_config.get("name")
                asset_regex = platform_config.get("regex")

                if asset_name:
                    asset = name_to_asset.get(asset_name)
                    if not asset:
                        logging.warning(f"asset with name `{asset_name}` not found in release assets")
                        continue
                elif asset_regex:
                    matched_assets = [
                        a for name, a in name_to_asset.items() if re.match(asset_regex, name)
                    ]
                    if not matched_assets:
                        logging.warning(f"no assets matched regex `{asset_regex}`")
                        continue
                    if len(matched_assets) > 1:
                        logging.warning(f"more than one asset matched regex `{asset_regex}`: {matched_assets}")
                        continue
                    asset = matched_assets[0]
                else:
                    logging.warning(
                        f"no `name` or `regex` specified for platform `{platform_name}` in output config: {output_config}"
                    )
                    continue
                # ... rest of the function processing the asset
        ```
        * **Generating Manifest File (`generate_manifest_file` function):** This function constructs the DotSlash manifest file. It takes `platform_entries` derived from the parsed `dotslash-config.json` and directly uses the `asset["url"]` (from GitHub release assets, indirectly controlled by `dotslash-config.json` through `regex` or `name` matching) and potentially `providers` URLs defined in the config, embedding them into the DotSlash manifest without validation.

        ```python
        def generate_manifest_file(
            name: str,
            gh_repo_arg: str,
            tag: str,
            platform_entries,
            include_http_provider: bool,
            include_github_release_provider: bool,
        ) -> str:
            # ...
            providers = []
            for platform_entry in platform_entries:
                if "providers" in platform_entry:  # Providers directly from config
                    providers.extend(platform_entry["providers"]) # Directly using providers from config
                elif include_http_provider and "asset" in platform_entry and platform_entry["asset"]: # Fallback to asset URL if no providers and http provider is enabled
                    providers.append(
                        {
                            "url": platform_entry["asset"]["url"], # URL from github release asset, indirectly from config
                        }
                    )
            # ...
            artifact_entry = {
                # ...
                "providers": providers,
            }
            # ...
        ```
        * **No Input Validation:** No URL validation, sanitization, or validation of `regex`/`name` patterns is performed anywhere in the script. The action directly uses the values from the parsed JSON configuration to construct the DotSlash file.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the repository containing this GitHub Action and a sample project that uses it.
    2. **Modify `dotslash-config.json`:** In your forked repository, navigate to the directory containing `dotslash-config.json` (e.g., `.github/workflows/dotslash-config.json`). Edit this file.
    3. **Inject Malicious Configuration:** Choose one of the injection methods:
        * **Malicious URL Injection:** Within the `outputs` section, locate a platform entry. If a `providers` section exists, modify the `url` in the first provider to `http://attacker.com/malicious-binary.tar.gz`. If no `providers` section exists or `exclude-http-provider` is false, manipulate the `asset["url"]` indirectly by modifying `regex` or `name` to match a dummy asset and control its URL in a release.
        * **Malicious Artifact Selection:** Modify the `regex` or `name` in a platform entry to match a different, malicious artifact in the release. For testing, you can upload a benign file as a "malicious artifact".
    4. **Create a Release (or trigger workflow):** Create a new release in your forked repository with assets that match the (potentially manipulated) configuration in `dotslash-config.json`. Alternatively, trigger the workflow that uses this action based on `on.workflow_run`. Ensure the workflow completes successfully.
    5. **Download the Generated DotSlash File:** After the action runs successfully, download the generated DotSlash file from the newly created release in your forked repository.
    6. **Execute the DotSlash File:** Run the downloaded DotSlash file on a test machine with `dotslash-cli` installed.
    7. **Verify Malicious Download:** Observe the network traffic or the behavior of the system. For URL injection, verify download from `http://attacker.com/malicious-binary.tar.gz`. For artifact selection, verify download of the "malicious artifact".

#### Vulnerability 2: Supply Chain Vulnerability via Propagation of Compromised Release Artifacts

* Description:
    1. An attacker compromises the GitHub workflow responsible for building and uploading the initial release artifacts. This could be achieved through various means such as compromised credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies, or supply chain attacks on workflow dependencies.
    2. The attacker modifies this workflow to inject malware into the executables or artifacts being built.
    3. The compromised workflow proceeds to build and upload these malware-infected executables as release artifacts to a GitHub release.
    4. The `dotslash-publish-release` GitHub Action is configured to run after the successful completion of the release artifact upload workflow. This is a typical setup to automatically generate DotSlash files upon a new release.
    5. The `dotslash-publish-release` action automatically triggers and fetches the release assets (which now include the malware-infected executables) from the GitHub release using the GitHub API.
    6. The action generates DotSlash files. These generated files are configured to download and execute the fetched release artifacts. Because the fetched artifacts are now malware-infected, the DotSlash files will inherently point to and distribute malware.
    7. The `dotslash-publish-release` action uploads these newly generated DotSlash files to the same GitHub release, making them readily available for users to download alongside the compromised release artifacts.
    8. Unsuspecting users download and execute the DotSlash files, believing them to be a safe and convenient way to install the software. However, the DotSlash files, in turn, download and execute the malware-infected executables from the GitHub release, compromising their systems.

* Impact: Users who download and use the generated DotSlash files will unknowingly download and execute malware, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. This constitutes a significant supply chain vulnerability as it allows for the distribution of malware through a seemingly legitimate and trusted distribution mechanism (DotSlash files from a trusted GitHub release).

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * **Hash Verification (in `dotslash-cli`):** The `process_config.py` script calculates a cryptographic hash (BLAKE3 or SHA256) of each downloaded release artifact using the `compute_hash` function. This hash is included in the generated DotSlash file. When a user uses `dotslash-cli` to install software via a DotSlash file, `dotslash-cli` verifies the hash of the downloaded artifact against the hash in the DotSlash file. This mechanism provides integrity checking of the artifacts *at the time of installation by the end-user*.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Trust in Upstream Workflows:** The `dotslash-publish-release` action implicitly trusts the integrity of the release artifacts provided by the upstream GitHub workflows. There is no mechanism within this action to validate the source or integrity of the release artifacts *before* generating the DotSlash files. The action assumes that if artifacts are present in the GitHub release, they are legitimate and safe.
    * **Lack of Artifact Provenance Verification:** The action does not implement any form of provenance verification for the release artifacts. It does not check for signatures, attestations (like Sigstore), or any other cryptographic proof that the artifacts were genuinely produced by the expected source and have not been tampered with before being included in the release. Implementing provenance verification would add a crucial layer of security by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the artifacts *before* they are incorporated into the DotSlash distribution.

* Preconditions:
    * **Compromised Release Workflow:** The primary precondition is that the GitHub workflow responsible for building and uploading the initial release artifacts must be compromised by an attacker.
    * **Successful Artifact Upload:** The compromised workflow must successfully upload the malware-infected artifacts to a GitHub release.
    * **`dotslash-publish-release` Action Configuration:** The `dotslash-publish-release` action must be configured to run *after* the workflow that uploads the release artifacts.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`process_config.py`:**
        * **`get_release_assets` function:** Fetches release assets using `gh release view --json assets`. It retrieves asset metadata (name, URL, size, etc.) from GitHub. No validation or integrity check is performed on these assets at this stage.

        ```python
        def get_release_assets(*, tag: str, github_repository):
            args = [
                "gh",
                "release",
                "view",
                tag,
                "--json",
                "assets",
                "--repo",
                github_repository,
            ]
            output = subprocess.check_output(args)
            release_data = json.loads(output.decode("utf-8"))
            return {asset["name"]: asset for asset in release_data["assets"]}
        ```
        * **`compute_hash` function:** Downloads a release asset using `gh release download` and computes its cryptographic hash. While this function performs hash calculation, it operates on artifacts that have already been uploaded to the release and potentially compromised.

        ```python
        def compute_hash(gh_repo_arg: str, temp_dir: str, tag: str, name: str, hash_algo: HashAlgorithm, size: int) -> str:
            asset_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, name)
            args = [
                "gh",
                "release",
                "download",
                tag,
                "-p",
                name,
                "-D",
                temp_dir,
                "--repo",
                gh_repo_arg,
            ]
            subprocess.check_output(args)
            asset_size = os.path.getsize(asset_path)
            if asset_size != size:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"downloaded asset size {asset_size} does not match release asset size {size}"
                )
            return hash_file(asset_path, hash_algo)
        ```
        * **`generate_manifest_file` function:** Constructs the DotSlash manifest file. It includes the artifact's URL, size, and the pre-computed hash. The manifest is generated based on whatever artifacts are present in the GitHub release *without* verifying their origin or integrity beyond calculating the hash of the already uploaded artifacts.

        * **Overall Flow:** The action retrieves release assets, iterates through configured outputs, maps platforms to assets, and generates manifest files. The vulnerability is that the action trusts the artifacts in the release without provenance checks.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a test GitHub repository and configure a workflow to build and release a simple executable artifact. Include the `dotslash-publish-release` action in `.github/workflows/dotslash.yml` to run after the release workflow.
    2. **Compromise Artifact:** In the release workflow, before the artifact upload step, modify the build process to inject a benign "malware" payload into the executable artifact (e.g., print a warning message).
    3. **Create Release:** Run the release workflow. This uploads the compromised artifact and triggers `dotslash-publish-release`.
    4. **Verify DotSlash File Generation:** Check the release for generated DotSlash files. Download one.
    5. **Execute DotSlash File:** Run the DotSlash file on a test machine.
    6. **Observe Malware Execution:** Observe the injected payload executing before the intended program, demonstrating distribution of the compromised artifact.
    7. **Hash Mitigation Check (Optional):** Modify the released artifact on GitHub (if possible, or simulate locally). Run `dotslash-cli` against the DotSlash file. It should fail with a hash mismatch, showing hash verification detects *post-generation* tampering but doesn't prevent initial propagation of compromised artifacts.
