### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Configuration File Injection leading to Malicious Binary Distribution
* Description:
    1. An attacker gains write access to the repository, for example, by compromising a maintainer's account or through a malicious pull request that gets merged.
    2. The attacker modifies the `dotslash-config.json` file within the repository. This file dictates how DotSlash files are generated.
    3. In the modified `dotslash-config.json`, the attacker changes the download `url` within a platform entry to point to a malicious binary hosted on an attacker-controlled server, or modifies the `digest` to match a malicious binary they will upload to the release.
    4. When the GitHub Action `dotslash-publish-release` runs (triggered by a new release or workflow completion), it reads the compromised `dotslash-config.json`.
    5. The action generates a DotSlash file based on the attacker's modified configuration, embedding the malicious download URL and potentially manipulated hash.
    6. Users who download and execute the generated DotSlash file will unknowingly download and execute the malicious binary from the attacker-controlled server, instead of the intended legitimate software.
* Impact:
    * **Critical:** Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the machines of users who download and use the DotSlash files generated by this GitHub Action. This represents a supply chain attack, as users are tricked into downloading malware through a seemingly trusted source (the legitimate software release).
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None in the provided code. The action processes the configuration file and generates DotSlash files without any validation of the URLs or other critical parameters within the configuration.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input Validation for `dotslash-config.json`:** The action should validate the contents of the `dotslash-config.json` file. Specifically:
        * **URL Validation:**  Restrict URLs to only originate from trusted domains, such as `github.com` or the official domain of the software project. Sanitize and validate URLs to prevent injection of arbitrary URLs.
        * **Hash Validation (less critical in this action, more relevant in dotslash-cli):** While this action calculates hashes, it doesn't validate the *source* of truth for these hashes. Ideally, there should be a mechanism to ensure the configured hashes are also from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with in the configuration.
    * **Content Integrity Check for `dotslash-config.json`:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the `dotslash-config.json` file itself. This could involve signing the configuration file or using branch protection and code review processes to minimize the risk of unauthorized modifications.
* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs write access to the repository to modify the `dotslash-config.json` file.
    * The GitHub Action workflow must be triggered after the malicious modification.
    * Users must download and execute the generated DotSlash file.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`action.yml`:** Defines the action, taking `config` as input which is the path to `dotslash-config.json`.
    2. **`process_config.py`:**
        * `parse_args()`: Parses command-line arguments, including `--config`, which specifies the path to the configuration file.
        * `get_config()`: Reads and parses the `dotslash-config.json` file. It fetches the config file content using `gh api` but doesn't perform any validation on the content itself.
        ```python
        def get_config(
            *, path_to_config: str, config_ref: str, github_repository: str, api_url: str
        ) -> Any:
            args = [
                "gh",
                "api",
                "-X",
                "GET",
                f"{api_url}/repos/{github_repository}/contents/{path_to_config}",
                "-H",
                "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw",
                "-f",
                f"ref={config_ref}",
            ]
            output = subprocess.check_output(args)
            return json.loads(output.decode("utf-8"))
        ```
        * `generate_manifest_file()`: This function generates the content of the DotSlash file. It takes `platform_entries` as input, which are derived directly from the parsed `dotslash-config.json`. The function embeds the `url` from the asset (obtained from GitHub release assets, which are indirectly influenced by `dotslash-config.json` through regex or name matching) and other parameters into the DotSlash manifest without validating the origin or safety of the URLs.
        ```python
        def generate_manifest_file(
            name: str,
            gh_repo_arg: str,
            tag: str,
            platform_entries,
            include_http_provider: bool,
            include_github_release_provider: bool,
        ) -> str:
            # ...
            providers = []
            if include_http_provider:
                providers.append(
                    {
                        "url": asset["url"], # URL from github release asset, indirectly from config
                    }
                )
            # ...
            artifact_entry = {
                # ...
                "providers": providers,
            }
            # ...
        ```
        * **No URL validation or sanitization is performed anywhere in the script.** It directly uses the values from the parsed JSON configuration to construct the DotSlash file.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the repository containing this GitHub Action.
    2. **Modify `dotslash-config.json`:** In your forked repository, navigate to the directory containing `dotslash-config.json` (e.g., `.github/workflows/dotslash-config.json`). Edit this file.
    3. **Inject Malicious URL:** Within the `outputs` section, locate a platform entry (e.g., `linux-x86_64`). Modify the `providers` section (if present, otherwise the action creates it based on asset URL) or manipulate the asset matching logic (`regex` or `name`) and the resulting `asset["url"]` in `generate_manifest_file` to inject a malicious URL. For example, replace the legitimate `url` with `http://attacker.com/malicious-binary.tar.gz`. If `providers` section exists and `exclude-http-provider` is false or not set, then the first provider will be used, so modify the `url` in the first provider. If `providers` section doesn't exist, the `asset["url"]` is used directly, so you need to manipulate asset matching to control this URL. For simplicity, assuming the action uses asset URL, manipulate the regex to match a dummy asset and control its URL in the release.
    4. **Create a Release (or trigger workflow):** Create a new release in your forked repository with assets that match the modified configuration in `dotslash-config.json`. Alternatively, trigger the workflow that uses this action based on the `on.workflow_run` trigger if you have control over the triggering workflow. Ensure the workflow completes successfully.
    5. **Download the Generated DotSlash File:** After the action runs successfully, download the generated DotSlash file from the newly created release in your forked repository. The name of the DotSlash file will be as defined in the `outputs` section of `dotslash-config.json`.
    6. **Execute the DotSlash File:** Run the downloaded DotSlash file on a test machine.
    7. **Verify Malicious Download:** Observe the network traffic or the behavior of the system. You should see that the DotSlash file attempts to download the binary from `http://attacker.com/malicious-binary.tar.gz` (or the URL you injected) instead of the legitimate release asset. If the malicious binary is designed to execute a reverse shell or other malicious activity, you should observe that behavior as well.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage a compromised `dotslash-config.json` to distribute malicious binaries through the DotSlash mechanism, highlighting the critical vulnerability.
