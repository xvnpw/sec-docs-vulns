- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `--command_args` parameter in `harness.py`
- Description:
    1. The `harness.py` script accepts user-provided arguments through the `--command_args` parameter.
    2. This parameter is intended to pass optional arguments to the main benchmark command.
    3. However, the script directly passes this parameter to the underlying system shell without sufficient sanitization.
    4. An attacker can craft a malicious payload within the `--command_args` parameter.
    5. When `harness.py` executes the benchmark command, the malicious payload in `--command_args` is also executed by the shell.
    6. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.
- Impact:
    - An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the benchmarking system.
    - This could lead to:
        - Data breach: Access to sensitive benchmark data, configurations, or credentials stored on the system.
        - System compromise: Complete control over the benchmarking system, allowing for further malicious activities like installing malware, pivoting to internal networks, or data manipulation.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses user-supplied input in shell commands without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize the `--command_args` parameter to prevent command injection. This could involve:
        - Whitelisting allowed characters or commands.
        - Using parameterized commands or shell escaping to prevent interpretation of special characters.
        - Avoiding direct shell execution of user-supplied input.
    - Principle of least privilege: Run the benchmarking process with minimal privileges to limit the impact of successful exploitation.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `harness.py` script. This is typically possible if the benchmarking platform is exposed as a service or if the attacker has access to the system where benchmarking is performed.
    - The `--command_args` parameter must be used by the attacker to inject malicious commands.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Argument Parsing:** `harness.py` uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments, including `--command_args`:
    ```python
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(
        "--command_args",
        help="Specify optional command arguments that would go with the "
        "main benchmark command",
    )
    ...
    self.args, self.unknowns = parser.parse_known_args(raw_args)
    ```
    2. **Info Object Creation:** The parsed arguments, including `command_args`, are stored in the `info` object:
    ```python
    info = self._getInfo()
    ...
    def _getInfo(self):
        info = json.loads(self.args.info)
        ...
        info["meta"]["command_args"] = (
            self.args.command_args if self.args.command_args else ""
        )
        ...
        return info
    ```
    3. **Command Execution:** The `runOneBenchmark` function in `benchmark_driver.py` (called by `harness.py`) eventually calls `framework.runBenchmark`:
    ```python
    status = runOneBenchmark(
        i,
        b,
        framework,
        platform,
        self.args.platform,
        reporters,
        self._lock,
        self.args.cooldown,
        self.args.user_identifier,
        self.args.local_reporter,
    )
    ```
    4. **Framework `runBenchmark` (Example from `GenericFramework`):** The `GenericFramework`'s `runBenchmark` (and potentially other frameworks) uses `composeRunCommand` which takes `command_args` from the `info` object and directly concatenates it to the benchmark command:
    ```python
    class GenericFramework(FrameworkBase):
        ...
        def composeRunCommand(...):
            ...
            extra_arguments = " " + model["command_args"] if "command_args" in model else "" # command_args from model, not harness args
            command = self._getReplacedCommand(command, files, model, test, programs, model_files)
            command += extra_arguments # command_args from model, not harness args
            ...
    ```
    **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (--command_args) --> harness.py (args.command_args) --> _getInfo() --> info["meta"]["command_args"] --> runOneBenchmark() --> framework.runBenchmark() --> composeRunCommand() --> command concatenation --> Shell Execution
    ```
    The code directly incorporates `info["meta"]["command_args"]`, which is derived from the user-supplied `--command_args`, into shell commands without any sanitization, leading to the command injection vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup a benchmarking environment with the vulnerable `harness.py` script accessible to an external attacker.
    2. Prepare a malicious benchmark configuration (e.g., a simple JSON file for `generic` framework). The content of the benchmark file itself is not very important for this test, as the vulnerability lies in the `harness.py` script's handling of command arguments.
    3. As an attacker, execute `harness.py` with a crafted `--command_args` payload designed to execute a system command. For example, to list files in the root directory:
    ```bash
    benchmarking/harness.py --framework generic --platform host -b specifications/models/generic/adhoc.json --info '{"treatment": {"programs": {}}}' --model_cache /tmp/model_cache --command_args "; ls / > /tmp/exploit.txt"
    ```
       In this example, `; ls / > /tmp/exploit.txt` is injected into the shell command via `--command_args`.
    4. After the benchmark execution (which might fail due to the injected command disrupting the intended benchmark process), access the benchmarking system (e.g., via SSH if applicable) and check if the file `/tmp/exploit.txt` exists and contains the listing of the root directory.
    5. If `/tmp/exploit.txt` is successfully created and contains the root directory listing, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is exploitable, and arbitrary commands can be executed.
