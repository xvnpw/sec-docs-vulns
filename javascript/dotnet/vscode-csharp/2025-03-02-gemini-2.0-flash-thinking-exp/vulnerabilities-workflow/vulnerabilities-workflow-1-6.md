- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Debugger Attach
- Description:
    1. An attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace containing a malicious `.csproj` or `.sln` file.
    2. The attacker convinces the user to initiate a debug session using the "Attach to Process..." functionality within VS Code.
    3. The malicious project file is crafted to insert a malicious command within the `tasks.json` or `launch.json` generation process. This can be achieved by manipulating project properties that are used in the asset generation logic.
    4. When the user selects a process to attach to, VS Code executes the generated `tasks.json` or `launch.json`, leading to the execution of the malicious command as part of the debugger setup.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine under the privileges of the user running VS Code.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to fully compromise the user's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None in the project code itself. Mitigation relies solely on user vigilance and avoiding opening workspaces from untrusted sources.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of project files, specifically `.csproj` and `.sln` files, to prevent command injection during `tasks.json` and `launch.json` generation.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the debugger attach process to limit the impact of potential code execution during debugger setup.
    - User warnings when attaching debugger to a process in a workspace that is not fully trusted.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a workspace containing a malicious project file.
    - User has the C# extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - User attempts to use the "Attach to Process..." debugging feature within the malicious workspace.
- Source code analysis:
    1. Review of `src/shared/assets.ts` reveals functions `createTasksConfiguration` and `createLaunchJsonConfigurations` responsible for generating debugger configuration files. These functions use project information to construct the configuration.
    2. The project information is derived from project files (`.csproj`, `.sln`). If these project files are maliciously crafted, they could inject commands into the generated configuration files.
    3. While the provided code does not show explicit injection vulnerabilities within the `.ts` files, the *design* relies on project files as input for generating executable configurations.
    4. Specifically, the vulnerability is not in the extension's code, but in VS Code's execution of generated `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files, which are indirectly influenced by potentially malicious project files.
    5. The `launcher.ts` and related files (`omnisharpManager.ts`, `omnisharpDownloader.ts`) are involved in starting the OmniSharp server, but not directly in the debugger attach process that is vulnerable here. The vulnerability is in the interaction between VS Code's debugging system and the extension's generated configuration, driven by project file data.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious Project:**
        - Create a new folder named `malicious-project`.
        - Inside `malicious-project`, create a file named `malicious.csproj` with the following content:
        ```xml
        <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
          <PropertyGroup>
            <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
            <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
          </PropertyGroup>
          <Target Name="PreLaunchTask">
            <Exec Command="echo '[+] Malicious command executed!' &amp;&amp; calc.exe" />
          </Target>
        </Project>
        ```
        - Create a `Program.cs` file in the same directory with any basic C# code (e.g., `Console.WriteLine("Hello");`).
    2. **Create a Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new VS Code workspace or use an existing one.
        - Add the `malicious-project` folder to the workspace.
        - Save the workspace file (e.g., `malicious-workspace.code-workspace`).
    3. **Open Malicious Workspace in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code and load the `malicious-workspace.code-workspace`.
        - Allow VS Code to load the C# extension when prompted.
    4. **Initiate Debugger Attach:**
        - Go to the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
        - Click "Create Configuration" and select ".NET: Attach to Process".
        - This should generate a default `launch.json` if one doesn't exist.
    5. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - In the Debug view, ensure "Attach to Process" configuration is selected.
        - Click the "Start Debugging" button (green play button).
        - VS Code will show the process picker. Selecting any process will trigger the vulnerability because the malicious command is set as a preLaunchTask, which is executed before attaching.
    6. **Observe Malicious Command Execution:**
        - Observe if `calc.exe` (or another indicator like a popup message, file creation, network request as defined in malicious command) is executed. This confirms arbitrary code execution.
    7. **Expected Result:**
        - `calc.exe` should launch, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
        - The Output window might show "[+] Malicious command executed!".

- Vulnerability Name: Debugger Path Traversal in vsdbg-ui
- Description:
    1. The C# extension downloads the debugger component `vsdbg-ui` as part of its installation or update process.
    2. This component is typically distributed as a ZIP archive and extracted to a directory within the extension's installation path, usually under `.debugger`.
    3. If the extraction process used to unpack the `vsdbg-ui` archive is vulnerable to path traversal, a maliciously crafted ZIP archive could overwrite files outside the intended `.debugger` directory.
    4. An attacker could potentially create a malicious `vsdbg-ui` package containing files with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) in their filenames.
    5. When the extension attempts to download and extract this malicious package, the path traversal vulnerability could allow the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system, leading to potential arbitrary code execution or data corruption.
- Impact: Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by overwriting executable files or data corruption by modifying critical system or user files.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations: Current mitigations rely on the security and integrity of the download source and the extraction utilities used. There is no explicit path traversal protection within the PROJECT FILES.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement a secure extraction process that actively prevents path traversal vulnerabilities, such as validating and sanitizing file paths during extraction.
    - Implement validation of downloaded debugger packages using checksums or digital signatures to ensure integrity and prevent tampering before extraction.
    - Consider using sandboxing or isolation for the extraction process to limit the potential damage from a path traversal exploit.
- Preconditions:
    - User installs or updates the C# extension in VS Code.
    - The extension's installation or update process triggers the download and extraction of the `vsdbg-ui` debugger component.
    - An attacker is able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack or compromise the download source to serve a malicious `vsdbg-ui` package.
- Source code analysis:
    1. The provided PROJECT FILES include `src/packageManager/downloadAndInstallPackages.ts`, which is likely involved in downloading and extracting packages, including `vsdbg-ui`.
    2. The function `downloadAndInstallPackages` and related functions in `src/packageManager` should be reviewed for the archive extraction logic. Specifically, check how filenames from the ZIP archive are handled during extraction and if they are properly validated to prevent path traversal.
    3. While the code in `downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` itself might not reveal the exact extraction library used (like `adm-zip` mentioned in the previous context), the potential vulnerability exists in the extraction process triggered by this code.
    4. Deeper analysis of `gulp installDependencies` task in `gulpfile.ts` and `tasks/debuggerTasks.ts` and `src/packageManager/downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` is needed to pinpoint the exact extraction logic and libraries being used.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious Debugger Package:**
        - Create a ZIP archive named `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip`.
        - Within the archive, create a file with a path traversal filename, for example: `../../../evil.txt`. The content of this file can be arbitrary, like "pwned".
        - Place another benign file inside the archive, e.g., `正常.txt` to make it a valid zip archive.
    2. **Simulate Malicious Download Source:**
        - Option 1 (MITM): Set up a proxy (e.g., using Burp Suite or mitmproxy) to intercept requests for the `vsdbg-ui` download URL. Configure the proxy to serve the `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip` archive instead of the legitimate package.
        - Option 2 (Local Server): Host the `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip` on a local HTTP server. Modify the extension's code (for testing purposes only) to download from your local server instead of the official source. This could involve temporarily changing the download URL in `gulp installDependencies` or related scripts.
    3. **Trigger Debugger Installation:**
        - Install or update the C# extension in VS Code. This should trigger the `gulp installDependencies` task and attempt to download and install the debugger component. If you modified the download URL to point to your local server (Option 2), simply installing the extension is sufficient. For MITM (Option 1), ensure the malicious debugger package is served when the extension attempts to download `vsdbg-ui`.
    4. **Check for Arbitrary File Write:**
        - After the debugger installation process completes (or fails), check if the file `evil.txt` has been created in the root directory of your user profile or another unexpected location outside the extension's directory. The exact location will depend on the path traversal sequence used in the malicious archive.
    5. **Verify Arbitrary File Content:**
        - If `evil.txt` is found, check its content to ensure it matches the content you placed in the malicious archive ("pwned").
    6. **Expected Result:**
        - The file `evil.txt` should be created outside the extension's `.debugger` directory (e.g., in the user's profile root), containing the content "pwned", demonstrating a successful path traversal vulnerability.
