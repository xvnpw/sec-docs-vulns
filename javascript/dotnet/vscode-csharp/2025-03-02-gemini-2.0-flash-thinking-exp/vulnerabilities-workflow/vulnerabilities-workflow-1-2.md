- Vulnerability Name: Language Middleware Injection in Remap Function
  - Description:
    1. An external attacker can register a malicious Language Middleware by calling the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command with crafted middleware.
    2. This middleware can implement the `remapWorkspaceEdit` and `remapLocations` functions.
    3. When the `remap` function in `LanguageMiddlewareFeature` is called with a `remapType` (e.g., 'remapWorkspaceEdit' or 'remapLocations'), it iterates through the registered middlewares.
    4. For each middleware, it retrieves the corresponding method (e.g., `middleware.remapWorkspaceEdit`) and calls it using `method.call(middleware, remapped, token)`.
    5. Because the middleware is provided by an external source (via `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command), a malicious middleware can inject arbitrary code or manipulate the `workspaceEdit` or `locations` objects during the remapping process, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure depending on how the remapped objects are used later.
  - Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary code execution within the extension's context or manipulation of workspace edits/locations, potentially leading to malicious modifications of user code or information disclosure.
  - Vulnerability Rank: high
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project currently lacks input validation or sanitization of the registered middleware and its methods.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the middleware object and its functions registered via `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command.
    - Consider restricting middleware registration to only trusted sources or implementing a secure mechanism for middleware management.
  - Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to trigger the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command. This command is registered using `vscode.commands.registerCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', ...)` which is generally intended for extension developers to register middleware. However, if an attacker can somehow trigger this command (e.g., via a crafted extension or a vulnerability in the extension host), they could register malicious middleware.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/omnisharp/languageMiddlewareFeature.ts

    public register(): void {
        this._registration = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
            'omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware',
            (middleware: LanguageMiddleware) => { // [Potential Vulnerability Point] Middleware object is directly pushed to _middlewares array
                this._middlewares.push(middleware);
            }
        );
    }

    public async remap<M extends keyof RemapApi, P extends RemapParameterType<M>>(
        remapType: M,
        original: P,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): Promise<P> {
        try {
            const languageMiddlewares = this.getLanguageMiddlewares();
            let remapped = original;

            for (const middleware of languageMiddlewares) {
                // Commit a type crime because we know better than the compiler
                const method = <(p: P, c: vscode.CancellationToken) => vscode.ProviderResult<P>>middleware[remapType]; // [Potential Vulnerability Point] Method from middleware is retrieved without validation
                if (!method) {
                    continue;
                }

                const result = await method.call(middleware, remapped, token); // [Vulnerability Trigger] Method from external middleware is called with user-controlled data (original)
                if (result) {
                    remapped = result;
                }
            }

            return remapped;
        } catch (_) {
            // Something happened while remapping. Return the original.
            return original;
        }
    }
    ```

                                        For each middleware in _middlewares:
                                          |
                                          V
                                        method = middleware[remapType]
                                          |
                                          V
                                        result = method.call(middleware, remapped, token) --> [Malicious Middleware Code Execution]
                                          |
                                          V
                                        Return remapped
      ```
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious VS Code extension.
    2. In the extension's `extension.ts`, register a language middleware that intercepts `remapWorkspaceEdit`. This middleware should contain malicious code, for example, writing to a file in the user's workspace or exfiltrating data.
    3. Use `vscode.commands.executeCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', maliciousMiddleware)` to register the middleware.
    4. Trigger a code action or refactoring in a C# file that utilizes the `LanguageMiddlewareFeature.remap` function with 'remapWorkspaceEdit' type (e.g., rename).
    5. Observe if the malicious code in the registered middleware is executed (e.g., check for the file written by the malicious middleware or monitor network traffic for data exfiltration).
    6. Rank: High, because it allows for arbitrary code execution within the extension context, which could lead to significant compromise.
