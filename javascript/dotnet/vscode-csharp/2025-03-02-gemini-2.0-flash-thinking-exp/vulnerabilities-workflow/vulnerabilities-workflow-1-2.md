- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Download of Dependencies in Build Pipeline

- Description:
    1. The `azure-pipelines.yml` and `azure-pipelines-official.yml` files define the CI/CD pipeline for building and testing the C# extension.
    2. The pipeline includes steps to download and install dependencies using `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies`.
    3. `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies` rely on package manifests (package.json, gulpfile.ts) which can specify external dependencies hosted on public repositories (like npmjs.com) or internal feeds.
    4. If these dependencies are compromised (e.g., through dependency confusion attacks or account hijacking), the build process could be poisoned.
    5. A compromised dependency could introduce malicious code into the extension, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on developer machines during build or user machines upon extension installation.

- Impact:
    - Compromised Build Pipeline: If malicious code is injected through compromised dependencies, official builds of the C# extension could be backdoored.
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: A threat actor could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on developer machines running the build pipeline or on user machines installing a compromised extension.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `azure-pipelines.yml` includes a step `vsts-npm-auth` which is used to authenticate against Azure DevOps Artifacts feed. This mitigates some risk by ensuring that internal packages are fetched from a controlled source.
    - `codecov.yml` is used for coverage reporting. It indicates code coverage analysis, not directly a mitigation but good practice.
    - `azure-pipelines-official.yml` uses 1ESPipelineTemplates which presumably include security best practices and policies.
    - `azure-pipelines.yml` has scheduled builds for testing, which could detect anomalies introduced by compromised dependencies over time.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Dependency checking: The project does not seem to have any explicit checks for dependency integrity (e.g., using `npm audit`, dependency vulnerability scanning, or verifying checksums of downloaded dependencies beyond the `integrity` field in package-lock.json or similar).
    - Supply chain security hardening: There is no clear evidence of supply chain security hardening practices like Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation or signing of generated artifacts (JS code, VSIX) to verify origin and integrity beyond manifest signing for marketplace submission. Although VSIX signing is mentioned, it's focused on marketplace requirements, not necessarily supply chain integrity for local builds.
    - Subresource Integrity (SRI): For webview components or any external resources loaded at runtime, Subresource Integrity (SRI) is not mentioned, which could protect against CDN compromises. However, this is less relevant for backend components of VS Code extensions.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to compromise a dependency used by the project, either in the public npm registry or in the private Azure DevOps Artifacts feed.
    - The build pipeline must execute the compromised code (e.g., during `npm install` or `gulp installDependencies`).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azure-pipelines.yml`, `/code/azure-pipelines-official.yml`, `/code/gulpfile.ts`, `/code/esbuild.js`, `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `/code/src/tools/README.md`
    - The build pipeline definition files (`azure-pipelines.yml`, `azure-pipelines-official.yml`) show that `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies` are executed.
    - `gulpfile.ts` defines gulp tasks including `installDependencies`, indicating usage of gulp for build automation and dependency management.
    - `esbuild.js` shows the use of `esbuild` for bundling, implying a complex build process that relies on npm dependencies.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructs developers to run `npm install` and `gulp`, reinforcing the use of these tools in the development workflow.
    - `/code/src/tools/README.md` mentions `npm run gulp generateOptionsSchema`, highlighting a specific build script execution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Identify a dependency used in `package.json` or by `gulp installDependencies`. For example, `vsts-npm-auth` used in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
        - Create a malicious version of this dependency that, for example, writes a file to disk during installation.
        - Host this malicious dependency in a private npm registry or a local server that mimics npm registry behavior.
        - Modify `.npmrc` in the PROJECT_FILES to point to your malicious registry *for testing purposes only*.
    2. **Trigger Build:**
        - In a local development environment, run `npm install` followed by `gulp installDependencies` as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    3. **Observe:**
        - Check if the malicious code from the compromised dependency executes during the build process (e.g., by verifying the creation of the file written by the malicious dependency).
    4. **Cleanup:**
        - Restore the original `.npmrc` file to point to the legitimate npm registry.
        - Delete any files created by the malicious dependency during the test.

Mitigation Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    - Implement a dependency vulnerability check step in the pipeline (e.g., using `npm audit` or a dedicated vulnerability scanning tool).
    - Configure the pipeline to fail if vulnerabilities are found above a certain severity level.
2. **Trigger Build:**
    - Introduce a known vulnerable dependency into `package.json` (for testing purposes only).
    - Run the Azure Pipeline (PR or CI build).
3. **Observe:**
    - Verify that the vulnerability check step in the pipeline detects the vulnerable dependency and fails the build.
