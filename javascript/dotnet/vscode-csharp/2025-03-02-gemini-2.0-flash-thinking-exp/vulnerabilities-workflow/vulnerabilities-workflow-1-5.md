### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name**: Insecure npm package authorization configuration

- **Description**:
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to use `vsts-npm-auth` and `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` to configure credentials for accessing the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed. While this is intended for internal contributors, improper handling or misconfiguration could lead to inadvertently committing credentials to the repository or exposing them. Additionally, the `.npmrc` file itself, if not properly secured, could be a target for attackers if it contains sensitive information.

- **Impact**:
Exposure of credentials to the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to internal packages or compromise the integrity of the build/release process if credentials are used maliciously.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
The documentation in `CONTRIBUTING.md` is intended for developers setting up a local development environment and does not directly affect production code. However, there are no explicit mitigations within the project itself to prevent developers from accidentally committing `.npmrc` files or secure handling of credentials.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
The project should include:
    - A `.gitignore` entry for `.npmrc` to prevent accidental commits.
    - Security guidelines for developers to ensure proper handling and storage of credentials, emphasizing not to commit credentials to the repository.
    - Consider using environment variables or a more secure credential management system instead of `.npmrc` where possible.

- **Preconditions**:
    - A developer follows the `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions and runs `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    - The developer works in an environment where they have access to the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed and obtains valid credentials.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
```markdown
File: /code/CONTRIBUTING.md
Content:
...
1. Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`, then run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` - This command will configure your credentials for the next command.
   a.  If you have already authenticated before, but the token expired, you may need to run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f` instead.
...
```
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` explicitly instructs developers to create a `.npmrc` file with credentials. This file, if not ignored, could be committed to source control or otherwise inadvertently exposed.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. Initialize a git repository in a local directory.
    2. Clone the vscode-csharp repository into this local directory.
    3. Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to setup npm authentication, including running `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    4. Check the git status (`git status`) and observe that `.npmrc` is listed as an untracked file, but not ignored.
    5. (Optional, simulate accidental commit): Stage and commit the `.npmrc` file (`git add .npmrc`, `git commit -m "Accidentally committed npmrc"`).
    6. (Observe): While this test case highlights a documentation issue and potential for developer error, it does not expose a direct vulnerability in the extension's code but in the project's contribution process. The risk is more about developer best practices than a vulnerability in the software itself.
