### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Insecure VSTS NPM Registry Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure VSTS NPM Registry Configuration
- **Description:** The project uses an Azure DevOps Artifacts feed for npm package management, configured via `vsts-npm-auth`. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to authenticate using `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`. If the resulting `.npmrc` file, which may contain authentication tokens, is unintentionally committed to a public repository, it could expose sensitive credentials. An attacker could then use these credentials to access the private feed, potentially leading to data breaches or supply chain attacks by injecting malicious packages.
- **Impact:** High. Exposure of credentials allowing unauthorized access to a private Azure DevOps Artifacts feed, potentially enabling data breaches or supply chain attacks.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the project files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Update:** The `CONTRIBUTING.md` should be updated with a clear and strong warning against committing the `.npmrc` file to version control, especially public repositories. It should emphasize that this file contains sensitive authentication information.
    - **Secure Credential Management:** The build process should be re-evaluated to avoid relying on local `.npmrc` files for authentication in CI/CD environments. Consider using secure credential injection mechanisms provided by CI/CD platforms instead.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Developers follow the `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions.
    - The generated `.npmrc` file contains sensitive credentials.
    - The `.npmrc` file is accidentally or intentionally committed to a publicly accessible repository.
    - An attacker discovers and extracts the credentials from the committed `.npmrc` file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`
    - ```markdown
      1. Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`, then run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` - This command will configure your credentials for the next command.
    ```
    - The documentation encourages generating and potentially committing `.npmrc`, which is a security risk if credentials are included.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a private GitHub repository.
        - Clone the `vscode-csharp` repository locally.
        - Navigate to the cloned `vscode-csharp` directory in the terminal.
        - Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`.
        - Run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    2. **Verification:**
        - Inspect the generated `.npmrc` file in the root directory. Verify that it contains authentication details, such as tokens or credentials, for the Azure DevOps Artifacts feed (`dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com`).
        - Add and commit the `.npmrc` file to the private GitHub repository:
          ```bash
          git add .npmrc
          git commit -m "Commit .npmrc with VSTS auth config (simulating accidental commit)"
          ```
        - Make the repository public (to simulate public exposure).
    3. **Exploitation Simulation (Attacker Perspective):**
        - Clone the now public repository to a separate attacker machine or user account.
        - Inspect the `.npmrc` file in the cloned repository.
        - Attempt to use the credentials in the `.npmrc` to access the VSTS npm registry. For instance, try to install a package using `npm install --registry=https://dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com/public/_packaging/dotnet-public-npm/npm/registry/ some-dummy-package --userconfig .npmrc`.
        - If the command succeeds without prompting for further authentication, it confirms that the credentials in `.npmrc` grant access to the feed.

#### Vulnerability 2: Command Injection in OmniSharp Server Launch

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in OmniSharp Server Launch
- **Description:** The `launchWindows` and `launchNixMono` functions in `/code/src/omnisharp/launcher.ts` construct shell commands using `spawn` and `cmd /c` on Windows. Specifically, the `launchWindows` function uses `cmd /c` to execute the OmniSharp server, and it constructs the command string by concatenating arguments, including the `launchPath` and `args` array. If any of the elements in the `args` array, which are derived from configuration settings or project files, contain shell- Metacharacters and are not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection. An attacker who can control these configuration settings or project files could inject arbitrary commands into the OmniSharp server launch process.
- **Impact:** High. Arbitrary command execution on the server machine. An attacker could gain full control over the machine where the OmniSharp server is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks on the internal network.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the provided code. The code uses `escapeIfNeeded` function in `launchWindows` which escapes `&` but might not be sufficient to prevent all command injection scenarios.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all arguments passed to `spawn` and `cmd /c`, especially the `launchPath` and elements in the `args` array.  Use parameterized execution or shell-escaping mechanisms that are proven to be secure against command injection for the target shell (`cmd` on Windows, `bash` or `mono` on Linux/macOS).
    - **Avoid `cmd /c`:**  On Windows, avoid using `cmd /c` to execute commands. Use direct execution via `spawn` with an array of arguments, which generally avoids shell interpretation and command injection risks, or use `windowsVerbatimArguments: true` with `cmd`.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker can influence the configuration settings that contribute to the `args` array used to launch the OmniSharp server. This could be through poisoning project files or manipulating VS Code settings if those settings are not securely handled.
    - The OmniSharp server is launched using a vulnerable configuration.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/omnisharp/launcher.ts`
    - Function: `launchWindows`
    ```typescript
    function launchWindows(launchPath: string, cwd: string, args: string[]): IntermediateLaunchResult {
        function escapeIfNeeded(arg: string) {
            const hasSpaceWithoutQuotes = /^[^"].* .*[^"]/;
            return hasSpaceWithoutQuotes.test(arg) ? `"${arg}"` : arg.replace('&', '^&');
        }

        let argsCopy = args.slice(0); // create copy of args
        argsCopy.unshift(`"${launchPath}"`);
        argsCopy = [['/s', '/c', '"' + argsCopy.map(escapeIfNeeded).join(' ') + '"'].join(' ')];

        const process = spawn('cmd', argsCopy, {
            windowsVerbatimArguments: true,
            detached: false,
            cwd: cwd,
        });
    ```
    - The code uses `cmd /c` to execute the command on Windows. The `escapeIfNeeded` function attempts to escape arguments, but it's unclear if it's sufficient for all injection scenarios. The use of `windowsVerbatimArguments: true` might help, but the overall approach of constructing shell commands from potentially untrusted inputs is inherently risky.
    - Function: `launchNixMono`
    ```typescript
    function launchNixMono(
        launchPath: string,
        cwd: string,
        args: string[],
        environment: NodeJS.ProcessEnv
    ): ChildProcessWithoutNullStreams {
        const process = spawn('mono', args, {
            detached: false,
            cwd: cwd,
            env: environment,
        });

        return process;
    }
    ```
    - The `launchNixMono` function uses `spawn('mono', args, ...)` on Linux/macOS. While using an array for arguments is generally safer than constructing a string command, it's still crucial to ensure that the `args` array is properly sanitized, especially if any elements are derived from user-controlled or external sources.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Modify the project's configuration (e.g., `omnisharp.json` or VS Code settings) to introduce a malicious argument. For example, if the server accepts arguments via a configuration file, inject an argument like `--something="; malicious_command; "`. Alternatively, if the launch arguments are constructed based on project file names, create a project file with a name containing shell metacharacters.
    2. **Trigger Server Launch:**
        - Open a C# project in VS Code to trigger the OmniSharp server launch.
    3. **Exploitation Attempt (Windows):**
        - Observe if the injected command is executed by inspecting the running processes or by redirecting command output to a file. For example, inject an argument that creates a file in a known location (`--logfile="C:\temp\pwned.txt"`).
    4. **Exploitation Attempt (Linux/macOS):**
        - Similarly, on Linux/macOS, inject arguments that attempt to execute commands (e.g., using backticks or `$(...)`) and check for signs of command execution. For example, inject an argument that attempts to write to a file (`--logfile=/tmp/pwned.txt`).
    5. **Verification:**
        - Check if the injected command was successfully executed. For example, verify if the file `C:\temp\pwned.txt` or `/tmp/pwned.txt` was created, or if a process with the injected command was spawned. If successful, this confirms the command injection vulnerability.
