### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in dotnet restore command

- Description:
  1. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` and `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f`.
  2. These commands, if executed in an untrusted directory, could lead to the execution of a malicious `.npmrc` file if one is present in that directory.
  3. An attacker could place a malicious `.npmrc` file in a public repository.
  4. A developer cloning this repository and following the contributing guide could inadvertently execute the malicious `.npmrc` by running the suggested commands.

- Impact:
  - An attacker could potentially steal developer credentials or compromise the developer's environment through a malicious `.npmrc` file. This could lead to supply chain attacks or unauthorized access.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The project documentation explicitly instructs users to run these commands.

- Missing mitigations:
  - The documentation should be updated to warn users about the potential risks of running `vsts-npm-auth` in untrusted directories.
  - Consider removing the explicit instructions to run `vsts-npm-auth` in the contributing guide and instead rely on `npm install` to trigger authentication.
  - Security analysis of `vsts-npm-auth` to determine if it is vulnerable to local configuration file inclusion attacks.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer clones a repository containing a malicious `.npmrc` file.
  - The developer follows the "Setting Up Local Development Environment" instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - The developer executes `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth` and then `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` or `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f` in the cloned repository's root.

- Source code analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not in the project's source code itself but rather in the instructions provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- Security test case:
  1. Create a malicious `.npmrc` file containing code to exfiltrate environment variables or other sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server.
  2. Create a public GitHub repository and add the malicious `.npmrc` file to the root directory.
  3. Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of this repository to include the standard development setup instructions from the original project, specifically mentioning the `vsts-npm-auth` commands.
  4. As a test user, clone the malicious repository.
  5. Follow the setup instructions in the modified `CONTRIBUTING.md` and execute `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth` and then `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
  6. Observe if the malicious code in `.npmrc` is executed.
  7. Verify if exfiltrated data is received on the attacker-controlled server.

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in test execution and project restore commands

- Description:
  1. The `gulp installDependencies` command, used in the build process and documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, relies on `npm` and `vsts-npm-auth`.
  2. If the environment or any dependency in the `package.json` or `.npmrc` files are maliciously modified, it could lead to command injection during the `npm install` phase of the build process.
  3. Similarly, the `gulp updateRoslynVersion` command, also part of the build process, could be vulnerable if its dependencies or execution environment are compromised.
  4. The `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:unit:razor` and similar test execution commands specified in `CONTRIBUTING.md` rely on `jest` and other npm dependencies. Malicious modifications in these dependencies or test files could lead to command injection during test execution.
  5. The `dotnet restore` commands, used in the build process and through commands like `dotnet.restore.project` and `dotnet.restore.all`, could be vulnerable to command injection if the project files or environment are maliciously modified.

- Impact:
  - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine during the build or test phases. This could lead to credential theft, data exfiltration, or supply chain compromise if malicious build artifacts are created.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The project relies on `npm` and `dotnet` commands without specific input sanitization against malicious project files or environment variables.

- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization and validation for all command execution paths in build and test scripts.
  - Dependency scanning and vulnerability checks for npm packages used in the build and test processes.
  - Sandboxing or containerization of build and test environments to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer clones a repository containing malicious modifications in `package.json`, `.npmrc`, project files, or test files.
  - The developer follows the "Building, Running, and Testing the Repository" instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and executes `npm install`, `gulp` commands, or test execution commands like `npm run test:unit`.
  - Environment variables used by the build or test scripts are maliciously manipulated.

- Source code analysis:
  - Examine `gulpfile.ts`, `tasks/testTasks.ts`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, and other build and test related scripts for command execution patterns, particularly those involving user-controlled input or external dependencies.
  - Analyze the code paths for `gulp installDependencies`, `gulp updateRoslynVersion`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `dotnet restore`, and other similar commands for potential injection points.
  - Review the code for use of `child_process.exec` or similar functions without adequate input sanitization or escaping.

- Security test case:
  1. Create a malicious npm package that contains code to execute arbitrary commands during installation.
  2. Modify the `package.json` of a cloned repository to depend on this malicious npm package.
  3. As a test user, navigate to the cloned repository and execute `npm install`.
  4. Observe if the malicious code from the npm package is executed during installation.
  5. Alternatively, modify a test file to include code that attempts to execute arbitrary commands when the tests are run.
  6. Execute `npm run test:unit` or similar test command and observe if the malicious code within the test file is executed during test execution.
  7. In another test case, create a malicious project file (e.g., `.csproj`) that contains code to execute arbitrary commands during the `dotnet restore` or `dotnet build` phase.
  8. Attempt to build or restore the project using the provided gulp tasks or dotnet commands, and observe if the malicious code within the project file is executed during these phases.
