### Vulnerability List for C# for Visual Studio Code Extension

* Vulnerability Name: **Path Traversal in OmniSharp Server Path Configuration**
* Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `dotnet.server.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable located outside of the intended directories.
    2. When the C# extension activates, it will launch the executable specified in the `dotnet.server.path` setting.
    3. If a user is tricked into opening a workspace with a malicious `settings.json` containing an altered `dotnet.server.path` configuration, the attacker's executable will be launched instead of the legitimate OmniSharp server.
* Impact:
    * **High**. Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's machine by executing malicious code through the VS Code C# extension.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The `dotnet.server.path` setting allows arbitrary paths.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Input validation for `dotnet.server.path` setting to restrict paths to a predefined set of safe directories or enforce that the path must be within the extension's installation directory.
    * Warning message to the user when `dotnet.server.path` is modified, especially if it points outside of the expected directories.
* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs to convince a user to open a workspace with a malicious `settings.json` containing an altered `dotnet.server.path`.
* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts**
    2. Function `getServerPath` retrieves the server path from settings:
    ```typescript
    function getServerPath(platformInfo: PlatformInformation) {
        let serverPath = process.env.DOTNET_ROSLYN_SERVER_PATH;

        if (serverPath) {
            _channel.appendLine(`Using server path override from DOTNET_ROSLYN_SERVER_PATH: ${serverPath}`);
        } else {
            serverPath = commonOptions.serverPath; // Reads from settings `dotnet.server.path`
            if (!serverPath) {
                // Option not set, use the path from the extension.
                serverPath = getInstalledServerPath(platformInfo);
            }
        }

        if (!fs.existsSync(serverPath)) {
            throw new Error(`Cannot find language server in path '${serverPath}'`);
        }

        return serverPath;
    }
    ```
    3. The code reads `dotnet.server.path` from settings without any validation that the path is safe.
    4. An attacker can modify the `dotnet.server.path` setting to point to a malicious executable.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_server.sh` on Linux, `malicious_server.bat` on Windows) that, for example, writes to a file in the user's home directory and then exits.
    2. Create a VS Code workspace.
    3. In the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), add the following:
    ```json
    {
        "dotnet.server.path": "/path/to/malicious_server.sh" // or "C:\\path\\to\\malicious_server.bat"
    }
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/malicious_server.sh` or `C:\\path\\to\\malicious_server.bat` with the actual path to your malicious executable.
    4. Open a C# project in this workspace.
    5. Observe that the malicious executable is executed when the C# extension starts, as evidenced by the file written to the home directory.

* Vulnerability Name: **Unsafe Deserialization in Razor Project Configuration**
* Description:
    1. The Razor language server uses `MessagePack` for serialization/deserialization of `project.razor.*` configuration files, as indicated in Changelog.md: "* Use message pack for project.razor.* configuration file (PR: [#9270](https://github.com/dotnet/razor/pull/9270))".
    2. If `MessagePack` is used without proper configuration, it can be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization attacks, where malicious data in the `project.razor.*` files could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    3. An attacker could craft a malicious `project.razor.*` file with embedded code.
    4. When the C# extension loads the project and deserializes this file, it might execute the malicious code.
* Impact:
    * **High to Critical**. Arbitrary code execution. If unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists, attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by crafting malicious `project.razor.*` files.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * Unknown. The code files do not explicitly show mitigation for unsafe deserialization in `MessagePack`.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Ensure `MessagePack` deserialization is configured securely to prevent code execution during deserialization.
    * Input validation and sanitization of `project.razor.*` files to prevent malicious data from being processed.
* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs to be able to place a malicious `project.razor.*` file in the project directory, for example, by contributing to a public repository or through other means of file system access.
* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/CHANGELOG.md**
    2. Changelog entry indicates usage of `MessagePack`: "* Use message pack for project.razor.* configuration file (PR: [#9270](https://github.com/dotnet/razor/pull/9270))"
    3. The code base does not reveal details about how `MessagePack` is configured and if it's securely used. Deeper analysis of Razor code is needed to confirm if unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious `project.razor.json` or `project.razor.bin` file with payload designed to be executed during deserialization by a vulnerable MessagePack configuration (requires deeper knowledge of MessagePack vulnerabilities and how Razor project configuration files are processed).
    2. Place this malicious file in a test workspace.
    3. Open the workspace in VS Code with the C# extension.
    4. Monitor for execution of the malicious payload, which could be detected by observing network requests, file system modifications outside of the expected project directory, or other anomalous behaviors.

Missing Mitigations will be updated after deeper analysis and testing.

Mitigations are not implemented in project from PROJECT FILES, but should be addressed in future versions.
