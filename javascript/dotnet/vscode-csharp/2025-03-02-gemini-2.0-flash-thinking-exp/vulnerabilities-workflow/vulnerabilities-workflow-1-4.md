## Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Malicious Language Middleware Registration

- Description:
    - An external attacker can register malicious language middleware by invoking the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command.
    - This malicious middleware can intercept and modify workspace edits and locations through the `remapWorkspaceEdit` and `remapLocations` methods in the registered middleware.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker develops a VS Code extension.
        2. The extension registers a malicious language middleware using the `vscode.commands.executeCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', maliciousMiddleware)`.
        3. The malicious middleware implements the `remapWorkspaceEdit` and/or `remapLocations` methods to perform malicious actions.
        4. When a user performs actions that trigger remapping (e.g., rename, go to definition, find references), the malicious middleware is invoked.
        5. The malicious middleware can then manipulate the `workspaceEdit` or `locations` objects, potentially leading to code corruption or information leakage when the modified edits or locations are applied by the user.

- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can potentially manipulate code within the workspace by altering workspace edits, leading to backdoors or unexpected behavior.
    - Information disclosure: By manipulating locations, the attacker might redirect users to incorrect or sensitive code locations, potentially leading to information leakage if sensitive data is exposed in those locations.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project currently does not have any mitigations to prevent malicious middleware registration.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The project should validate the middleware being registered to ensure it conforms to expected structure and does not contain malicious code.
    - Access control: Restrict access to the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command to prevent unauthorized middleware registration. Consider if this command should be exposed publicly at all.
    - Code review: Thoroughly review and audit any registered middlewares to ensure they are safe and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - A publicly available instance of the VS Code extension is running and connected to an OmniSharp server.
    - The attacker has the ability to develop and install a VS Code extension that can execute commands.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/omnisharp/languageMiddlewareFeature.ts`
    - Step 1: The `LanguageMiddlewareFeature` class is defined to manage language middlewares.
    - Step 2: The `register()` method registers the command `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware`:
        ```typescript
        public register(): void {
            this._registration = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
                'omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware',
                (middleware: LanguageMiddleware) => {
                    this._middlewares.push(middleware);
                }
            );
        }
        ```
        - This command is publicly accessible through VS Code's command palette and extension API.
    - Step 3: The `remap()` method iterates through the registered middlewares and calls the `remapWorkspaceEdit` or `remapLocations` method of each middleware:
        ```typescript
        public async remap<M extends keyof RemapApi, P extends RemapParameterType<M>>(
            remapType: M,
            original: P,
            token: vscode.CancellationToken
        ): Promise<P> {
            // ...
            for (const middleware of languageMiddlewares) {
                const method = <(p: P, c: vscode.CancellationToken) => vscode.ProviderResult<P>>middleware[remapType];
                if (!method) {
                    continue;
                }
                const result = await method.call(middleware, remapped, token);
                if (result) {
                    remapped = result;
                }
            }
            return remapped;
            // ...
        }
        ```
    - Step 4: There is no validation or access control implemented for the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command or the registered middlewares, allowing any extension to register arbitrary middleware.

- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a new VS Code extension.
    - Step 2: In the extension's `extension.ts` file, add the following code to register a malicious middleware when the extension is activated:
        ```typescript
        import * as vscode from 'vscode';

        export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
            const maliciousMiddleware = {
                language: 'csharp',
                remapWorkspaceEdit: (workspaceEdit: vscode.WorkspaceEdit, token: vscode.CancellationToken) => {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Malicious middleware active: WorkspaceEdit intercepted!');
                    // Example malicious action: Replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in every file.
                    for (const uri of workspaceEdit.keys()) {
                        const edits = workspaceEdit.get(uri);
                        const newEdits = edits.map(edit => {
                            return new vscode.TextEdit(edit.range, edit.newText.replace(/foo/g, 'bar'));
                        });
                        workspaceEdit.set(uri, newEdits);
                    }
                    return workspaceEdit;
                },
                remapLocations: (locations: vscode.Location[] | vscode.LocationLink[], token: vscode.CancellationToken) => {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Malicious middleware active: Locations intercepted!');
                    // Example malicious action: Redirect all locations to a dummy file.
                    const dummyUri = vscode.Uri.file('/tmp/dummy.cs');
                    const remappedLocations = locations.map(location => new vscode.Location(dummyUri, vscode.Position(0, 0)));
                    return remappedLocations;
                }
            };
            vscode.commands.executeCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', maliciousMiddleware);
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Malicious middleware registered!');
        }
        ```
    - Step 3: Package and install the extension in VS Code.
    - Step 4: Open a C# project in VS Code.
    - Step 5: Trigger a rename operation in a C# file.
    - Step 6: Observe that an error message "Malicious middleware active: WorkspaceEdit intercepted!" appears, indicating that the malicious middleware has intercepted the workspace edit. Also, verify that "foo" is replaced with "bar" in the renamed file.
    - Step 7: Trigger "Go to Definition" or "Find All References".
    - Step 8: Observe that an error message "Malicious middleware active: Locations intercepted!" appears, indicating that the malicious middleware has intercepted the locations. Verify that navigation is redirected to the dummy file.
