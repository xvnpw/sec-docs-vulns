Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you would like me to update. I need the list to be able to filter it according to your instructions and return the updated list in markdown format.

Once you provide the list, I will process each vulnerability and:

*   **Evaluate for exclusion criteria:**
    *   Developer-induced insecure code patterns from project files.
    *   Missing documentation as the *only* issue.
    *   Denial of service vulnerability.
*   **Evaluate for inclusion criteria:**
    *   Valid and not already fully mitigated.
    *   Vulnerability rank is 'high' or 'critical'.

Only the vulnerabilities that meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be included in the final markdown formatted list.

Looking forward to receiving your vulnerability list!
