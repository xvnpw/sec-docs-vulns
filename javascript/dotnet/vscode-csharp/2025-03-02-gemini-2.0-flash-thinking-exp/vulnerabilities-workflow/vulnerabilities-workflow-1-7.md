Here is the vulnerability in markdown format, keeping the original description:

### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Local Language Server Debugging Misconfiguration
- Description:
    1. A developer clones a malicious Roslyn or Razor repository, controlled by a threat actor.
    2. Following the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the developer configures their workspace `settings.json` to debug a local language server by setting `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` to point to the cloned malicious repository's build artifacts.
    3. The developer then attempts to debug the C# extension in VS Code, as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    4. When the extension launches a new VS Code instance and opens a C# project, it loads the configured malicious language server DLL.
    5. The malicious DLL, now running within the VS Code extension host process, can execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine, potentially compromising their development environment and data.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on developer's machine. An attacker can gain full control over the developer's VS Code instance and potentially access sensitive information or further compromise the developer's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any mitigations against this type of vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation:** The extension should warn users when they are configuring `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` to point to locations outside of trusted, known paths.
    - **Documentation clarification:** The documentation should explicitly warn developers about the security risks of using locally built language servers, especially from untrusted sources.
    - **Code integrity checks:**  While difficult for local builds, for official builds, ensure integrity checks of language server DLLs are in place to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a developer to clone a malicious Roslyn or Razor repository.
    - The developer must follow the debugging instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and configure their workspace settings to use the malicious local language server.
    - The developer must attempt to debug the C# extension in VS Code with the misconfiguration.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The file `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md` provides detailed instructions on how to set up local language servers for debugging.
    2. Sections "Configuring Roslyn Language Server" and "Configuring Razor Language Server" describe modifying workspace `settings.json` to point `dotnet.server.path` and `razor.languageServer.directory` to local DLL paths.
    3. The instructions encourage developers to use locally built debug versions of Roslyn and Razor language servers, which, if sourced from a malicious repository, could contain malicious code.
    4. The code itself does not enforce any checks on the validity or trustworthiness of the DLL paths provided in the settings.

         V
    Arbitrary Code Execution (within VS Code extension host context)
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious Roslyn Language Server DLL (e.g., `MaliciousLanguageServer.dll`). This DLL, when loaded, should execute a benign payload like writing to a file system or displaying a warning message as a proof of concept.
    2. Create a fake Roslyn repository structure with the malicious DLL in the expected artifact path (e.g., `$roslynRepoRoot/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer/Debug/net9.0/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll`).
    3. Create a new VS Code workspace.
    4. Open the workspace in VS Code.
    5. Edit the workspace `settings.json` file.
    6. Add the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
        "dotnet.server.waitForDebugger": true,
        "dotnet.server.path": "<path to the malicious Roslyn DLL>"
    }
    ```
    Replace `<path to the malicious Roslyn DLL>` with the actual path to the `MaliciousLanguageServer.dll` created in step 1.
    7. Open a C# file in the workspace. This should trigger the C# extension to activate.
    8. Observe if the benign payload from the malicious DLL is executed (e.g., check for the file written to the file system or the warning message displayed).
    9. If the payload executes, it confirms the vulnerability: arbitrary code execution by misconfiguring local language server debugging.
