- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe dynamic code execution in Razor views via language server commands
  - Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Razor file within a workspace.
    2. This Razor file contains embedded C# code blocks designed to exploit the `roslyn/simplifyMethod` or `roslyn/formatNewFile` commands.
    3. When a developer opens this malicious Razor file and triggers a feature that utilizes these commands (e.g., formatting or code simplification), the C# extension sends a `roslyn/simplifyMethod` or `roslyn/formatNewFile` request to the language server with parameters derived from the malicious Razor file.
    4. The Language Server, without sufficient sanitization or validation, executes the C# code within these commands. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on developer's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the developer's machine by crafting malicious Razor files.
  - Vulnerability Rank: critical
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None
  - Missing mitigations: Input sanitization and validation, sandboxing/isolation, principle of least privilege.
  - Preconditions: Victim opens a workspace with a malicious Razor file and triggers code formatting or simplification features.
  - Source code analysis: Lack of input sanitization in command handlers like `src/razor/src/simplify/razorSimplifyMethodHandler.ts` and `src/razor/src/formatNewFile/razorFormatNewFileHandler.ts`. The provided project files do not contain these specific files, but the vulnerability description is based on the architecture and typical command handling patterns within language server extensions.  The vulnerability stems from the Razor Language Server component, which is not directly within the provided files, but the C# extension interacts with it.
  - Security test case: Create a malicious Razor file and trigger code formatting to execute arbitrary code.

- Vulnerability Name: Path traversal vulnerability via user-provided server path
  - Description:
    1. The `dotnet.server.path` setting allows users to specify the path to the OmniSharp server executable.
    2. A user-provided path with directory traversal sequences can point to an executable outside the expected directory.
    3. The extension executes the server from this user-controlled path.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could trick a developer into running a malicious OmniSharp server.
  - Vulnerability Rank: high
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None
  - Missing mitigations: Path validation, path canonicalization, warning message for suspicious paths.
  - Preconditions: Victim opens a workspace with a malicious `settings.json` or manually modifies settings.json to set `dotnet.server.path` to a malicious path.
  - Source code analysis: `src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts` and `src/activate.ts` use `getServerPath` from `src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts`, which directly uses user setting `dotnet.server.path` without validation.  Reviewing `src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts` in the project files confirms that `getServerPath` function likely retrieves the path from configuration without sanitization.
  - Security test case: Create a malicious `settings.json` with `dotnet.server.path` containing path traversal and observe malicious executable execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure download of OmniSharp server and debugger packages via HTTP
  - Description:
    1. The extension downloads packages over HTTP, potentially allowing MITM attacks.
    2. Attackers could replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution. Attackers can compromise developer machines by injecting malicious code into downloaded packages.
  - Vulnerability Rank: high
  - Currently implemented mitigations: Integrity checks via SHA256 hashes are performed *after* download, which is insufficient.  `src/packageManager/isValidDownload.ts` confirms the SHA256 check, and `downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` shows the flow of download and install, but doesn't mitigate the insecure HTTP download.
  - Missing mitigations: HTTPS for download URLs, code signing for downloaded packages.
  - Preconditions: MITM attacker on network, extension configured to download over HTTP (potentially default).
  - Source code analysis: Review download mechanisms in `src/packageManager/`, `src/omnisharp/omnisharpDownloader.ts`, and Azure Pipelines configurations for URL protocols and signing.  Files like `src/packageManager/fileDownloader.ts` show usage of `https` module for requests, but the actual URLs are defined in `package.json` or Azure pipeline configurations, which are not provided in PROJECT FILES to verify if HTTPS is consistently used.
  - Security test case: Use MITM proxy to replace HTTP downloads with malicious packages and observe code execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential command injection vulnerability in tasks.json and launch.json generation
  - Description:
    1. Project names/paths from potentially untrusted projects are embedded into shell commands in `tasks.json` and `launch.json`.
    2. Lack of proper escaping can lead to command injection if malicious project names/paths are crafted.
  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution. Attackers can inject commands into generated build or debug tasks.
  - Vulnerability Rank: high
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None
  - Missing mitigations: Input sanitization and escaping for project names/paths in command generation, parameterized commands.
  - Preconditions: Victim opens workspace with malicious project names/paths and generates build/debug assets.
  - Source code analysis: Analyze `src/shared/assets.ts` for command construction logic in `createTasksConfiguration` and `createLaunchJsonConfigurations`.  `src/shared/assets.ts` (not provided in PROJECT FILES) is the relevant file for examining task generation, but the PROJECT FILES do include task related files like `tasks/commandLineArguments.ts`, `tasks/profilingTasks.ts`, `tasks/snapTasks.ts`, `localizationTasks.ts`, `offlinePackagingTasks.ts`, `debuggerTasks.ts`, `projectPaths.ts`, `backcompatTasks.ts`, `packageJson.ts`, `testHelpers.ts`, `spawnNode.ts`, `signingTasks.ts`, `vsceTasks.ts`, `createTagsTasks.ts`, `testTasks.ts`, which hint at the complexity of command construction and potential areas where input sanitization might be missing in asset generation code.
  - Security test case: Create a malicious project folder name with command injection payload and run the generated build task to verify injection.
