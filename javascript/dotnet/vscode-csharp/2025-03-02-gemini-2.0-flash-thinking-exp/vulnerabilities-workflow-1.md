### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Language Middleware Injection in Remap Function

- Vulnerability Name: Language Middleware Injection in Remap Function
- Description:
    1. An external attacker can register a malicious Language Middleware by calling the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command with crafted middleware.
    2. This middleware can implement the `remapWorkspaceEdit` and `remapLocations` functions.
    3. When the `remap` function in `LanguageMiddlewareFeature` is called with a `remapType` (e.g., 'remapWorkspaceEdit' or 'remapLocations'), it iterates through the registered middlewares.
    4. For each middleware, it retrieves the corresponding method (e.g., `middleware.remapWorkspaceEdit`) and calls it using `method.call(middleware, remapped, token)`.
    5. Because the middleware is provided by an external source (via `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command), a malicious middleware can inject arbitrary code or manipulate the `workspaceEdit` or `locations` objects during the remapping process, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure depending on how the remapped objects are used later.
- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary code execution within the extension's context or manipulation of workspace edits/locations, potentially leading to malicious modifications of user code or information disclosure.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The project currently lacks input validation or sanitization of the registered middleware and its methods.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the middleware object and its functions registered via `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command.
    - Consider restricting middleware registration to only trusted sources or implementing a secure mechanism for middleware management.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to trigger the `omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware` command. This command is registered using `vscode.commands.registerCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', ...)` which is generally intended for extension developers to register middleware. However, if an attacker can somehow trigger this command (e.g., via a crafted extension or a vulnerability in the extension host), they could register malicious middleware.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/omnisharp/languageMiddlewareFeature.ts

    public register(): void {
        this._registration = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
            'omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware',
            (middleware: LanguageMiddleware) => { // [Potential Vulnerability Point] Middleware object is directly pushed to _middlewares array
                this._middlewares.push(middleware);
            }
        );
    }

    public async remap<M extends keyof RemapApi, P extends RemapParameterType<M>>(
        remapType: M,
        original: P,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): Promise<P> {
        try {
            const languageMiddlewares = this.getLanguageMiddlewares();
            let remapped = original;

            for (const middleware of languageMiddlewares) {
                // Commit a type crime because we know better than the compiler
                const method = <(p: P, c: vscode.CancellationToken) => vscode.ProviderResult<P>>middleware[remapType]; // [Potential Vulnerability Point] Method from middleware is retrieved without validation
                if (!method) {
                    continue;
                }

                const result = await method.call(middleware, remapped, token); // [Vulnerability Trigger] Method from external middleware is called with user-controlled data (original)
                if (result) {
                    remapped = result;
                }
            }

            return remapped;
        } catch (_) {
            // Something happened while remapping. Return the original.
            return original;
        }
    }
    ```
    - Visualization:
      ```
      [External Attacker] --> omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware(maliciousMiddleware) --> LanguageMiddlewareFeature._middlewares
      [Language Middleware Feature] --> remap(remapType, original, token)
                                          |
                                          V
                                        For each middleware in _middlewares:
                                          |
                                          V
                                        method = middleware[remapType]
                                          |
                                          V
                                        result = method.call(middleware, remapped, token) --> [Malicious Middleware Code Execution]
                                          |
                                          V
                                        Return remapped
      ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious VS Code extension.
    2. In the extension's `extension.ts`, register a language middleware that intercepts `remapWorkspaceEdit`. This middleware should contain malicious code, for example, writing to a file in the user's workspace or exfiltrating data.
    3. Use `vscode.commands.executeCommand('omnisharp.registerLanguageMiddleware', maliciousMiddleware)` to register the middleware.
    4. Trigger a code action or refactoring in a C# file that utilizes the `LanguageMiddlewareFeature.remap` function with 'remapWorkspaceEdit' type (e.g., rename).
    5. Observe if the malicious code in the registered middleware is executed (e.g., check for the file written by the malicious middleware or monitor network traffic for data exfiltration).
    6. Rank: High, because it allows for arbitrary code execution within the extension context, which could lead to significant compromise.

#### Vulnerability 2: Insecure VSTS NPM Registry Configuration

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure VSTS NPM Registry Configuration
- Description: The project uses an Azure DevOps Artifacts feed for npm package management, configured via `vsts-npm-auth`. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to authenticate using `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`. If the resulting `.npmrc` file, which may contain authentication tokens, is unintentionally committed to a public repository, it could expose sensitive credentials. An attacker could then use these credentials to access the private feed, potentially leading to data breaches or supply chain attacks by injecting malicious packages.
- Impact: High. Exposure of credentials allowing unauthorized access to a private Azure DevOps Artifacts feed, potentially enabling data breaches or supply chain attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the project files.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Documentation Update: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` should be updated with a clear and strong warning against committing the `.npmrc` file to version control, especially public repositories. It should emphasize that this file contains sensitive authentication information.
    - Secure Credential Management: The build process should be re-evaluated to avoid relying on local `.npmrc` files for authentication in CI/CD environments. Consider using secure credential injection mechanisms provided by CI/CD platforms instead.
- Preconditions:
    - Developers follow the `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions.
    - The generated `.npmrc` file contains sensitive credentials.
    - The `.npmrc` file is accidentally or intentionally committed to a publicly accessible repository.
    - An attacker discovers and extracts the credentials from the committed `.npmrc` file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`
    - ```markdown
      1. Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`, then run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` - This command will configure your credentials for the next command.
    ```
    - The documentation encourages generating and potentially committing `.npmrc`, which is a security risk if credentials are included.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a private GitHub repository.
        - Clone the `vscode-csharp` repository locally.
        - Navigate to the cloned `vscode-csharp` directory in the terminal.
        - Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`.
        - Run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    2. **Verification:**
        - Inspect the generated `.npmrc` file in the root directory. Verify that it contains authentication details, such as tokens or credentials, for the Azure DevOps Artifacts feed (`dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com`).
        - Add and commit the `.npmrc` file to the private GitHub repository:
          ```bash
          git add .npmrc
          git commit -m "Commit .npmrc with VSTS auth config (simulating accidental commit)"
          ```
        - Make the repository public (to simulate public exposure).
    3. **Exploitation Simulation (Attacker Perspective):**
        - Clone the now public repository to a separate attacker machine or user account.
        - Inspect the `.npmrc` file in the cloned repository.
        - Attempt to use the credentials in the `.npmrc` to access the VSTS npm registry. For instance, try to install a package using `npm install --registry=https://dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com/public/_packaging/dotnet-public-npm/npm/registry/ some-dummy-package --userconfig .npmrc`.
        - If the command succeeds without prompting for further authentication, it confirms that the credentials in `.npmrc` grant access to the feed.

#### Vulnerability 3: Command Injection in OmniSharp Server Launch

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in OmniSharp Server Launch
- Description: The `launchWindows` and `launchNixMono` functions in `/code/src/omnisharp/launcher.ts` construct shell commands using `spawn` and `cmd /c` on Windows. Specifically, the `launchWindows` function uses `cmd /c` to execute the OmniSharp server, and it constructs the command string by concatenating arguments, including the `launchPath` and `args` array. If any of the elements in the `args` array, which are derived from configuration settings or project files, contain shell- Metacharacters and are not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection. An attacker who can control these configuration settings or project files could inject arbitrary commands into the OmniSharp server launch process.
- Impact: High. Arbitrary command execution on the server machine. An attacker could gain full control over the machine where the OmniSharp server is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks on the internal network.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the provided code. The code uses `escapeIfNeeded` function in `launchWindows` which escapes `&` but might not be sufficient to prevent all command injection scenarios.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all arguments passed to `spawn` and `cmd /c`, especially the `launchPath` and elements in the `args` array.  Use parameterized execution or shell-escaping mechanisms that are proven to be secure against command injection for the target shell (`cmd` on Windows, `bash` or `mono` on Linux/macOS).
    - Avoid `cmd /c`:  On Windows, avoid using `cmd /c` to execute commands. Use direct execution via `spawn` with an array of arguments, which generally avoids shell interpretation and command injection risks, or use `windowsVerbatimArguments: true` with `cmd`.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker can influence the configuration settings that contribute to the `args` array used to launch the OmniSharp server. This could be through poisoning project files or manipulating VS Code settings if those settings are not securely handled.
    - The OmniSharp server is launched using a vulnerable configuration.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/omnisharp/launcher.ts`
    - Function: `launchWindows`
    ```typescript
    function launchWindows(launchPath: string, cwd: string, args: string[]): IntermediateLaunchResult {
        function escapeIfNeeded(arg: string) {
            const hasSpaceWithoutQuotes = /^[^"].* .*[^"]/;
            return hasSpaceWithoutQuotes.test(arg) ? `"${arg}"` : arg.replace('&', '^&');
        }

        let argsCopy = args.slice(0); // create copy of args
        argsCopy.unshift(`"${launchPath}"`);
        argsCopy = [['/s', '/c', '"' + argsCopy.map(escapeIfNeeded).join(' ') + '"'].join(' ')];

        const process = spawn('cmd', argsCopy, {
            windowsVerbatimArguments: true,
            detached: false,
            cwd: cwd,
        });
    ```
    - The code uses `cmd /c` to execute the command on Windows. The `escapeIfNeeded` function attempts to escape arguments, but it's unclear if it's sufficient for all injection scenarios. The use of `windowsVerbatimArguments: true` might help, but the overall approach of constructing shell commands from potentially untrusted inputs is inherently risky.
    - Function: `launchNixMono`
    ```typescript
    function launchNixMono(
        launchPath: string,
        cwd: string,
        args: string[],
        environment: NodeJS.ProcessEnv
    ): ChildProcessWithoutNullStreams {
        const process = spawn('mono', args, {
            detached: false,
            cwd: cwd,
            env: environment,
        });

        return process;
    }
    ```
    - The `launchNixMono` function uses `spawn('mono', args, ...)` on Linux/macOS. While using an array for arguments is generally safer than constructing a string command, it's still crucial to ensure that the `args` array is properly sanitized, especially if any elements are derived from user-controlled or external sources.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Modify the project's configuration (e.g., `omnisharp.json` or VS Code settings) to introduce a malicious argument. For example, if the server accepts arguments via a configuration file, inject an argument like `--something="; malicious_command; "`. Alternatively, if the launch arguments are constructed based on project file names, create a project file with a name containing shell metacharacters.
    2. **Trigger Server Launch:**
        - Open a C# project in VS Code to trigger the OmniSharp server launch.
    3. **Exploitation Attempt (Windows):**
        - Observe if the injected command is executed by inspecting the running processes or by redirecting command output to a file. For example, inject an argument that creates a file in a known location (`--logfile="C:\temp\pwned.txt"`).
    4. **Exploitation Attempt (Linux/macOS):**
        - Similarly, on Linux/macOS, inject arguments that attempt to execute commands (e.g., using backticks or `$(...)`) and check for signs of command execution. For example, inject an argument that attempts to write to a file (`--logfile=/tmp/pwned.txt`).
    5. **Verification:**
        - Check if the injected command was successfully executed. For example, verify if the file `C:\temp\pwned.txt` or `/tmp/pwned.txt` was created, or if a process with the injected command was spawned. If successful, this confirms the command injection vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 4: Arbitrary Code Execution via Debugger Attach

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Debugger Attach
- Description:
    1. An attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace containing a malicious `.csproj` or `.sln` file.
    2. The attacker convinces the user to initiate a debug session using the "Attach to Process..." functionality within VS Code.
    3. The malicious project file is crafted to insert a malicious command within the `tasks.json` or `launch.json` generation process. This can be achieved by manipulating project properties that are used in the asset generation logic.
    4. When the user selects a process to attach to, VS Code executes the generated `tasks.json` or `launch.json`, leading to the execution of the malicious command as part of the debugger setup.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine under the privileges of the user running VS Code.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to fully compromise the user's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the project code itself. Mitigation relies solely on user vigilance and avoiding opening workspaces from untrusted sources.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of project files, specifically `.csproj` and `.sln` files, to prevent command injection during `tasks.json` and `launch.json` generation.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the debugger attach process to limit the impact of potential code execution during debugger setup.
    - User warnings when attaching debugger to a process in a workspace that is not fully trusted.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a workspace containing a malicious project file.
    - User has the C# extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - User attempts to use the "Attach to Process..." debugging feature within the malicious workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Review of `src/shared/assets.ts` reveals functions `createTasksConfiguration` and `createLaunchJsonConfigurations` responsible for generating debugger configuration files. These functions use project information to construct the configuration.
    2. The project information is derived from project files (`.csproj`, `.sln`). If these project files are maliciously crafted, they could inject commands into the generated configuration files.
    3. While the provided code does not show explicit injection vulnerabilities within the `.ts` files, the *design* relies on project files as input for generating executable configurations.
    4. Specifically, the vulnerability is not in the extension's code, but in VS Code's execution of generated `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files, which are indirectly influenced by potentially malicious project files.
    5. The `launcher.ts` and related files (`omnisharpManager.ts`, `omnisharpDownloader.ts`) are involved in starting the OmniSharp server, but not directly in the debugger attach process that is vulnerable here. The vulnerability is in the interaction between VS Code's debugging system and the extension's generated configuration, driven by project file data.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious Project:**
        - Create a new folder named `malicious-project`.
        - Inside `malicious-project`, create a file named `malicious.csproj` with the following content:
        ```xml
        <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
          <PropertyGroup>
            <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
            <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
          </PropertyGroup>
          <Target Name="PreLaunchTask">
            <Exec Command="echo '[+] Malicious command executed!' &amp;&amp; calc.exe" />
          </Target>
        </Project>
        ```
        - Create a `Program.cs` file in the same directory with any basic C# code (e.g., `Console.WriteLine("Hello");`).
    2. **Create a Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new VS Code workspace or use an existing one.
        - Add the `malicious-project` folder to the workspace.
        - Save the workspace file (e.g., `malicious-workspace.code-workspace`).
    3. **Open Malicious Workspace in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code and load the `malicious-workspace.code-workspace`.
        - Allow VS Code to load the C# extension when prompted.
    4. **Initiate Debugger Attach:**
        - Go to the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
        - Click "Create Configuration" and select ".NET: Attach to Process".
        - This should generate a default `launch.json` if one doesn't exist.
    5. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - In the Debug view, ensure "Attach to Process" configuration is selected.
        - Click the "Start Debugging" button (green play button).
        - VS Code will show the process picker. Selecting any process will trigger the vulnerability because the malicious command is set as a preLaunchTask, which is executed before attaching.
    6. **Observe Malicious Command Execution:**
        - Observe if `calc.exe` (or another indicator like a popup message, file creation, network request as defined in malicious command) is executed. This confirms arbitrary code execution.
    7. **Expected Result:**
        - `calc.exe` should launch, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
        - The Output window might show "[+] Malicious command executed!".

#### Vulnerability 5: Debugger Path Traversal in vsdbg-ui

- Vulnerability Name: Debugger Path Traversal in vsdbg-ui
- Description:
    1. The C# extension downloads the debugger component `vsdbg-ui` as part of its installation or update process.
    2. This component is typically distributed as a ZIP archive and extracted to a directory within the extension's installation path, usually under `.debugger`.
    3. If the extraction process used to unpack the `vsdbg-ui` archive is vulnerable to path traversal, a maliciously crafted ZIP archive could overwrite files outside the intended `.debugger` directory.
    4. An attacker could potentially create a malicious `vsdbg-ui` package containing files with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) in their filenames.
    5. When the extension attempts to download and extract this malicious package, the path traversal vulnerability could allow the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system, leading to potential arbitrary code execution or data corruption.
- Impact: Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by overwriting executable files or data corruption by modifying critical system or user files.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Current mitigations rely on the security and integrity of the download source and the extraction utilities used. There is no explicit path traversal protection within the PROJECT FILES.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement a secure extraction process that actively prevents path traversal vulnerabilities, such as validating and sanitizing file paths during extraction.
    - Implement validation of downloaded debugger packages using checksums or digital signatures to ensure integrity and prevent tampering before extraction.
    - Consider using sandboxing or isolation for the extraction process to limit the potential damage from a path traversal exploit.
- Preconditions:
    - User installs or updates the C# extension in VS Code.
    - The extension's installation or update process triggers the download and extraction of the `vsdbg-ui` debugger component.
    - An attacker is able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack or compromise the download source to serve a malicious `vsdbg-ui` package.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The provided PROJECT FILES include `src/packageManager/downloadAndInstallPackages.ts`, which is likely involved in downloading and extracting packages, including `vsdbg-ui`.
    2. The function `downloadAndInstallPackages` and related functions in `src/packageManager` should be reviewed for the archive extraction logic. Specifically, check how filenames from the ZIP archive are handled during extraction and if they are properly validated to prevent path traversal.
    3. While the code in `downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` itself might not reveal the exact extraction library used (like `adm-zip` mentioned in the previous context), the potential vulnerability exists in the extraction process triggered by this code.
    4. Deeper analysis of `gulp installDependencies` task in `gulpfile.ts` and `tasks/debuggerTasks.ts` and `src/packageManager/downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` is needed to pinpoint the exact extraction logic and libraries being used.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious Debugger Package:**
        - Create a ZIP archive named `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip`.
        - Within the archive, create a file with a path traversal filename, for example: `../../../evil.txt`. The content of this file can be arbitrary, like "pwned".
        - Place another benign file inside the archive, e.g., `正常.txt` to make it a valid zip archive.
    2. **Simulate Malicious Download Source:**
        - Option 1 (MITM): Set up a proxy (e.g., using Burp Suite or mitmproxy) to intercept requests for the `vsdbg-ui` download URL. Configure the proxy to serve the `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip` archive instead of the legitimate package.
        - Option 2 (Local Server): Host the `malicious-vsdbg-ui.zip` on a local HTTP server. Modify the extension's code (for testing purposes only) to download from your local server instead of the official source. This could involve temporarily changing the download URL in `gulp installDependencies` or related scripts.
    3. **Trigger Debugger Installation:**
        - Install or update the C# extension in VS Code. This should trigger the `gulp installDependencies` task and attempt to download and install the debugger component. If you modified the download URL to point to your local server (Option 2), simply installing the extension is sufficient. For MITM (Option 1), ensure the malicious debugger package is served when the extension attempts to download `vsdbg-ui`.
    4. **Check for Arbitrary File Write:**
        - After the debugger installation process completes (or fails), check if the file `evil.txt` has been created in the root directory of your user profile or another unexpected location outside the extension's directory. The exact location will depend on the path traversal sequence used in the malicious archive.
    5. **Verify Arbitrary File Content:**
        - If `evil.txt` is found, check its content to ensure it matches the content you placed in the malicious archive ("pwned").
    6. **Expected Result:**
        - The file `evil.txt` should be created outside the extension's `.debugger` directory (e.g., in the user's profile root), containing the content "pwned", demonstrating a successful path traversal vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 6: Local Language Server Debugging Misconfiguration

- Vulnerability Name: Local Language Server Debugging Misconfiguration
- Description:
    1. A developer clones a malicious Roslyn or Razor repository, controlled by a threat actor.
    2. Following the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the developer configures their workspace `settings.json` to debug a local language server by setting `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` to point to the cloned malicious repository's build artifacts.
    3. The developer then attempts to debug the C# extension in VS Code, as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    4. When the extension launches a new VS Code instance and opens a C# project, it loads the configured malicious language server DLL.
    5. The malicious DLL, now running within the VS Code extension host process, can execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine, potentially compromising their development environment and data.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on developer's machine. An attacker can gain full control over the developer's VS Code instance and potentially access sensitive information or further compromise the developer's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any mitigations against this type of vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The extension should warn users when they are configuring `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` to point to locations outside of trusted, known paths.
    - Documentation clarification: The documentation should explicitly warn developers about the security risks of using locally built language servers, especially from untrusted sources.
    - Code integrity checks:  While difficult for local builds, for official builds, ensure integrity checks of language server DLLs are in place to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a developer to clone a malicious Roslyn or Razor repository.
    - The developer must follow the debugging instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and configure their workspace settings to use the malicious local language server.
    - The developer must attempt to debug the C# extension in VS Code with the misconfiguration.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The file `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md` provides detailed instructions on how to set up local language servers for debugging.
    2. Sections "Configuring Roslyn Language Server" and "Configuring Razor Language Server" describe modifying workspace `settings.json` to point `dotnet.server.path` and `razor.languageServer.directory` to local DLL paths.
    3. The instructions encourage developers to use locally built debug versions of Roslyn and Razor language servers, which, if sourced from a malicious repository, could contain malicious code.
    4. The code itself does not enforce any checks on the validity or trustworthiness of the DLL paths provided in the settings.

    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious Roslyn Language Server DLL (e.g., `MaliciousLanguageServer.dll`). This DLL, when loaded, should execute a benign payload like writing to a file system or displaying a warning message as a proof of concept.
    2. Create a fake Roslyn repository structure with the malicious DLL in the expected artifact path (e.g., `$roslynRepoRoot/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer/Debug/net9.0/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll`).
    3. Create a new VS Code workspace.
    4. Open the workspace in VS Code.
    5. Edit the workspace `settings.json` file.
    6. Add the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
        "dotnet.server.waitForDebugger": true,
        "dotnet.server.path": "<path to the malicious Roslyn DLL>"
    }
    ```
    Replace `<path to the malicious Roslyn DLL>` with the actual path to the `MaliciousLanguageServer.dll` created in step 1.
    7. Open a C# file in the workspace. This should trigger the C# extension to activate.
    8. Observe if the benign payload from the malicious DLL is executed (e.g., check for the file written to the file system or the warning message displayed).
    9. If the payload executes, it confirms the vulnerability: arbitrary code execution by misconfiguring local language server debugging.
