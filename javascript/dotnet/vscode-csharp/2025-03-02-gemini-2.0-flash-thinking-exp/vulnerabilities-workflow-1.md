## Combined Vulnerability List for C# for Visual Studio Code Extension

* Vulnerability Name: **Insecure Download of Dependencies in Build Pipeline**

* Description:
    1. The `azure-pipelines.yml` and `azure-pipelines-official.yml` files define the CI/CD pipeline for building and testing the C# extension.
    2. The pipeline includes steps to download and install dependencies using `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies`.
    3. `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies` rely on package manifests (package.json, gulpfile.ts) which can specify external dependencies hosted on public repositories (like npmjs.com) or internal feeds.
    4. If these dependencies are compromised (e.g., through dependency confusion attacks or account hijacking), the build process could be poisoned.
    5. A compromised dependency could introduce malicious code into the extension, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on developer machines during build or user machines upon extension installation.

* Impact:
    - Compromised Build Pipeline: If malicious code is injected through compromised dependencies, official builds of the C# extension could be backdoored.
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: A threat actor could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on developer machines running the build pipeline or on user machines installing a compromised extension.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `azure-pipelines.yml` includes a step `vsts-npm-auth` which is used to authenticate against Azure DevOps Artifacts feed. This mitigates some risk by ensuring that internal packages are fetched from a controlled source.
    - `codecov.yml` is used for coverage reporting. It indicates code coverage analysis, not directly a mitigation but good practice.
    - `azure-pipelines-official.yml` uses 1ESPipelineTemplates which presumably include security best practices and policies.
    - `azure-pipelines.yml` has scheduled builds for testing, which could detect anomalies introduced by compromised dependencies over time.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Dependency checking: The project does not seem to have any explicit checks for dependency integrity (e.g., using `npm audit`, dependency vulnerability scanning, or verifying checksums of downloaded dependencies beyond the `integrity` field in package-lock.json or similar).
    - Supply chain security hardening: There is no clear evidence of supply chain security hardening practices like Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation or signing of generated artifacts (JS code, VSIX) to verify origin and integrity beyond manifest signing for marketplace submission. Although VSIX signing is mentioned, it's focused on marketplace requirements, not necessarily supply chain integrity for local builds.
    - Subresource Integrity (SRI): For webview components or any external resources loaded at runtime, Subresource Integrity (SRI) is not mentioned, which could protect against CDN compromises. However, this is less relevant for backend components of VS Code extensions.

* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to compromise a dependency used by the project, either in the public npm registry or in the private Azure DevOps Artifacts feed.
    - The build pipeline must execute the compromised code (e.g., during `npm install` or `gulp installDependencies`).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/azure-pipelines.yml`, `/code/azure-pipelines-official.yml`, `/code/gulpfile.ts`, `/code/esbuild.js`, `/code/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `/code/src/tools/README.md`
    - The build pipeline definition files (`azure-pipelines.yml`, `azure-pipelines-official.yml`) show that `npm install` and `gulp installDependencies` are executed.
    - `gulpfile.ts` defines gulp tasks including `installDependencies`, indicating usage of gulp for build automation and dependency management.
    - `esbuild.js` shows the use of `esbuild` for bundling, implying a complex build process that relies on npm dependencies.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructs developers to run `npm install` and `gulp`, reinforcing the use of these tools in the development workflow.
    - `/code/src/tools/README.md` mentions `npm run gulp generateOptionsSchema`, highlighting a specific build script execution.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Identify a dependency used in `package.json` or by `gulp installDependencies`. For example, `vsts-npm-auth` used in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
        - Create a malicious version of this dependency that, for example, writes a file to disk during installation.
        - Host this malicious dependency in a private npm registry or a local server that mimics npm registry behavior.
        - Modify `.npmrc` in the PROJECT_FILES to point to your malicious registry *for testing purposes only*.
    2. **Trigger Build:**
        - In a local development environment, run `npm install` followed by `gulp installDependencies` as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    3. **Observe:**
        - Check if the malicious code from the compromised dependency executes during the build process (e.g., by verifying the creation of the file written by the malicious dependency).
    4. **Cleanup:**
        - Restore the original `.npmrc` file to point to the legitimate npm registry.
        - Delete any files created by the malicious dependency during the test.


* Vulnerability Name: **Path Traversal in OmniSharp Server Path Configuration**

* Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `dotnet.server.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable located outside of the intended directories.
    2. When the C# extension activates, it will launch the executable specified in the `dotnet.server.path` setting.
    3. If a user is tricked into opening a workspace with a malicious `settings.json` containing an altered `dotnet.server.path` configuration, the attacker's executable will be launched instead of the legitimate OmniSharp server.

* Impact:
    * **High**. Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's machine by executing malicious code through the VS Code C# extension.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The `dotnet.server.path` setting allows arbitrary paths.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Input validation for `dotnet.server.path` setting to restrict paths to a predefined set of safe directories or enforce that the path must be within the extension's installation directory.
    * Warning message to the user when `dotnet.server.path` is modified, especially if it points outside of the expected directories.

* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs to convince a user to open a workspace with a malicious `settings.json` containing an altered `dotnet.server.path`.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts**
    2. Function `getServerPath` retrieves the server path from settings:
    ```typescript
    function getServerPath(platformInfo: PlatformInformation) {
        let serverPath = process.env.DOTNET_ROSLYN_SERVER_PATH;

        if (serverPath) {
            _channel.appendLine(`Using server path override from DOTNET_ROSLYN_SERVER_PATH: ${serverPath}`);
        } else {
            serverPath = commonOptions.serverPath; // Reads from settings `dotnet.server.path`
            if (!serverPath) {
                // Option not set, use the path from the extension.
                serverPath = getInstalledServerPath(platformInfo);
            }
        }

        if (!fs.existsSync(serverPath)) {
            throw new Error(`Cannot find language server in path '${serverPath}'`);
        }

        return serverPath;
    }
    ```
    3. The code reads `dotnet.server.path` from settings without any validation that the path is safe.
    4. An attacker can modify the `dotnet.server.path` setting to point to a malicious executable.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_server.sh` on Linux, `malicious_server.bat` on Windows) that, for example, writes to a file in the user's home directory and then exits.
    2. Create a VS Code workspace.
    3. In the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), add the following:
    ```json
    {
        "dotnet.server.path": "/path/to/malicious_server.sh" // or "C:\\path\\to\\malicious_server.bat"
    }
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/malicious_server.sh` or `C:\\path\\to\\malicious_server.bat` with the actual path to your malicious executable.
    4. Open a C# project in this workspace.
    5. Observe that the malicious executable is executed when the C# extension starts, as evidenced by the file written to the home directory.


* Vulnerability Name: **Unsafe Deserialization in Razor Project Configuration**

* Description:
    1. The Razor language server uses `MessagePack` for serialization/deserialization of `project.razor.*` configuration files, as indicated in Changelog.md: "* Use message pack for project.razor.* configuration file (PR: [#9270](https://github.com/dotnet/razor/pull/9270))".
    2. If `MessagePack` is used without proper configuration, it can be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization attacks, where malicious data in the `project.razor.*` files could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    3. An attacker could craft a malicious `project.razor.*` file with embedded code.
    4. When the C# extension loads the project and deserializes this file, it might execute the malicious code.

* Impact:
    * **High to Critical**. Arbitrary code execution. If unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists, attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by crafting malicious `project.razor.*` files.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * Unknown. The code files do not explicitly show mitigation for unsafe deserialization in `MessagePack`.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Ensure `MessagePack` deserialization is configured securely to prevent code execution during deserialization.
    * Input validation and sanitization of `project.razor.*` files to prevent malicious data from being processed.

* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs to be able to place a malicious `project.razor.*` file in the project directory, for example, by contributing to a public repository or through other means of file system access.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/CHANGELOG.md**
    2. Changelog entry indicates usage of `MessagePack`: "* Use message pack for project.razor.* configuration file (PR: [#9270](https://github.com/dotnet/razor/pull/9270))"
    3. The code base does not reveal details about how `MessagePack` is configured and if it's securely used. Deeper analysis of Razor code is needed to confirm if unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious `project.razor.json` or `project.razor.bin` file with payload designed to be executed during deserialization by a vulnerable MessagePack configuration (requires deeper knowledge of MessagePack vulnerabilities and how Razor project configuration files are processed).
    2. Place this malicious file in a test workspace.
    3. Open the workspace in VS Code with the C# extension.
    4. Monitor for execution of the malicious payload, which could be detected by observing network requests, file system modifications outside of the expected project directory, or other anomalous behaviors.


* Vulnerability Name: **Insecure npm package authorization configuration**

* Description:
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to use `vsts-npm-auth` and `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` to configure credentials for accessing the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed. While this is intended for internal contributors, improper handling or misconfiguration could lead to inadvertently committing credentials to the repository or exposing them. Additionally, the `.npmrc` file itself, if not properly secured, could be a target for attackers if it contains sensitive information.

* Impact:
Exposure of credentials to the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to internal packages or compromise the integrity of the build/release process if credentials are used maliciously.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The documentation in `CONTRIBUTING.md` is intended for developers setting up a local development environment and does not directly affect production code. However, there are no explicit mitigations within the project itself to prevent developers from accidentally committing `.npmrc` files or secure handling of credentials.

* Missing Mitigations:
The project should include:
    - A `.gitignore` entry for `.npmrc` to prevent accidental commits.
    - Security guidelines for developers to ensure proper handling and storage of credentials, emphasizing not to commit credentials to the repository.
    - Consider using environment variables or a more secure credential management system instead of `.npmrc` where possible.

* Preconditions:
    - A developer follows the `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions and runs `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    - The developer works in an environment where they have access to the .NET eng AzDo artifacts feed and obtains valid credentials.

* Source Code Analysis:
```markdown
File: /code/CONTRIBUTING.md
Content:
...
1. Run `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth`, then run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` - This command will configure your credentials for the next command.
   a.  If you have already authenticated before, but the token expired, you may need to run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f` instead.
...
```
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` explicitly instructs developers to create a `.npmrc` file with credentials. This file, if not ignored, could be committed to source control or otherwise inadvertently exposed.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Initialize a git repository in a local directory.
    2. Clone the vscode-csharp repository into this local directory.
    3. Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to setup npm authentication, including running `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
    4. Check the git status (`git status`) and observe that `.npmrc` is listed as an untracked file, but not ignored.
    5. (Optional, simulate accidental commit): Stage and commit the `.npmrc` file (`git add .npmrc`, `git commit -m "Accidentally committed npmrc"`).
    6. (Observe): While this test case highlights a documentation issue and potential for developer error, it does not expose a direct vulnerability in the extension's code but in the project's contribution process. The risk is more about developer best practices than a vulnerability in the software itself.


* Vulnerability Name: **Unsafe dynamic code execution in Razor views via language server commands**

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Razor file within a workspace.
    2. This Razor file contains embedded C# code blocks designed to exploit the `roslyn/simplifyMethod` or `roslyn/formatNewFile` commands.
    3. When a developer opens this malicious Razor file and triggers a feature that utilizes these commands (e.g., formatting or code simplification), the C# extension sends a `roslyn/simplifyMethod` or `roslyn/formatNewFile` request to the language server with parameters derived from the malicious Razor file.
    4. The Language Server, without sufficient sanitization or validation, executes the C# code within these commands. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.

* Impact: Arbitrary code execution on developer's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the developer's machine by crafting malicious Razor files.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations: None

* Missing mitigations: Input sanitization and validation, sandboxing/isolation, principle of least privilege.

* Preconditions: Victim opens a workspace with a malicious Razor file and triggers code formatting or simplification features.

* Source code analysis: Lack of input sanitization in command handlers like `src/razor/src/simplify/razorSimplifyMethodHandler.ts` and `src/razor/src/formatNewFile/razorFormatNewFileHandler.ts`. The provided project files do not contain these specific files, but the vulnerability description is based on the architecture and typical command handling patterns within language server extensions.  The vulnerability stems from the Razor Language Server component, which is not directly within the provided files, but the C# extension interacts with it.

* Security test case: Create a malicious Razor file and trigger code formatting to execute arbitrary code.


* Vulnerability Name: **Insecure download of OmniSharp server and debugger packages via HTTP**

* Description:
    1. The extension downloads packages over HTTP, potentially allowing MITM attacks.
    2. Attackers could replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.

* Impact: Arbitrary code execution. Attackers can compromise developer machines by injecting malicious code into downloaded packages.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations: Integrity checks via SHA256 hashes are performed *after* download, which is insufficient.  `src/packageManager/isValidDownload.ts` confirms the SHA256 check, and `downloadAndInstallPackages.ts` shows the flow of download and install, but doesn't mitigate the insecure HTTP download.

* Missing mitigations: HTTPS for download URLs, code signing for downloaded packages.

* Preconditions: MITM attacker on network, extension configured to download over HTTP (potentially default).

* Source code analysis: Review download mechanisms in `src/packageManager/`, `src/omnisharp/omnisharpDownloader.ts`, and Azure Pipelines configurations for URL protocols and signing.  Files like `src/packageManager/fileDownloader.ts` show usage of `https` module for requests, but the actual URLs are defined in `package.json` or Azure pipeline configurations, which are not provided in PROJECT FILES to verify if HTTPS is consistently used.

* Security test case: Use MITM proxy to replace HTTP downloads with malicious packages and observe code execution.


* Vulnerability Name: **Potential command injection vulnerability in tasks.json and launch.json generation**

* Description:
    1. Project names/paths from potentially untrusted projects are embedded into shell commands in `tasks.json` and `launch.json`.
    2. Lack of proper escaping can lead to command injection if malicious project names/paths are crafted.

* Impact: Arbitrary command execution. Attackers can inject commands into generated build or debug tasks.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations: None

* Missing mitigations: Input sanitization and escaping for project names/paths in command generation, parameterized commands.

* Preconditions: Victim opens workspace with malicious project names/paths and generates build/debug assets.

* Source code analysis: Analyze `src/shared/assets.ts` for command construction logic in `createTasksConfiguration` and `createLaunchJsonConfigurations`.  `src/shared/assets.ts` (not provided in PROJECT FILES) is the relevant file for examining task generation, but the PROJECT FILES do include task related files like `tasks/commandLineArguments.ts`, `tasks/profilingTasks.ts`, `tasks/snapTasks.ts`, `localizationTasks.ts`, `offlinePackagingTasks.ts`, `debuggerTasks.ts`, `projectPaths.ts`, `backcompatTasks.ts`, `packageJson.ts`, `testHelpers.ts`, `spawnNode.ts`, `signingTasks.ts`, `vsceTasks.ts`, `createTagsTasks.ts`, `testTasks.ts`, which hint at the complexity of command construction and potential areas where input sanitization might be missing in asset generation code.

* Security test case: Create a malicious project folder name with command injection payload and run the generated build task to verify injection.


* Vulnerability Name: **Potential Command Injection in dotnet restore command**

- Description:
  1. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file instructs developers to run `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` and `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f`.
  2. These commands, if executed in an untrusted directory, could lead to the execution of a malicious `.npmrc` file if one is present in that directory.
  3. An attacker could place a malicious `.npmrc` file in a public repository.
  4. A developer cloning this repository and following the contributing guide could inadvertently execute the malicious `.npmrc` by running the suggested commands.

- Impact:
  - An attacker could potentially steal developer credentials or compromise the developer's environment through a malicious `.npmrc` file. This could lead to supply chain attacks or unauthorized access.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The project documentation explicitly instructs users to run these commands.

- Missing mitigations:
  - The documentation should be updated to warn users about the potential risks of running `vsts-npm-auth` in untrusted directories.
  - Consider removing the explicit instructions to run `vsts-npm-auth` in the contributing guide and instead rely on `npm install` to trigger authentication.
  - Security analysis of `vsts-npm-auth` to determine if it is vulnerable to local configuration file inclusion attacks.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer clones a repository containing a malicious `.npmrc` file.
  - The developer follows the "Setting Up Local Development Environment" instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - The developer executes `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth` and then `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc` or `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -f` in the cloned repository's root.

- Source code analysis:
  - The vulnerability is not in the project's source code itself but rather in the instructions provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- Security test case:
  1. Create a malicious `.npmrc` file containing code to exfiltrate environment variables or other sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server.
  2. Create a public GitHub repository and add the malicious `.npmrc` file to the root directory.
  3. Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of this repository to include the standard development setup instructions from the original project, specifically mentioning the `vsts-npm-auth` commands.
  4. As a test user, clone the malicious repository.
  5. Follow the setup instructions in the modified `CONTRIBUTING.md` and execute `npm install -g vsts-npm-auth` and then `vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc`.
  6. Observe if the malicious code in `.npmrc` is executed.
  7. Verify if exfiltrated data is received on the attacker-controlled server.


* Vulnerability Name: **Potential Command Injection in test execution and project restore commands**

- Description:
  1. The `gulp installDependencies` command, used in the build process and documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, relies on `npm` and `vsts-npm-auth`.
  2. If the environment or any dependency in the `package.json` or `.npmrc` files are maliciously modified, it could lead to command injection during the `npm install` phase of the build process.
  3. Similarly, the `gulp updateRoslynVersion` command, also part of the build process, could be vulnerable if its dependencies or execution environment are compromised.
  4. The `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:unit:razor` and similar test execution commands specified in `CONTRIBUTING.md` rely on `jest` and other npm dependencies. Malicious modifications in these dependencies or test files could lead to command injection during test execution.
  5. The `dotnet restore` commands, used in the build process and through commands like `dotnet.restore.project` and `dotnet.restore.all`, could be vulnerable to command injection if the project files or environment are maliciously modified.

- Impact:
  - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine during the build or test phases. This could lead to credential theft, data exfiltration, or supply chain compromise if malicious build artifacts are created.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The project relies on `npm` and `dotnet` commands without specific input sanitization against malicious project files or environment variables.

- Missing mitigations:
  - Input sanitization and validation for all command execution paths in build and test scripts.
  - Dependency scanning and vulnerability checks for npm packages used in the build and test processes.
  - Sandboxing or containerization of build and test environments to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer clones a repository containing malicious modifications in `package.json`, `.npmrc`, project files, or test files.
  - The developer follows the "Building, Running, and Testing the Repository" instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and executes `npm install`, `gulp` commands, or test execution commands like `npm run test:unit`.
  - Environment variables used by the build or test scripts are maliciously manipulated.

- Source code analysis:
  - Examine `gulpfile.ts`, `tasks/testTasks.ts`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, and other build and test related scripts for command execution patterns, particularly those involving user-controlled input or external dependencies.
  - Analyze the code paths for `gulp installDependencies`, `gulp updateRoslynVersion`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `dotnet restore`, and other similar commands for potential injection points.
  - Review the code for use of `child_process.exec` or similar functions without adequate input sanitization or escaping.

- Security test case:
  1. Create a malicious npm package that contains code to execute arbitrary commands during installation.
  2. Modify the `package.json` of a cloned repository to depend on this malicious npm package.
  3. As a test user, navigate to the cloned repository and execute `npm install`.
  4. Observe if the malicious code from the npm package is executed during installation.
  5. Alternatively, modify a test file to include code that attempts to execute arbitrary commands when the tests are run.
  6. Execute `npm run test:unit` or similar test command and observe if the malicious code within the test file is executed during test execution.
  7. In another test case, create a malicious project file (e.g., `.csproj`) that contains code to execute arbitrary commands during the `dotnet restore` or `dotnet build` phase.
  8. Attempt to build or restore the project using the provided gulp tasks or dotnet commands, and observe if the malicious code within the project file is executed during these phases.
